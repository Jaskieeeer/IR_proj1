Baldur's Gate 3 (also known as BG3 and Baldur's Gate III) is a 2023 role-playing video game by Larian Studios. It is the third installment in the Baldur's Gate series. The game's full release for Windows happened in August, with PlayStation 5, macOS, and Xbox Series X/S later in the same year. In the game's narrative, the party seeks to cure themselves of a parasitic tadpole infecting their brain. It can be played alone or in a group.    
Adapted from the fifth edition of tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, Baldur's Gate 3 takes its mechanics and setting, the Forgotten Realms, from the tabletop game. Players create a highly customisable character and embark on quests with a party of voiced companions. Alternatively, they can play as a companion instead. The gameplay comprises real-time exploration of large areas, turn-based combat, and narrative choices which impact the party and the wider world. Outcomes for combat, dialogue and world interaction are generally determined by rolling a 20-sided die.  
Baldur's Gate (1998) and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (2000) were developed by BioWare. A third game, subtitled The Black Hound and developed by Black Isle, was cancelled in 2003 following a licensing dispute. Dungeons and Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast (WotC) declined Larian's first pitch to make the game following the release of Divinity: Original Sin (2014). Impressed by pre-release material for Divinity: Original Sin II (2017), WotC welcomed a new pitch and eventually greenlit Larian's development. The company grew considerably in the six-year production. In August 2020, Larian released the game's first act in early access, providing them with player feedback and revenue. After the full release, Larian added free new content to the game until the final patch in April 2025. 
Baldur's Gate 3 received critical acclaim and had record-breaking awards success, with praise directed at its cinematic visuals, writing, production quality, and performances. It became the first title to win Game of the Year at all five major video game awards ceremonies and received the same accolade from several publications. It was financially successful, generating significant profit for both Larian Studios and WotC's parent company Hasbro.  It has been regarded as one of the greatest video games ever made.
Baldur's Gate 3 is a role-playing game,[7] and can be played in single-player or multiplayer.[b] It has a free-floating camera, with players able to adjust the perspective from top-down isometric to third person.[10] Based on the fifth edition rules of the tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D 5e),[7] several mechanics are identical between the two.[11][c] A major feature is that outcomes are decided by rolling a twenty-sided die (d20).[13][d] Some rolls occur with ""advantage"" or ""disadvantage"", meaning two d20s are rolled and the player receives the best or worst result, respectively.[15] The game includes support for modding, but using them disables achievements.[16]
In character creation, the player selects a class,[e] species,[f] and backstory.[g][22] If the selected class uses magic, they will also choose their starting spells.[18] Characters level up by collecting experience points by several means—examples include exploration, combat, and solving puzzles. Levelling up provides access to new class features.[23] The maximum player level of Baldur's Gate 3 is level 12; in the tabletop game, the limit is level 20.[24][12] Available at certain level intervals are feats.[25] These diversify or specialise a character's style of play.[26] With each feat, players choose a new ability or increase their stats,[25] which are called abilities.[h][27] After levelling up, players can also choose to place a level into a different class, known as multiclassing.[i]
The game is divided into three acts,[28] with a large, explorable location tied to each.[29] In non-combat scenarios, the game is primarily experienced in real time.[27][j] There are 288 quests,[31]: 1:23  with significant creative freedom as to how they are completed,[28] some being mutually exclusive, and some unfolding across multiple arcs.[32] Companions have their own side quests, but the game can be completed without companion presence.[33] Almost any character can die,[34] including those integral to the narrative,[28] and all speaking characters are fully voiced.[35] Using a spell or potion, players can speak to any encountered animal,[36] and a more limited number of corpses.[37]
Players can set up a camp as a way to rest from the adventure and talk with companions.[38] There are 17 unique camp locations, contextually dependent on where in the game world the camp is set up.[39] A non-player character based at camp, Withers, allows players to respec.[40] Limited resources—for example, hit points and spell slots—are replenished by resting. There are two types of rest: long and short. A short rest restores 50% of the characters' maximum hit points alongside some class-specific features. Players can short rest twice before they must long rest to replenish them. Long rests teleport players back to camp and fully replenish resources.[40]
Players select items in the world, such as chests, to interact with them.[27] Items, like explosive barrels, can be sent to a camp stash and retrieved later.[41] Picking locks, disarming traps, and exploring locations grant experience.[23] If the player attempts to pick a lock, the game rolls a dice; the result is compared against the value required to open the lock. A character's skills or abilities can add to the rolled value, making it easier.[13]
The game's combat systems are modelled on D&D 5e.[27] Entering combat switches the game to turn-based mode.[27] A d20 roll, called an initiative roll, determines the order in which each character acts.[k] In a turn, each character has limited resources.[43] The primary resources are actions, bonus actions, and movement.[43] Major instructions to a character, like attacking with a sword or casting a spell, consume an action. Smaller commands, like jumping or drinking a potion,[l] consume a bonus action.[45] Characters can also move a set distance. When the player has finished the available actions for a character, their turn ends; combat is finished when all enemies are defeated.[43] The player can also have controlled characters leave combat by moving sufficiently far from enemies. The outcomes of player actions—for example, whether an attack hits and how much damage it deals—are primarily determined through dice rolls.[43][45]
When a character attacks, the game rolls a d20—this is called an attack roll.[43] The result is compared against the target's armour class; if the roll value is lower than the armour class, the attack misses.[46] Players can see the percentage-chance that an attack will hit before making it; this value is impacted by things like terrain.[43] Some attacks have damage types. These can amplify one another (e.g., applying grease and fire to a target will make them burn for multiple turns) or counteract the other's effect (e.g., shooting a fire arrow at an enemy standing in ice will melt the ice, leaving a water surface).[47] Environmental elements like explosive barrels can be exploited,[43] and weapons can be dipped in poison.[47]
Conversations are another area of gameplay in Baldur's Gate 3. Some conversations include skill checks, wherein the player rolls a d20, with the result affecting the outcome. Players can initiate combat by selecting an aggressive dialogue option,[48] or use dialogue to avoid combat entirely.[49] This is a major feature of the charisma-focused bard class.[48] Dialogue options can involve persuasion, intimidation, and deception.[50]
Player characters can initiate romance or sexual relationships with many non-player characters.[51] Actions and dialogue options affect relationship outcomes.[52] Characters that can be romanced are ""playersexual"", meaning the player character's gender does not impact romance availability.[53][51] The game has thirteen romance options.[52]
Baldur's Gate 3 shares its Dungeons and Dragons setting, called the Forgotten Realms, with previous games in the franchise. BG3 and its predecessors take place on the continent of Faerûn, primarily near or inside the namesake city of Baldur's Gate. BG3 occurs over 100 years after the events of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (2000) and shortly after the events of the D&D tie-in adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus (2019).[54] The game features monsters from the Forgotten Realms, including owlbears,[55] gnolls,[56] and mind flayers.[28]
The game's first act has no designated tutorial, but certain resources and encounters throughout the act are deliberately constructed to guide the player.[57] The act is primarily set around a mind flayer ship wreckage.[58] Players have access to several locations, including a druids' grove, goblin camp, and a monastery set against a mountain pass.[29] Writer Ali Jones characterises the first act as ""fairytale backdrop"", and IGN's Leana Hafer said it was ""mostly idyllic wilderness"".[59] Eight of the game's ten companions are introduced in act one, with six recruitable near the start.[60] The Underdark is a large subterranean area accessible through multiple locations; each entrance leads to unique environments.[58] Act one ends when players traverse the mountain pass or Underdark to reach act two's setting.[61] In act two, players traverse the Shadow Cursed lands to reach Moonrise Towers,[29] an oppressive and dark environment.[59][62][63] Only one companion is introduced in act two.[60] Locations explored include the Last Light Inn[59] and the Gauntlet of Shar.[64] The third and final act is primarily set in the dense city environment of Baldur's Gate,[29] but with some areas accessible outside of the city, like a visiting circus and the shoreline.[65] The city is the location of the tenth and final recruitable companion.[60]
The world, alongside the player's thoughts and observations, are recounted by the game's narrator (Amelia Tyler), acting as BG3's dungeon master. While the narrator was originally planned to deliver lines contemptuously, Larian was impressed by Tyler's deadpan delivery.[66] Of the ten companions, six can be chosen as the player character in the character creator. Known as origin characters, they have a pre-set character class, race, and appearance. Although their classes can be changed, origin character personalities and backstories are sometimes related to them.[67]
The seventh origin character, the Dark Urge, cannot be recruited.[n] The Dark Urge narrative is linked closely with the main narrative. In this origin, the player is compulsively evil and can choose to resist or indulge these desires.[85]
There are four non-origin characters who can be recruited:
The game's overarching villain is the Absolute, voiced by prolific voice actress Cissy Jones, who controls the mind flayers.[91] Three other antagonists control the elder brain—Ketheric Thorm, Enver Gortash, and Orin the Red.[92] Actor J. K. Simmons portrays Ketheric Thorm,[93] a tragic villain planned as recruitable in early development.[94] Jason Isaacs and Maggie Robertson portray Enver Gortash and Orin the Red, respectively.[95][96] The Emperor is a mind flayer detached from the species' hive mind. A controversial, complex character,[97] and a player romance option, he was voiced by Scott Joseph.[98] Raphael, a devil, is a supporting villain encountered early who offers the player a deal to remove the parasite in their head.[99][100] Voice actor Andrew Wincott portrays Raphael as a theatrical villain influenced by Shakespeare's Iago.[101]
The protagonist wakes up inside a giant dimension-crossing illithid (mind flayer) flying ship. They are infected with a parasitic tadpole that enthralls and transforms people into illithids; however, the transformation does not happen, and the ship comes under attack from githyanki warriors riding red dragons. The mind flayer crew teleports the ship to the Nine Hells and are attacked by an army of Devils. The protagonist is freed during the fighting and steers the damaged ship to Faerûn, where it crashes. They encounter other survivors of the wreck, all likewise implanted with tadpoles.
The party seeks to remove their parasites through numerous avenues, all of which fail to provide a cure. They are saved from the tadpoles' overwhelming psychic force by a ""Dream Visitor"" inside Shadowheart's mysterious prism, a device that is sought after by the githyanki. The protagonist then becomes involved in the fate of the Emerald Grove, where local druids and tiefling refugees face off against the goblin horde that worships a cult of the ""Absolute"". Once the party either sacks or saves the grove, they travel through the mountains or the Underdark to reach Moonrise Towers, a cultist stronghold, in search of a new cure.
The protagonist seeks sanctuary from the curse around Moonrise Towers in a tavern called the Last Light, held by a group of tiefling refugees, Flaming Fist conscripts, and Harpers. General Ketheric Thorm, the reigning lord of Moonrise and Chosen of Myrkul, is using a relic named the ""Nightsong"" as an engine for his immortality. The party scours the Gauntlet of Shar, a deserted temple to the goddess of darkness and loss, in pursuit of the Nightsong, revealed to be Dame Aylin, a daughter of Selûne, the goddess of the moon and Shar's sister. After either slaying or freeing the Nightsong, the protagonist confronts Ketheric, as well as his cohorts—Orin the Red (the Chosen of Bhaal) and Enver Gortash (the Chosen of Bane). Through their Netherstones and a mysterious crown, the triumvirate collectively controls the Absolute (revealed to be an Elder Brain, the ultimate form of the illithid race) and seeks to rule the Sword Coast by manipulating everyone infected with a tadpole. Orin and Gortash depart with the Elder Brain for Baldur's Gate, while the protagonist defeats Ketheric and claims his Netherstone.
The protagonist arrives at Baldur's Gate as Gortash and Orin attempt to pit them against the other, while the companions find closure for their personal quests. It is revealed that the ""Dream Visitor"" is, in fact, a visage taken by a renegade illithid called the Emperor, who resides within the prism and oversees the imprisonment of a powerful githyanki, Orpheus. Orpheus is the source of psionic resistance the party possesses against the Absolute, and the Emperor has been leveraging this in his favour. The protagonist eventually faces off against Gortash and Orin, assembling the Netherstones to subdue the Elder Brain. The Elder Brain, having anticipated the triumvirate and the protagonist's every move, overpowers the party before the Emperor comes to the rescue.
Realizing that the Netherstones require an illithid wielder with Orpheus' powers to be effective, the protagonist either frees Orpheus and allows him to transform, which causes the Emperor to resign to his fate and join the Absolute, or has either the Emperor, a transformed Karlach, or the player character consume Orpheus in order to see the mission through. After defeating the Elder Brain, the protagonist can choose to either kill it and every illithid tadpole with it, ending the threat forever, or betray their comrades and rule as the Absolute.
The Baldur's Gate series began development in 1995 when Wizards of the Coast's predecessor, TSR, Inc., asked publisher Interplay Entertainment to produce a video game using the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) property. BioWare agreed to develop the title, having formed a partnership with Interplay for Shattered Steel (1996). Initially titled Iron Throne, the game was retitled Baldur's Gate (1998) at the suggestion of Interplay co-founder Brian Fargo.[102] Created by a largely inexperienced group of developers,[103]: 1  BioWare delivered the game a year behind Interplay's schedule and achieved commercial success, leading to an expansion in 1999.[102][o] A direct sequel followed, Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (2000), using the second edition of D&D for its rule set,[104] and was also published by Interplay and Black Isle Studios.[103]: 3  The first two Baldur's Gate games provided pre-scripted, branching narratives. BioWare's third game with the D&D property, Neverwinter Nights (2002), used D&D's third edition,[104] and facilitated a gameplay experience closer to the tabletop game by emphasising multiplayer and allowing players to control non-player characters.[106][p] Following a licensing issue, another Dungeons and Dragons video game, The Black Hound, was designated as the third game in the Baldur's Gate series; it was cancelled when Interplay lost the rights to release Baldur's Gate titles on PC.[105]
Several companies sought the rights to make the title over the following decade. Interplay's Brian Fargo described interest from Obsidian Entertainment's CEO Feargus Urquhart, Larian Studios' CEO Swen Vincke, and Fargo himself.[108] Canadian developer Beamdog made enhanced editions of the first and second games, followed by Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear (2016), a large expansion using the Infinity Engine.[109] Cameron Tofer, co-founder of Beamdog, said making the third game was the studio's ""long-term goal"".[110]
Vincke first approached Wizards of the Coast (WotC) about making the game during Larian's development of Divinity: Original Sin (2014), but WotC declined, citing their inexperience.[q] Shortly before the release of the sequel, Divinity: Original Sin II (2017), WotC were intrigued by pre-release footage and asked Larian for a pitch for Baldur's Gate 3. Vincke created a design document around a month before the release of Original Sin II in a hotel room with several designers and writers.[112] The pitch was scheduled for the release day of Original Sin II, leading to a short turnaround time. WotC did not like the pitch, but granted Larian's request for more time.[113][80] WotC had a new chief executive officer at this time and Vincke met him on one of his first days. Larian had to meet several milestones, including an approved design document.[114]: 5:52  A later pitch was received positively and WotC granted Larian the licence.[80][112] In an October 2019 Twitter post, Fargo said he knew who was developing Baldur's Gate 3.[115]
Larian wanted to produce a game with triple-A production values, budget, and marketing;  they viewed Baldur's Gate, alongside Fallout and Ultima, as an intellectual property capable of enabling that.[116] Larian built new cinematic functionality into their game engine, viewing these capabilities as key to accessibility. The studio's cinematic ambitions came with challenges,[7] requiring the studio grow considerably.[117] Close-up dialogue scenes required new teams responsible for cinematics quality assurance and lighting. The size of the art and audio teams increased because the technical requirements differed from those of Original Sin II. Clothing designs and textures, for example, had to work from close and far perspectives because of the cinematic camera.[117][3] Baldur's Gate 3 uses technology from the eighth generation of video game consoles, like screen-spaced reflections and shadow maps for lighting and shadow.[118]
The studio's size increased from around 140 employees in 2017 to over 450 in 2023, making it one of the world's largest privately owned video game companies.[117] Industry journalist Jason Schreier described Larian Studios as a ""unicorn"": large enough to make triple-A games but not subject to the mechanics mandated by publicly traded publishers, like microtransactions and battle passes, that ""maximize revenue"" and ""minimize risk"".[119]
In part due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Baldur's Gate 3 had an unusually long 6-year development cycle.[117] Larian closed its Saint Petersburg office following the invasion. Anticipating military enlistment for staff, they liaised with embassies and consulates to support relocation efforts, with 90% of employees based in Saint Petersburg moving office. The game's complex code base meant the effects of closing the office were felt throughout development.[120]
Vincke described Baldur's Gate 3 as Larian's ""Covid game"",[121] with the pandemic reducing productivity, causing communication issues internally and with external partners, and preventing performance motion capture.[122] The studio lost staff over the 6-year development period,[121] including cinematics lead Jim Southworth, who died shortly after the game's release.[123] The credits bear a dedication to Southworth.[2]
Dungeons and Dragons creative director Mike Mearls said the team welcomed Larian changes to D&D lore, hoping changes would tie into increased player agency.[124] Mearls said that collaborating with Larian felt like a natural extension of Wizards of the Coast's D&D team, with both companies anticipating required adjustments to fifth-edition rules.[125] Vincke suggested using mind flayers as antagonists after seeing an illustration in Volo's Guide to Monsters.[7] Writer Adam Smith said WotC had not documented the process of transforming into one, so Larian produced a 7-day timeline,[4] inspired by body horror and the films of David Cronenberg.[126] Baldur's Gate 3 is set over 100 years after the first two entries; Smith said WotC had ""filled out"" the intervening century because the area was integral to the Forgotten Realms and Sword Coast settings.[127] Larian collaborated with WotC on a precursor module for the game,[127] Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus (2019). The module provided information on events occurring since Baldur's Gate II.[124]
Larian had two London-based studios working on motion capture. Vincke estimated this spanned 1.5 million words of dialogue in 2020;[7] in 2024, Vincke estimated 1.3 million lines and over 140 hours of cutscenes.[128][r] In development, the multiplayer mode allowed players to role play with their partner, but the feature was removed because of the added complexity.[130] All 248 of the game's voice actors performed the motion capture for their characters.[131] There are over 170 ending variations,[117][s] which required substantial testing,[5]: 16:27  and Larian's writers worked on ending dialogue and descriptions for over a year.[77] Larian encouraged the main cast to interact with fans, which Devora Wilde, who portrays Lae'zel, said was unusual in the industry.[80]
Smith described the team's approach as ""reactive"", saying that identifying frequent player choices informed their writing decisions.[127] Some characters were changed substantially throughout development. Larian reduced the hostility of companions to the player character, including Shadowheart and Lae'zel.[77] Karlach's infernal heart was a late addition to the game.[77] According to region producer Elena Statsenko, Larian aimed to incorporate moral dilemmas and outcome variety for different player types into quests.[31]: 1:23  Other design considerations included integration with the main story and adjustments if the player controlled an origin character.[31]: 5:29 
Larian Studios revealed Baldur's Gate 3 with a trailer at a conference for Google's cloud gaming platform, Stadia, in July 2019.[113] Vincke said letting potential customers play without installing the game had ""great conversion power"", but stated the title would not be exclusive to Stadia.[133] Following Google's discontinuation of Stadia in 2023, Vincke expressed regret, describing it as ""a really stupid deal"", but said the funds provided by the deal had funded the game's visuals.[134]
Larian partially released an unfinished version of the game's first act into early access in October 2020. The early access had over 2.5 million players[117] with the resulting revenue sustaining the studio.[135] The game's scope increased throughout this period.[117] Some companions were not recruitable in the early access,[77] and it contained many bugs.[80] Other changes included new character classes and subclasses, user interface updates and game balancing.[136][137] Eurogamer's Ruth Cassidy said that the changes to characterisation before the full release, such as decreasing hostility to the player and increasing their vulnerability, felt like fan service.[138] Continuous rewriting of the script required voice actors to return to the studio.[80]
During early access the game's Steam user reviews dropped below 75%, which Vincke characterised as a ""disaster"".[139] IGN, PC Gamer and GameSpot's reviewers said it was fun but that bugs meant waiting for the full release would be advantageous,[140][141][142] with David Wildgoose describing the game as ""rough"", ""messy"", and ""just barely hanging together"".[142] Ars Technica and Siliconera's reviews said the early access provided an overall disappointing experience.[143][144]
Larian experienced issues while developing a version for Xbox Series X and Series S.[145] Performance variation between the two consoles in split-screen co-operative play was an issue because feature parity was a requirement of the Xbox platform.[146]  Following an in-person meeting with Microsoft Games executive Phil Spencer at Gamescom, Vincke and Spencer arranged a compromise where the game could be brought to Xbox consoles without split-screen play on the Xbox Series S.[147]
In March 2023, Larian Studios staff were concerned that the game would be delayed to avoid competition from another title, Bethesda Softworks' Starfield, after the lengthy development cycle. Vincke accelerated the game's Windows release by four weeks,[117] and delayed the PlayStation 5 version by one week.[148] The game was released for Windows on 3 August 2023,[55] PlayStation 5 on 6 September 2023,[149] and macOS on 22 September 2023.[150] Following the PlayStation 5 version's launch, Larian revealed an animated short, ""The Launch Party"", co-produced with UK-based animation studio Mashed.[151] On 7 December 2023, directly following The Game Awards 2023, Larian released Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series X and Series S.[152]
After release, Larian Studios provided new content and improvements via patching, with release dates sometimes varying by platform.[153] Released for PC in August 2023, the first patch added over 1,000 bug fixes and balance changes, alongside increased polish for animations.[154] The September 2023 update permitted players to customise their appearance,[155] support for modding, and increased the number of endings for evil playthroughs.[156] A November 2023 patch added customisation for player characters and hirelings; increased the frequency of autosaving; and new idle animations.[157] In December 2023, the developer added two difficulty modes and an expanded epilogue featuring over 3,500 new lines of dialogue.[158] An eighth and final patch was released in April 2025. The patch introduced 12 new sub-classes, a photo mode, cross-platform play,[159] and co-operative split-screen for Xbox Series S.[160] Jasmine Gould-Wilson regretted that GamesRadar+ could not name BG3 as their 2024 game of the year despite extensive changes to the changes.[161]
The developer was widely criticised for not providing full credits for localisation teams involved in the game. Vincke blamed the error on Larian's localisation provider, Altagram, and promised a fix.[162] Altagram published an apology.[163]
Larian released a physical edition of the game but the disc did not contain the full game, instead providing a downloader for it. The game's full soundtrack was distributed across three discs, and it featured a cloth-printed map, stickers, and a chalk-paper mind flayer poster.[164]
According to review aggregator website Metacritic, Baldur's Gate 3 received ""universal acclaim"" from critics,[165][166][167] with 98% of critics recommending the game on aggregator OpenCritic.[168] Critics praised the game's detail and scope, with several comparing the studio to a gracious dungeon master,[22][28][176][55][18][174] and describing the game as faithfully emulating the tabletop Dungeons and Dragons experience.[151][55][118] The Guardian's Nick Rueben said the game enabled players to solve problems creatively.[22] Several reviews praised the game's production quality, citing the cinematics, performance capture, and fully voiced cast.[55][169][34] Polygon's Gita Jackson described the game as a ""masterpiece"" with limits imposed by a flawed tabletop predecessor.[173]
The writing received wide praise.[55][169][28] IGN's Leana Hafer said the side quests were ""strong"",[55] with Allen Van Aken praising quest outcome variety;[169] Dekker said the game rightly prioritised player freedom over satisfying quest resolution.[28] Eurogamer's Ruth Cassidy criticised the main narrative as having false urgency.[138] Windows Central's Jennifer Young said narrative decisions had weight because almost every character could die.[34] PCMag's reviewers criticised that some choices could inadvertently prevent players accessing some plot lines.[18] The Dark Urge character origin received dedicated coverage.[177][178][179]
Several reviews praised the characters as elevating the narrative above standard fantasy tropes and archetypes.[169][28] Andrew Zucosky, the reviewer for Digital Trends, said the companions' stories were his main motivation for playing.[35] Ali Jones said companion's personalities contrasted well with their character classes—for example, Shadowheart as a healer ""[serving] a goddess of darkness and loss"" and Karlach as a traumatised barbarian ""determined to draw on joy"".[180] Jackson praised the companion's reactivity, highlighting the vampire spawn Astarion's embrace of his freedom.[173] Eurogamer's Ruth Cassidy criticised the rushed initiation of romance arcs,[138] while PCMag's reviewers praised them for developing naturally and being ""unabashedly sexual"".[18] Hafer and Jones praised the romance overall,[55] with Jones describing the approach as more ""mature"" than ""picking the right dialogue options"".[180] A month after launch, Vincke explained that a bug had made companions ""so horny"".[181]
Some reviewers praised BG3's combat, citing the range of options,[171][63][172][138] reactivity,[28][182][18] and approaches enabling combat avoidance.[172][34][171] Eric Van Allen of Destructoid said combat ""ranges from interesting to overwhelming"".[182] Cassidy praised the game for encouraging positional strategy and preparation.[138] Two critics suggested that the game's complexity would be divisive.[183][174] Some reviewers described combat as tedious.[173][34] Polygon's Maddy Myers criticised some elements as unintuitive, citing how weapons are dipped in poison by interacting with them as if they are a health potion instead of the ""dip weapon"" function.[47] Jackson said she saved before every combat encounter because random outcomes often had devastating, uncontrollable consequences.[173] Young said combat would be ""daunting"" to D&D newcomers.[34]
There were complaints about bugs and diminishing polish in later portions of the game. The original review by Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia said the PC version's technical polish was impressive.[118] Following suggestions by players to review the end of the game, Battaglia noted substantial performance drops in the third act caused by the city's density.[184] Rebekah Valentine said the game's size concealed issues with the final act, describing it as less polished than the preceding two;[185] several other reviewers highlighted bugs.[55][28]  Writing for Digital Spy, Jess Lee said ""cracks began to show"" in act three, citing two companions reacting with relationship-ending anger to a decision and forgetting shortly thereafter.[186] According to IGN, bug complaints persisted months beyond release;[80][t] the game's first major patch fixed over 1000 bugs.[188] PC Gamer's Fraser Brown, meanwhile, expressed surprise at how few bugs surfaced on his playthrough given BG3's scope and complexity.[63]
Prior to the game's full release, Jason Schreier wrote that its success was likely, citing positive reception to the early access, strong pre-order sales, and high interest in the Dungeons and Dragons property.[117] The game sold 2.5 million copies during the early access period.[117]
It became one of 2023's largest launches after release.[189] In February 2024, Larian's publishing director Michael Douse said the game had over 10 million players.[u][191] As of 2023[update], Larian has not released precise sales figures.[123] The Irish Independent reported that Larian's 2023 pre-tax profit reached €249 million, a twentyfold from the previous year,[v] and citing 15 million copies sold.[193]
Vincke described the game's performance as ""way beyond"" expectations; he had been concerned the game's entire audience had purchased it during early access.[194] In a Q4 2023 earnings call, Wizards of the Coast's parent company Hasbro said the game had earned the company $90 million.[195] Douse said the game's player count increased 20% over 2024, with IGN's Wesley Yin-Poole attributing this to modding support.[196]
Baldur's Gate 3 had record-breaking award success continuing over a year beyond its release. According to Vincke, Larian sent rotating groups of staff to award ceremonies because it started to impact the studio's development activities.[197] In April 2024, the game became the first to win Game of the Year, or the equivalent category, at all five major ceremonies: the Golden Joystick Awards, the Game Developers Choice Awards, the DICE Awards, the BAFTAs, and The Game Awards.[198] Several publications also selected Baldur's Gate 3 as the best title of the year, including Ars Technica,[199] GameSpot,[200] GamesRadar+,[201] and PC Gamer.[202] It won the 2024 Hugo Award for Best Game or Interactive Work.[203]
At the Golden Joystick Awards, the game broke the previous record with seven wins, including Best Storytelling, Best Visual Design, and Studio of the Year for Larian.[204]  At The Game Awards, the game won in six of the nine nominated categories, including Best Role Playing Game, Best Community Support, and Best Multiplayer Game.[205] Baldur's Gate 3 was one of two titles to win multiple awards at the 27th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards,[w] receiving Role-Playing Game of the Year alongside Outstanding Achievements in Story, Game Design, and Game Direction.[206] At the BAFTA Game Awards, the title won five awards; lead writer Sarah Baylus and composer Borislav Slavov accepted the awards for Best Narrative and Best Music, respectively.[207] At the 24th Game Developers Choice Awards in San Francisco, it received four awards, including Best Narrative and Best Design.[208] It led The Steam Awards in 2023 with two wins, including Game of the Year and Outstanding Story-Rich Game.[209]
The game's performances received awards recognition. Neil Newbon (Astarion) won Best Supporting Performer at the Golden Joysticks and Best Performance at The Game Awards.[204][205] Newbon shared nominated with the game's narrator, Amelia Tyler, at several ceremonies, including the New York Game Awards and the Golden Joysticks.[210] Newbon's performance was also nominated at the DICE Awards alongside Samantha Béart (Karlach).[206] At the BAFTAs, Newbon, Béart and Tyler were nominated for Performer in a Leading Role. There were three nominations for the Performer in a Supporting Role award: Tracy Wiles (Jaheira), Dave Jones (Halsin) and Andrew Wincott (Raphael),[211] with Wincott's performance winning.[207] Several awards were for BG3's LGBTQ representation. It won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Video Game.[212] At the 2024 Gayming Awards, it received four nominations, including two for Best LGBTQ Character, winning with Shadowheart, and the Game of the Year.[213]
The game's score, and composer Borislav Slavov, received several nominations. In 2020 and 2021, he received Hollywood Music in Media Awards nominations for Original Song – Video Games (""Weeping Dawn"" and ""I Want to Live"", respectively),[214][215] and for the full score in 2023.[216] Slavov was nominated for Best Score and Music at The Game Awards.[205] Slavov won in the Music category at the BAFTAs.[207]
Following release, Larian reiterated interest in updating the game via patches but would not commit to downloadable content (DLC).[217] While delivering a March 2024 talk at Game Developers Conference, Vincke announced the studio would not develop a sequel or downloadable content.[218] While Larian started to work on DLC because of fan demand, there was no passion for the idea internally.[219] Larian subsequently said it was working on two projects,[220] using their own intellectual property for both and targeting a pre-2030 release for the first.[221]
As of 2025[update], there were several Dungeons & Dragons video games in production,[222] including one by Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance developer Invoke Studios,[223][224] a life simulation RPG by French developer Gameloft,[225][226] and an action-adventure game by Stig Asmussen's studio Giant Skull.[227][228] Another D&D project, a live service game by Swedish developer Starbreeze Studios, was cancelled in October 2025.[229][230] Hasbro's digital games vice-president Dan Ayoub said in March 2025 that discussions were ongoing over the future of Baldur's Gate and hoped to announce plans in the near future.[231]

Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear is an expansion pack for the role-playing video game Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition developed and published by Beamdog. The expansion was the first new original content to the Baldur's Gate series released after more than 10 years, and its plot takes place between the events of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. Gameplay remained similar to Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, although a class, companions and areas have been added. Siege of Dragonspear received mixed reviews by video game publications who appreciated the return to the franchise after a long hiatus. It received backlash from some consumers who criticized the general quality of the writing and the introduction of a transgender non-playable character.
Like Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, Siege of Dragonspear follows the rules of the 2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, licensed by Wizards of the Coast.
The game takes place shortly after the conclusion of Baldur's Gate and centers on a mysterious crusade to the north of Baldur's Gate city, led by a warrior named Caelar Argent who is known as the Shining Lady.
The story begins several weeks after Sarevok's death, with the player character's party hunting the remains of Sarevok's forces in the sewers and catacombs of the city. Shortly after, word arrives in the city of Caelar Argent's crusade, warning that she is making her way down along the Sword Coast and threatening the city. The player is sent with a contingent of Flaming Fist soldiers (sent by Duke Eltan) to halt Argent's advance at Dragonspear Castle. The company is joined by forces from several other major cities of the Coast who are also threatened by Argent's crusade. Throughout the journey, the player is visited by a hooded man who teaches the player more about his heritage and how to use it.
The main river crossing is destroyed by Caelar's forces, and the coalition is forced to cross at the last standing bridge along the river where Bhaal, the player character's father, had been killed by the mad god Cyric years earlier. After driving Argent's forces back, the player suffers a vision of Bhaal's death and burns his symbol into the bridge, lowering the morale of the coalition soldiers. The player's party must sneak into Dragonspear Castle and learn what they can about Argent and gather intel on her forces. Inside the castle, the player character discovers Argent's chief lieutenant communicating with an unknown source before they are discovered and forced to leave the castle without gathering any information.
The coalition attacks Dragonspear castle after successfully repelling an attack from Caelar's army, and destroys most of her forces. Caelar is trapped in the keep, so she has her chief lieutenant Hephernaan cast a paralysis spell over the whole keep. However, his spell traps Caelar as well and his true intentions are revealed: he planned to use the Bhaalspawn's blood to open the portal to the Nine Hells to unleash his master and his army upon the Material Plane. Caelar and her surviving men, along with the player character and their party, travel into the portal to stop Hephernaan. It is revealed that Hephernaan's master is Belhifet, a demon who was cast into the Nine Hells as punishment one hundred years prior. After defeating him and Hephernaan, Argent reveals that her true intention was to free her uncle from the Nine Hells and all the death that has occurred has been in pursuit of retrieving him. Caelar stays behind to seal the portal, trapping herself in the Nine Hells forever as punishment for her actions.
The player character returns to the Material Plane and the coalition celebrates Caelar's defeat at Dragonspear. Later that night, the player character suffers a nightmare of an avatar of Bhaal attacking him. It is revealed that the ""avatar"" was Skie Silvershield, a companion from the first game and the only child of Grand Duke Entar Silvershield, one of the dukes of Baldur's Gate. The player character is arrested and dragged back to the city in irons. Many call for him to be executed, but Grand Duke Belt informs the player character that he will be smuggled out of the city in order to avoid execution as a reward for all the service that he has done for the city. After escaping the city, the player character is met by Imoen, Minsc, Dynaheir, Khalid, and Jaheira, who promise to always travel with them. Shortly after, they are ambushed by unseen figures, setting up the beginning of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. It is also revealed that the hooded man is Jon Irenicus, the antagonist of the second game.
Siege of Dragonspear was revealed in July 2015, during a live event hosted by Beamdog as a bridge between the events of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.[1] Trent Oster, game director and co-founder of Beamdog, described the development of the game as: ""We move from custodian to creator"", and the intention of the expansion was to rival to Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast and Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal expansions. Oster said that Siege of Dragonspear is bigger than the two previous expansions combined, taking the player occupied for at least 25 hours of play across 70 new areas and that introduces a new monster summoning class called ""The Shaman"", and adds 4 new companions to complement the original roster of characters that can be imported from Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.[2][3][4] In addition, Oster said that there are several improvements to the UI including the addition of health bars and journal pop-up entries.[5]
Oster admitted that recovering all original voice actors, to reprise their original roles, was not simple since some of them left the industry, but Ginny McSwain, the voice director for the original Baldur's Gate, managed to recreate a performance as faithful as possible working with them.[4] Since the fact that the Forgotten Realms of Baldur's Gate belongs to the 2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, they were a very different place to that of the most recent edition, so game writers Amber Scott and Andrew Foley did a very complicated job to make sure that the plot of Siege of Dragonspear matches the canon of second edition.[4]
Skybound Games, a division of Skybound Entertainment, released the game to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on October 15, 2019.[6][7]
Siege of Dragonspear was released on March 31, 2016, and received mixed reviews.[8] Hayden Dingman of PC World was generally positive to the game, praising the gameplay and updated visuals, but was critical to combat system.[12] Jason Wilson of VentureBeat's GamesBeat appreciated the will of Beamdog to do more than just re-releasing enhanced version of great classics, and liked to return to the Forgotten Realms to see the long-unforeseen events between Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.[11]
More stringent were Destructoid and PC Gamer's opinions on Siege of Dragonspear. Patrick Hancock, of Destructoid, defined the game to be ""fun as an experience"" although ""there could be some hard-to-ignore faults"".[10] Phil Savage of PC Gamer, wrote that ""Beamdog has proven they can continue the Baldur's Gate story"" but defined their work as a mere replication of ""the antiquated nature of the Baldur's Gate games"".[9]
GameStar offers a more negative opinion, strongly criticising the writing of the main story by pointing out plot holes, illogical changes to the recurring characters from the first Baldur's Gate and a ""bizarre soap opera ending"". The publication also took issue with the graphical changes which make the game look ""cartoony"" as well as numerous bugs and crashes occurring during the review.[13]
Parts of the game's writing attracted some negative initial reviews on Steam and GOG.com, with Eurogamer's Robert Purchese reporting that criticism focused on two scenes. The first is the character Minsc's quip, ""Really, it's about ethics in heroic adventuring"", a reference to the Gamergate controversy. The second is an optional dialogue tree in which the cleric Mizhena mentions that she was raised as a boy, indicating that she is a trans woman.[14] Colin Campbell of Polygon reported that writer Amber Scott faced online harassment and insults, and that the game's Steam and GOG.com pages were bombarded with complaints that the transgender reference constituted ""political correctness"", ""LGBT tokenism"" and ""SJW pandering"".[15] Scott said that she wanted to address elements in the original Baldur's Gate that she considered sexist, including its depictions of Safana as a ""sex object"" and Jaheira as a ""nagging wife"" played for comedy.[16] She had previously commented: ""I get to make decisions about who I write about and why. I don't like writing about straight/white/cis people all the time. It's not reflective of the real world, it sets up s/w/c as the 'normal' baseline from which 'other' characters must be added, and it's boring"".[17]
Five days after the expansion's release, Jeff Grubb of VentureBeat reported that 142 people had posted negative user reviews on Metacritic, the vast majority giving a score of ""zero"", and suggested that a mob of gamers were attempting to review bomb the expansion for adding diversity.[18] Ed Greenwood, creator of the Forgotten Realms game world in which the Baldur's Gate series takes place, defended the inclusion of a transgender character.[15] Trent Oster also defended this decision.[19]
On an April 2016 post discussing both technical and content issues, Beamdog revealed that they will remove the Gamergate joke and expand Mizhena's story.[20] To this effect, the 2.5 patch added a new quest, given by Mizhena; the dialogue tree where Mizhena indicate being a trans woman is now after the player has completed the quest, rather than the first time the player meets Mizhena.[21] Paul Tumburro of CraveOnline termed this as ""spineless and disappointing"" stating that Beamdog's founder Trent Oster refused to acknowledge the transphobic criticisms leveled at the game.[22]

Game Informer (GI)[a] is an American monthly video game magazine featuring articles, news, strategy, and reviews of video games and game consoles. It debuted in August 1991, when the video game retailer FuncoLand started publishing an in-house newsletter.[3][4] It was acquired by the retailer GameStop, which bought FuncoLand in 2000. Due to this, a large amount of promotion was done in-store, which contributed to the success of the magazine. As of June 2017, it was the fifth-most popular magazine by copies circulated.
In August 2024, GameStop discontinued Game Informer after 33 years of publication and 368 issues.[5][1][6] The associated website was also shut down with its digital archive removed.[7][8] In March 2025, Game Informer announced that it had been acquired by Gunzilla Games and established as its own business. The relaunch included a revival of the magazine's website, the restoration of the digital archive, and brought back all of Game Informer's laid off staff. Game Informer also restarted the publication of the print magazine in June 2025.
Game Informer debuted in August 1991.[9][1][10] David R. Pomijie, owner of FuncoLand, decided to launch a magazine as a better way to spend ""advertising dollars"".[11] The first editor-in-chief (EIC) was Elizabeth Olson with Andy McNamara as her editorial assistant.[11] In 1993, Olson and McNamara jointly became coeditors-in-chief;[11] with the release of issue sixteen, McNamara became the sole EIC.[11][10] Game Informer was published every two months until November 1994, when the magazine began to be released monthly.[9][10]
In 2000, Barnes & Noble acquired and merged several companies which led to the formation of GameStop Corp.; that year, both FuncoLand and Game Informer were purchased by GameStop.[11] In 2001, Cathy Preston became the magazine's publisher; Preston had been working as part of the production team since 2000.[11][12] It was under her that the publication became an integral part of GameStop's customer loyalty program, Power Up Rewards.[11][13] In 2019, McNamara was still the magazine's EIC.[11] In 2020, Preston retired from Game Informer after 20 years.[14] Mary Lugones took over the role as publisher for Game Informer.[citation needed]
In 2010, Game Informer became the 5th largest magazine in the US with 5 million copies sold, ahead of popular publications like Time, Sports Illustrated, and Playboy.[15] By 2011, Game Informer had become the 3rd largest magazine in the US, topping 8 million copies circulated.[16] However, in 2014 it had fallen to 4th place with 6.9 million copies sold.[17] Figures in 2017 placed the magazine at 4th place with over 7 million copies sold.[18] The financial success of Game Informer has been attributed to its good relationship with publishers, ties to GameStop, and the lack of gaming-magazine competition.[15]
In August 2019, after months of declining financials for GameStop, about half of the current Game Informer staff were let go, part of the larger cut of more than 120 jobs by GameStop as part of the store's effort to improve their financial performance. These included some staff members that had been working at Game Informer for over 10 years, some were out on vacation during the time of the layoff. As a result of the layoff, other Game Informer staff also left of their own will, including video editor Ben Hanson. Ben Hanson eventually started his own podcast called MinnMax, in the process recruiting some of the Game Informer staff that was laid off.[19] In March 2020, there was again another set of layoffs at Game Informer, this time not affecting editors but instead people who worked in other departments of Game Informer.[20][14]
In late June 2020, longtime EIC McNamara announced he was leaving Game Informer, to be the Global Director of Integrated Comms for Shooters & Star Wars at Electronic Arts, and that former senior editor Andrew Reiner would be taking his place as EIC. McNamara, who had at the time stopped reviewing games for Game Informer, instead focused solely on writing stories and behind the scenes work, came back to give his final review, The Last of Us Part II. After leaving Game Informer, he eventually said that the layoffs had a big impact on his decision to move on.[10]
On November 4, 2021, the official website announced that every issue from then on would have a small print run variant known as Game Informer Gold. This version uses high quality paper and an alternate cover and is limited to 50 copies. The first copy was given away on November 6 for their Extra Life charity livestream.[21]
In July 2022, three more Game Informer staff were laid off: John Carson, Wesley LeBlanc, and Creative Director Jeff Akervik, who had worked at the publication for over 14 years.[22] Later that month, LeBlanc was rehired after the departure of Jill Grodt.[23][24] Andrew Reiner left Game Informer in September 2022 to become a game developer, thus leaving Game Informer with no original staff. Matt Miller, who has worked at Game Informer since 2004, was promoted to EIC. In Fall 2022, Kyle Hilliard (who was previously laid off) returned.[25]
Game Informer launched a new print magazine subscription, standalone from GameStop's Power Up Rewards, in March 2024. The program, which launched at a special annual price of $19.91 (commemorating the company's founding year), offers 10 print issues per year and digital magazine access.[26]
On August 2, 2024, GameStop leadership abruptly shuttered the publication and laid off its staff. The publication's website was replaced with a static ""farewell"" page, making old articles unreadable. The July 2024 issue was its 368th and final issue.[1][6][7] Current and former staff bemoaned the sudden closure.[27] Morgan Park of PC Gamer reported that GameStop announced the shutdown publicly on the Game Informer X account, however, the ""Game Informer staff suggested they had nothing to do with the brief, cringey statement that reads like ChatGPT output"".[7] Park highlighted that the Game Informer X account went briefly active on August 5, 2024 when ""a former Game Informer staffer seemingly took the reins one last time to share a proper farewell"" which included images of the Game Informer masthead; after this farewell was posted, the Game Informer X account was wiped and ""no longer exists, just like the website. It seems GameStop didn't appreciate Game Informer wanting to go out on its own terms"".[7] Aftermath then published a roundup from former Game Informer staff to eulogize the magazine in their own words.[28]
Game Informer Online was originally launched in August 1996 and featured daily news updates as well as articles. Justin Leeper and Matthew Kato were hired on in November 1999 as full-time web editors. As part of the GameStop purchase of the magazine, this original GameInformer.com site was closed around January 2001.[29]
GI Online was revived, at the same domain name, in September 2003, with a full redesign and many additional features, such as a review database, frequent news updates, and exclusive ""Unlimited"" content for subscribers. It was managed by Billy Berghammer, creator of PlanetGameCube.com (now known as NintendoWorldReport.com).[30] In 2010, Berghammer was the editor-in-chief at EGM Media Group.[31]
In March 2009, the online staff began creating the code for what would be the latest redesign to date. The redesign was to release hand-in-hand with the magazine's own redesign. On October 1, 2009, the newly redesigned website was live, with a welcome message from Editor-In-Chief Andy McNamara. Many new features were introduced, including a rebuilt media player, a feed highlighting the site activity of the website's users, and the ability to create user reviews.[32] At the same time, the magazine's podcast, The Game Informer Show, was launched.[33]
When the magazine folded in 2024, the website's content was deleted and replaced with a splash page announcing the closure for any links to the website.[6][7][8] Aftermath reported that there are independent archival projects ""in the works"".[28]
In November 2009, Game Informer was launched in Australia by former Australian GamePro, Gameplayer and Official PlayStation Magazine editor Chris Stead and publisher Citrus Media.[34] By June 2010, Game Informer Australia had become the first local games publication to pass 10,000 subscribers. By August 18, 2010, it had become Australia's biggest-selling video games publication.[35]
Game Informer Australia was closed down on April 18, 2019, as a result of cost-cutting measures from its publishing company EB Games Australia.[36] GI Australia editor David Milner noted on Twitter that despite the fact that ""readership was up 19% over the last year"", that ""Recent ad sales, however, did not really reflect this""; he also noted the failed attempt at EB Games Australia's corporate parent GameStop to find a buyer after months on the market, causing their shares to drop.[37]
On March 19, 2025, Game Informer shared a short video on its social media channels ""featuring the publication's farewell message""; this video included code, resembling an arcade game, at the bottom of the screen with the word ""Continue"" and ended with the date March 25 flashed, ""suggesting a launch or announcement"".[38] Former Game Informer staff also shared this video,[39] with former director Brian Shea stating he could not ""comment at this time but encouraged checking out the social media posts of his former colleagues"".[38] Then on March 25, 2025, Game Informer announced that Gunzilla Games, developers of Off the Grid, had purchased Game Informer and hired back the staff that had been laid off at its initial shutdown. They relaunched the website and digital archive with new articles and reviews for games that released during their initial shutdown.[40][41] In June 2025, they also restarted the publication of the print magazine.[42]
Game Informer reviewed games since the early 16-bit era. The magazine has reviewed games on PCs, consoles (including PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation VR, Xbox Series X, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch) and mobile devices running Android and iOS.[43] Game Informer used to give separate reviews of the same game for each console for which that game was released; starting in the mid-2000s, GI has published just one consolidated review for the game, while provides notes on the pros and cons of each version. Older games, three per issue, were given brief reviews in the magazine's ""Classic GI"" section (compared with the game's original review score, if one exists). This was discontinued in 2009, months before the redesign of the magazine.[citation needed] The magazine's staff members rate games on a scale of 1 to 10 with quarter-point intervals. A score of 1 to 5 is considered terrible (in many issues, 1 is noted as a joke reason for the score, for instance, ""Duplicates in lootboxes"" in issue 295);[44] 6 to 7 is ""average"", a decently playable, and sometimes fun (but flawed) game; and 10 is a rare, ""outstanding"", nearly perfect game.[45]
Annually, Game Informer's editors counted and judged the ""Top 50 Games of [last year]"". The games were sorted in order of release date. They do not have rankings, but they did commemorate special games with awards like Game of the Year and other examples. They also had top ten charts of differing categories, both in the ""Top 50"" section of the website and in the regular magazine.[citation needed] Game Informer also annually included an ""E3 Hot 50"", a special section that reviews the year's E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) and most to all of its games, which also temporarily replaced the ""Previews"" section of the print edition.[citation needed]
The April edition of Game Informer includes 'an annual feature Game Infarcer, an April Fools' Day prank. In the cover box head appears ""World's #1 Pretend Magazine"" where would ordinarily appear ""World's #1 Video Game Magazine"" -- ""Parody"" is found at the cover bottom. Game Infarcer articles are accredited to the fictional editor-in-chief Darth Clark, who is addressed in hate mail every year sent to Game Informer. The heated responses to parody articles are often featured in later Game Informer issues.[59][60]
Game Informer has included four ""Sacred Cow Barbecues"".[61] Similar in style to a celebrity roast, the occasion is meant to ""knock some of gaming's most revered icons off their high and mighty pedestals"".[62] The first Sacred Cow Barbecues  featured in issue 158 (June 2006).[63] Other issues featuring Sacred Cow Barbecues are: 183 (July 2008),[62] 211 (November 2010),[64] and 261 (January 2015).[65] Sacred Cow Barbecues articles are considered controversial among those gamers who are not amused by their favorite games being mocked.[65]
