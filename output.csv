Baldur's Gate 3 (also known as BG3 and Baldur's Gate III) is a 2023 role-playing video game by Larian Studios. It is the third installment in the Baldur's Gate series. The game's full release for Windows happened in August, with PlayStation 5, macOS, and Xbox Series X/S later in the same year. In the game's narrative, the party seeks to cure themselves of a parasitic tadpole infecting their brain. It can be played alone or in a group.    
Adapted from the fifth edition of tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, Baldur's Gate 3 takes its mechanics and setting, the Forgotten Realms, from the tabletop game. Players create a highly customisable character and embark on quests with a party of voiced companions. Alternatively, they can play as a companion instead. The gameplay comprises real-time exploration of large areas, turn-based combat, and narrative choices which impact the party and the wider world. Outcomes for combat, dialogue and world interaction are generally determined by rolling a 20-sided die.  
Baldur's Gate (1998) and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (2000) were developed by BioWare. A third game, subtitled The Black Hound and developed by Black Isle, was cancelled in 2003 following a licensing dispute. Dungeons and Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast (WotC) declined Larian's first pitch to make the game following the release of Divinity: Original Sin (2014). Impressed by pre-release material for Divinity: Original Sin II (2017), WotC welcomed a new pitch and eventually greenlit Larian's development. The company grew considerably in the six-year production. In August 2020, Larian released the game's first act in early access, providing them with player feedback and revenue. After the full release, Larian added free new content to the game until the final patch in April 2025. 
Baldur's Gate 3 received critical acclaim and had record-breaking awards success, with praise directed at its cinematic visuals, writing, production quality, and performances. It became the first title to win Game of the Year at all five major video game awards ceremonies and received the same accolade from several publications. It was financially successful, generating significant profit for both Larian Studios and WotC's parent company Hasbro.  It has been regarded as one of the greatest video games ever made.
Baldur's Gate 3 is a role-playing game,[7] and can be played in single-player or multiplayer.[b] It has a free-floating camera, with players able to adjust the perspective from top-down isometric to third person.[10] Based on the fifth edition rules of the tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D 5e),[7] several mechanics are identical between the two.[11][c] A major feature is that outcomes are decided by rolling a twenty-sided die (d20).[13][d] Some rolls occur with ""advantage"" or ""disadvantage"", meaning two d20s are rolled and the player receives the best or worst result, respectively.[15] The game includes support for modding, but using them disables achievements.[16]
In character creation, the player selects a class,[e] species,[f] and backstory.[g][22] If the selected class uses magic, they will also choose their starting spells.[18] Characters level up by collecting experience points by several means—examples include exploration, combat, and solving puzzles. Levelling up provides access to new class features.[23] The maximum player level of Baldur's Gate 3 is level 12; in the tabletop game, the limit is level 20.[24][12] Available at certain level intervals are feats.[25] These diversify or specialise a character's style of play.[26] With each feat, players choose a new ability or increase their stats,[25] which are called abilities.[h][27] After levelling up, players can also choose to place a level into a different class, known as multiclassing.[i]
The game is divided into three acts,[28] with a large, explorable location tied to each.[29] In non-combat scenarios, the game is primarily experienced in real time.[27][j] There are 288 quests,[31]: 1:23  with significant creative freedom as to how they are completed,[28] some being mutually exclusive, and some unfolding across multiple arcs.[32] Companions have their own side quests, but the game can be completed without companion presence.[33] Almost any character can die,[34] including those integral to the narrative,[28] and all speaking characters are fully voiced.[35] Using a spell or potion, players can speak to any encountered animal,[36] and a more limited number of corpses.[37]
Players can set up a camp as a way to rest from the adventure and talk with companions.[38] There are 17 unique camp locations, contextually dependent on where in the game world the camp is set up.[39] A non-player character based at camp, Withers, allows players to respec.[40] Limited resources—for example, hit points and spell slots—are replenished by resting. There are two types of rest: long and short. A short rest restores 50% of the characters' maximum hit points alongside some class-specific features. Players can short rest twice before they must long rest to replenish them. Long rests teleport players back to camp and fully replenish resources.[40]
Players select items in the world, such as chests, to interact with them.[27] Items, like explosive barrels, can be sent to a camp stash and retrieved later.[41] Picking locks, disarming traps, and exploring locations grant experience.[23] If the player attempts to pick a lock, the game rolls a dice; the result is compared against the value required to open the lock. A character's skills or abilities can add to the rolled value, making it easier.[13]
The game's combat systems are modelled on D&D 5e.[27] Entering combat switches the game to turn-based mode.[27] A d20 roll, called an initiative roll, determines the order in which each character acts.[k] In a turn, each character has limited resources.[43] The primary resources are actions, bonus actions, and movement.[43] Major instructions to a character, like attacking with a sword or casting a spell, consume an action. Smaller commands, like jumping or drinking a potion,[l] consume a bonus action.[45] Characters can also move a set distance. When the player has finished the available actions for a character, their turn ends; combat is finished when all enemies are defeated.[43] The player can also have controlled characters leave combat by moving sufficiently far from enemies. The outcomes of player actions—for example, whether an attack hits and how much damage it deals—are primarily determined through dice rolls.[43][45]
When a character attacks, the game rolls a d20—this is called an attack roll.[43] The result is compared against the target's armour class; if the roll value is lower than the armour class, the attack misses.[46] Players can see the percentage-chance that an attack will hit before making it; this value is impacted by things like terrain.[43] Some attacks have damage types. These can amplify one another (e.g., applying grease and fire to a target will make them burn for multiple turns) or counteract the other's effect (e.g., shooting a fire arrow at an enemy standing in ice will melt the ice, leaving a water surface).[47] Environmental elements like explosive barrels can be exploited,[43] and weapons can be dipped in poison.[47]
Conversations are another area of gameplay in Baldur's Gate 3. Some conversations include skill checks, wherein the player rolls a d20, with the result affecting the outcome. Players can initiate combat by selecting an aggressive dialogue option,[48] or use dialogue to avoid combat entirely.[49] This is a major feature of the charisma-focused bard class.[48] Dialogue options can involve persuasion, intimidation, and deception.[50]
Player characters can initiate romance or sexual relationships with many non-player characters.[51] Actions and dialogue options affect relationship outcomes.[52] Characters that can be romanced are ""playersexual"", meaning the player character's gender does not impact romance availability.[53][51] The game has thirteen romance options.[52]
Baldur's Gate 3 shares its Dungeons and Dragons setting, called the Forgotten Realms, with previous games in the franchise. BG3 and its predecessors take place on the continent of Faerûn, primarily near or inside the namesake city of Baldur's Gate. BG3 occurs over 100 years after the events of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (2000) and shortly after the events of the D&D tie-in adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus (2019).[54] The game features monsters from the Forgotten Realms, including owlbears,[55] gnolls,[56] and mind flayers.[28]
The game's first act has no designated tutorial, but certain resources and encounters throughout the act are deliberately constructed to guide the player.[57] The act is primarily set around a mind flayer ship wreckage.[58] Players have access to several locations, including a druids' grove, goblin camp, and a monastery set against a mountain pass.[29] Writer Ali Jones characterises the first act as ""fairytale backdrop"", and IGN's Leana Hafer said it was ""mostly idyllic wilderness"".[59] Eight of the game's ten companions are introduced in act one, with six recruitable near the start.[60] The Underdark is a large subterranean area accessible through multiple locations; each entrance leads to unique environments.[58] Act one ends when players traverse the mountain pass or Underdark to reach act two's setting.[61] In act two, players traverse the Shadow Cursed lands to reach Moonrise Towers,[29] an oppressive and dark environment.[59][62][63] Only one companion is introduced in act two.[60] Locations explored include the Last Light Inn[59] and the Gauntlet of Shar.[64] The third and final act is primarily set in the dense city environment of Baldur's Gate,[29] but with some areas accessible outside of the city, like a visiting circus and the shoreline.[65] The city is the location of the tenth and final recruitable companion.[60]
The world, alongside the player's thoughts and observations, are recounted by the game's narrator (Amelia Tyler), acting as BG3's dungeon master. While the narrator was originally planned to deliver lines contemptuously, Larian was impressed by Tyler's deadpan delivery.[66] Of the ten companions, six can be chosen as the player character in the character creator. Known as origin characters, they have a pre-set character class, race, and appearance. Although their classes can be changed, origin character personalities and backstories are sometimes related to them.[67]
The seventh origin character, the Dark Urge, cannot be recruited.[n] The Dark Urge narrative is linked closely with the main narrative. In this origin, the player is compulsively evil and can choose to resist or indulge these desires.[85]
There are four non-origin characters who can be recruited:
The game's overarching villain is the Absolute, voiced by prolific voice actress Cissy Jones, who controls the mind flayers.[91] Three other antagonists control the elder brain—Ketheric Thorm, Enver Gortash, and Orin the Red.[92] Actor J. K. Simmons portrays Ketheric Thorm,[93] a tragic villain planned as recruitable in early development.[94] Jason Isaacs and Maggie Robertson portray Enver Gortash and Orin the Red, respectively.[95][96] The Emperor is a mind flayer detached from the species' hive mind. A controversial, complex character,[97] and a player romance option, he was voiced by Scott Joseph.[98] Raphael, a devil, is a supporting villain encountered early who offers the player a deal to remove the parasite in their head.[99][100] Voice actor Andrew Wincott portrays Raphael as a theatrical villain influenced by Shakespeare's Iago.[101]
The protagonist wakes up inside a giant dimension-crossing illithid (mind flayer) flying ship. They are infected with a parasitic tadpole that enthralls and transforms people into illithids; however, the transformation does not happen, and the ship comes under attack from githyanki warriors riding red dragons. The mind flayer crew teleports the ship to the Nine Hells and are attacked by an army of Devils. The protagonist is freed during the fighting and steers the damaged ship to Faerûn, where it crashes. They encounter other survivors of the wreck, all likewise implanted with tadpoles.
The party seeks to remove their parasites through numerous avenues, all of which fail to provide a cure. They are saved from the tadpoles' overwhelming psychic force by a ""Dream Visitor"" inside Shadowheart's mysterious prism, a device that is sought after by the githyanki. The protagonist then becomes involved in the fate of the Emerald Grove, where local druids and tiefling refugees face off against the goblin horde that worships a cult of the ""Absolute"". Once the party either sacks or saves the grove, they travel through the mountains or the Underdark to reach Moonrise Towers, a cultist stronghold, in search of a new cure.
The protagonist seeks sanctuary from the curse around Moonrise Towers in a tavern called the Last Light, held by a group of tiefling refugees, Flaming Fist conscripts, and Harpers. General Ketheric Thorm, the reigning lord of Moonrise and Chosen of Myrkul, is using a relic named the ""Nightsong"" as an engine for his immortality. The party scours the Gauntlet of Shar, a deserted temple to the goddess of darkness and loss, in pursuit of the Nightsong, revealed to be Dame Aylin, a daughter of Selûne, the goddess of the moon and Shar's sister. After either slaying or freeing the Nightsong, the protagonist confronts Ketheric, as well as his cohorts—Orin the Red (the Chosen of Bhaal) and Enver Gortash (the Chosen of Bane). Through their Netherstones and a mysterious crown, the triumvirate collectively controls the Absolute (revealed to be an Elder Brain, the ultimate form of the illithid race) and seeks to rule the Sword Coast by manipulating everyone infected with a tadpole. Orin and Gortash depart with the Elder Brain for Baldur's Gate, while the protagonist defeats Ketheric and claims his Netherstone.
The protagonist arrives at Baldur's Gate as Gortash and Orin attempt to pit them against the other, while the companions find closure for their personal quests. It is revealed that the ""Dream Visitor"" is, in fact, a visage taken by a renegade illithid called the Emperor, who resides within the prism and oversees the imprisonment of a powerful githyanki, Orpheus. Orpheus is the source of psionic resistance the party possesses against the Absolute, and the Emperor has been leveraging this in his favour. The protagonist eventually faces off against Gortash and Orin, assembling the Netherstones to subdue the Elder Brain. The Elder Brain, having anticipated the triumvirate and the protagonist's every move, overpowers the party before the Emperor comes to the rescue.
Realizing that the Netherstones require an illithid wielder with Orpheus' powers to be effective, the protagonist either frees Orpheus and allows him to transform, which causes the Emperor to resign to his fate and join the Absolute, or has either the Emperor, a transformed Karlach, or the player character consume Orpheus in order to see the mission through. After defeating the Elder Brain, the protagonist can choose to either kill it and every illithid tadpole with it, ending the threat forever, or betray their comrades and rule as the Absolute.
The Baldur's Gate series began development in 1995 when Wizards of the Coast's predecessor, TSR, Inc., asked publisher Interplay Entertainment to produce a video game using the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) property. BioWare agreed to develop the title, having formed a partnership with Interplay for Shattered Steel (1996). Initially titled Iron Throne, the game was retitled Baldur's Gate (1998) at the suggestion of Interplay co-founder Brian Fargo.[102] Created by a largely inexperienced group of developers,[103]: 1  BioWare delivered the game a year behind Interplay's schedule and achieved commercial success, leading to an expansion in 1999.[102][o] A direct sequel followed, Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (2000), using the second edition of D&D for its rule set,[104] and was also published by Interplay and Black Isle Studios.[103]: 3  The first two Baldur's Gate games provided pre-scripted, branching narratives. BioWare's third game with the D&D property, Neverwinter Nights (2002), used D&D's third edition,[104] and facilitated a gameplay experience closer to the tabletop game by emphasising multiplayer and allowing players to control non-player characters.[106][p] Following a licensing issue, another Dungeons and Dragons video game, The Black Hound, was designated as the third game in the Baldur's Gate series; it was cancelled when Interplay lost the rights to release Baldur's Gate titles on PC.[105]
Several companies sought the rights to make the title over the following decade. Interplay's Brian Fargo described interest from Obsidian Entertainment's CEO Feargus Urquhart, Larian Studios' CEO Swen Vincke, and Fargo himself.[108] Canadian developer Beamdog made enhanced editions of the first and second games, followed by Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear (2016), a large expansion using the Infinity Engine.[109] Cameron Tofer, co-founder of Beamdog, said making the third game was the studio's ""long-term goal"".[110]
Vincke first approached Wizards of the Coast (WotC) about making the game during Larian's development of Divinity: Original Sin (2014), but WotC declined, citing their inexperience.[q] Shortly before the release of the sequel, Divinity: Original Sin II (2017), WotC were intrigued by pre-release footage and asked Larian for a pitch for Baldur's Gate 3. Vincke created a design document around a month before the release of Original Sin II in a hotel room with several designers and writers.[112] The pitch was scheduled for the release day of Original Sin II, leading to a short turnaround time. WotC did not like the pitch, but granted Larian's request for more time.[113][80] WotC had a new chief executive officer at this time and Vincke met him on one of his first days. Larian had to meet several milestones, including an approved design document.[114]: 5:52  A later pitch was received positively and WotC granted Larian the licence.[80][112] In an October 2019 Twitter post, Fargo said he knew who was developing Baldur's Gate 3.[115]
Larian wanted to produce a game with triple-A production values, budget, and marketing;  they viewed Baldur's Gate, alongside Fallout and Ultima, as an intellectual property capable of enabling that.[116] Larian built new cinematic functionality into their game engine, viewing these capabilities as key to accessibility. The studio's cinematic ambitions came with challenges,[7] requiring the studio grow considerably.[117] Close-up dialogue scenes required new teams responsible for cinematics quality assurance and lighting. The size of the art and audio teams increased because the technical requirements differed from those of Original Sin II. Clothing designs and textures, for example, had to work from close and far perspectives because of the cinematic camera.[117][3] Baldur's Gate 3 uses technology from the eighth generation of video game consoles, like screen-spaced reflections and shadow maps for lighting and shadow.[118]
The studio's size increased from around 140 employees in 2017 to over 450 in 2023, making it one of the world's largest privately owned video game companies.[117] Industry journalist Jason Schreier described Larian Studios as a ""unicorn"": large enough to make triple-A games but not subject to the mechanics mandated by publicly traded publishers, like microtransactions and battle passes, that ""maximize revenue"" and ""minimize risk"".[119]
In part due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Baldur's Gate 3 had an unusually long 6-year development cycle.[117] Larian closed its Saint Petersburg office following the invasion. Anticipating military enlistment for staff, they liaised with embassies and consulates to support relocation efforts, with 90% of employees based in Saint Petersburg moving office. The game's complex code base meant the effects of closing the office were felt throughout development.[120]
Vincke described Baldur's Gate 3 as Larian's ""Covid game"",[121] with the pandemic reducing productivity, causing communication issues internally and with external partners, and preventing performance motion capture.[122] The studio lost staff over the 6-year development period,[121] including cinematics lead Jim Southworth, who died shortly after the game's release.[123] The credits bear a dedication to Southworth.[2]
Dungeons and Dragons creative director Mike Mearls said the team welcomed Larian changes to D&D lore, hoping changes would tie into increased player agency.[124] Mearls said that collaborating with Larian felt like a natural extension of Wizards of the Coast's D&D team, with both companies anticipating required adjustments to fifth-edition rules.[125] Vincke suggested using mind flayers as antagonists after seeing an illustration in Volo's Guide to Monsters.[7] Writer Adam Smith said WotC had not documented the process of transforming into one, so Larian produced a 7-day timeline,[4] inspired by body horror and the films of David Cronenberg.[126] Baldur's Gate 3 is set over 100 years after the first two entries; Smith said WotC had ""filled out"" the intervening century because the area was integral to the Forgotten Realms and Sword Coast settings.[127] Larian collaborated with WotC on a precursor module for the game,[127] Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus (2019). The module provided information on events occurring since Baldur's Gate II.[124]
Larian had two London-based studios working on motion capture. Vincke estimated this spanned 1.5 million words of dialogue in 2020;[7] in 2024, Vincke estimated 1.3 million lines and over 140 hours of cutscenes.[128][r] In development, the multiplayer mode allowed players to role play with their partner, but the feature was removed because of the added complexity.[130] All 248 of the game's voice actors performed the motion capture for their characters.[131] There are over 170 ending variations,[117][s] which required substantial testing,[5]: 16:27  and Larian's writers worked on ending dialogue and descriptions for over a year.[77] Larian encouraged the main cast to interact with fans, which Devora Wilde, who portrays Lae'zel, said was unusual in the industry.[80]
Smith described the team's approach as ""reactive"", saying that identifying frequent player choices informed their writing decisions.[127] Some characters were changed substantially throughout development. Larian reduced the hostility of companions to the player character, including Shadowheart and Lae'zel.[77] Karlach's infernal heart was a late addition to the game.[77] According to region producer Elena Statsenko, Larian aimed to incorporate moral dilemmas and outcome variety for different player types into quests.[31]: 1:23  Other design considerations included integration with the main story and adjustments if the player controlled an origin character.[31]: 5:29 
Larian Studios revealed Baldur's Gate 3 with a trailer at a conference for Google's cloud gaming platform, Stadia, in July 2019.[113] Vincke said letting potential customers play without installing the game had ""great conversion power"", but stated the title would not be exclusive to Stadia.[133] Following Google's discontinuation of Stadia in 2023, Vincke expressed regret, describing it as ""a really stupid deal"", but said the funds provided by the deal had funded the game's visuals.[134]
Larian partially released an unfinished version of the game's first act into early access in October 2020. The early access had over 2.5 million players[117] with the resulting revenue sustaining the studio.[135] The game's scope increased throughout this period.[117] Some companions were not recruitable in the early access,[77] and it contained many bugs.[80] Other changes included new character classes and subclasses, user interface updates and game balancing.[136][137] Eurogamer's Ruth Cassidy said that the changes to characterisation before the full release, such as decreasing hostility to the player and increasing their vulnerability, felt like fan service.[138] Continuous rewriting of the script required voice actors to return to the studio.[80]
During early access the game's Steam user reviews dropped below 75%, which Vincke characterised as a ""disaster"".[139] IGN, PC Gamer and GameSpot's reviewers said it was fun but that bugs meant waiting for the full release would be advantageous,[140][141][142] with David Wildgoose describing the game as ""rough"", ""messy"", and ""just barely hanging together"".[142] Ars Technica and Siliconera's reviews said the early access provided an overall disappointing experience.[143][144]
Larian experienced issues while developing a version for Xbox Series X and Series S.[145] Performance variation between the two consoles in split-screen co-operative play was an issue because feature parity was a requirement of the Xbox platform.[146]  Following an in-person meeting with Microsoft Games executive Phil Spencer at Gamescom, Vincke and Spencer arranged a compromise where the game could be brought to Xbox consoles without split-screen play on the Xbox Series S.[147]
In March 2023, Larian Studios staff were concerned that the game would be delayed to avoid competition from another title, Bethesda Softworks' Starfield, after the lengthy development cycle. Vincke accelerated the game's Windows release by four weeks,[117] and delayed the PlayStation 5 version by one week.[148] The game was released for Windows on 3 August 2023,[55] PlayStation 5 on 6 September 2023,[149] and macOS on 22 September 2023.[150] Following the PlayStation 5 version's launch, Larian revealed an animated short, ""The Launch Party"", co-produced with UK-based animation studio Mashed.[151] On 7 December 2023, directly following The Game Awards 2023, Larian released Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series X and Series S.[152]
After release, Larian Studios provided new content and improvements via patching, with release dates sometimes varying by platform.[153] Released for PC in August 2023, the first patch added over 1,000 bug fixes and balance changes, alongside increased polish for animations.[154] The September 2023 update permitted players to customise their appearance,[155] support for modding, and increased the number of endings for evil playthroughs.[156] A November 2023 patch added customisation for player characters and hirelings; increased the frequency of autosaving; and new idle animations.[157] In December 2023, the developer added two difficulty modes and an expanded epilogue featuring over 3,500 new lines of dialogue.[158] An eighth and final patch was released in April 2025. The patch introduced 12 new sub-classes, a photo mode, cross-platform play,[159] and co-operative split-screen for Xbox Series S.[160] Jasmine Gould-Wilson regretted that GamesRadar+ could not name BG3 as their 2024 game of the year despite extensive changes to the changes.[161]
The developer was widely criticised for not providing full credits for localisation teams involved in the game. Vincke blamed the error on Larian's localisation provider, Altagram, and promised a fix.[162] Altagram published an apology.[163]
Larian released a physical edition of the game but the disc did not contain the full game, instead providing a downloader for it. The game's full soundtrack was distributed across three discs, and it featured a cloth-printed map, stickers, and a chalk-paper mind flayer poster.[164]
According to review aggregator website Metacritic, Baldur's Gate 3 received ""universal acclaim"" from critics,[165][166][167] with 98% of critics recommending the game on aggregator OpenCritic.[168] Critics praised the game's detail and scope, with several comparing the studio to a gracious dungeon master,[22][28][176][55][18][174] and describing the game as faithfully emulating the tabletop Dungeons and Dragons experience.[151][55][118] The Guardian's Nick Rueben said the game enabled players to solve problems creatively.[22] Several reviews praised the game's production quality, citing the cinematics, performance capture, and fully voiced cast.[55][169][34] Polygon's Gita Jackson described the game as a ""masterpiece"" with limits imposed by a flawed tabletop predecessor.[173]
The writing received wide praise.[55][169][28] IGN's Leana Hafer said the side quests were ""strong"",[55] with Allen Van Aken praising quest outcome variety;[169] Dekker said the game rightly prioritised player freedom over satisfying quest resolution.[28] Eurogamer's Ruth Cassidy criticised the main narrative as having false urgency.[138] Windows Central's Jennifer Young said narrative decisions had weight because almost every character could die.[34] PCMag's reviewers criticised that some choices could inadvertently prevent players accessing some plot lines.[18] The Dark Urge character origin received dedicated coverage.[177][178][179]
Several reviews praised the characters as elevating the narrative above standard fantasy tropes and archetypes.[169][28] Andrew Zucosky, the reviewer for Digital Trends, said the companions' stories were his main motivation for playing.[35] Ali Jones said companion's personalities contrasted well with their character classes—for example, Shadowheart as a healer ""[serving] a goddess of darkness and loss"" and Karlach as a traumatised barbarian ""determined to draw on joy"".[180] Jackson praised the companion's reactivity, highlighting the vampire spawn Astarion's embrace of his freedom.[173] Eurogamer's Ruth Cassidy criticised the rushed initiation of romance arcs,[138] while PCMag's reviewers praised them for developing naturally and being ""unabashedly sexual"".[18] Hafer and Jones praised the romance overall,[55] with Jones describing the approach as more ""mature"" than ""picking the right dialogue options"".[180] A month after launch, Vincke explained that a bug had made companions ""so horny"".[181]
Some reviewers praised BG3's combat, citing the range of options,[171][63][172][138] reactivity,[28][182][18] and approaches enabling combat avoidance.[172][34][171] Eric Van Allen of Destructoid said combat ""ranges from interesting to overwhelming"".[182] Cassidy praised the game for encouraging positional strategy and preparation.[138] Two critics suggested that the game's complexity would be divisive.[183][174] Some reviewers described combat as tedious.[173][34] Polygon's Maddy Myers criticised some elements as unintuitive, citing how weapons are dipped in poison by interacting with them as if they are a health potion instead of the ""dip weapon"" function.[47] Jackson said she saved before every combat encounter because random outcomes often had devastating, uncontrollable consequences.[173] Young said combat would be ""daunting"" to D&D newcomers.[34]
There were complaints about bugs and diminishing polish in later portions of the game. The original review by Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia said the PC version's technical polish was impressive.[118] Following suggestions by players to review the end of the game, Battaglia noted substantial performance drops in the third act caused by the city's density.[184] Rebekah Valentine said the game's size concealed issues with the final act, describing it as less polished than the preceding two;[185] several other reviewers highlighted bugs.[55][28]  Writing for Digital Spy, Jess Lee said ""cracks began to show"" in act three, citing two companions reacting with relationship-ending anger to a decision and forgetting shortly thereafter.[186] According to IGN, bug complaints persisted months beyond release;[80][t] the game's first major patch fixed over 1000 bugs.[188] PC Gamer's Fraser Brown, meanwhile, expressed surprise at how few bugs surfaced on his playthrough given BG3's scope and complexity.[63]
Prior to the game's full release, Jason Schreier wrote that its success was likely, citing positive reception to the early access, strong pre-order sales, and high interest in the Dungeons and Dragons property.[117] The game sold 2.5 million copies during the early access period.[117]
It became one of 2023's largest launches after release.[189] In February 2024, Larian's publishing director Michael Douse said the game had over 10 million players.[u][191] As of 2023[update], Larian has not released precise sales figures.[123] The Irish Independent reported that Larian's 2023 pre-tax profit reached €249 million, a twentyfold from the previous year,[v] and citing 15 million copies sold.[193]
Vincke described the game's performance as ""way beyond"" expectations; he had been concerned the game's entire audience had purchased it during early access.[194] In a Q4 2023 earnings call, Wizards of the Coast's parent company Hasbro said the game had earned the company $90 million.[195] Douse said the game's player count increased 20% over 2024, with IGN's Wesley Yin-Poole attributing this to modding support.[196]
Baldur's Gate 3 had record-breaking award success continuing over a year beyond its release. According to Vincke, Larian sent rotating groups of staff to award ceremonies because it started to impact the studio's development activities.[197] In April 2024, the game became the first to win Game of the Year, or the equivalent category, at all five major ceremonies: the Golden Joystick Awards, the Game Developers Choice Awards, the DICE Awards, the BAFTAs, and The Game Awards.[198] Several publications also selected Baldur's Gate 3 as the best title of the year, including Ars Technica,[199] GameSpot,[200] GamesRadar+,[201] and PC Gamer.[202] It won the 2024 Hugo Award for Best Game or Interactive Work.[203]
At the Golden Joystick Awards, the game broke the previous record with seven wins, including Best Storytelling, Best Visual Design, and Studio of the Year for Larian.[204]  At The Game Awards, the game won in six of the nine nominated categories, including Best Role Playing Game, Best Community Support, and Best Multiplayer Game.[205] Baldur's Gate 3 was one of two titles to win multiple awards at the 27th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards,[w] receiving Role-Playing Game of the Year alongside Outstanding Achievements in Story, Game Design, and Game Direction.[206] At the BAFTA Game Awards, the title won five awards; lead writer Sarah Baylus and composer Borislav Slavov accepted the awards for Best Narrative and Best Music, respectively.[207] At the 24th Game Developers Choice Awards in San Francisco, it received four awards, including Best Narrative and Best Design.[208] It led The Steam Awards in 2023 with two wins, including Game of the Year and Outstanding Story-Rich Game.[209]
The game's performances received awards recognition. Neil Newbon (Astarion) won Best Supporting Performer at the Golden Joysticks and Best Performance at The Game Awards.[204][205] Newbon shared nominated with the game's narrator, Amelia Tyler, at several ceremonies, including the New York Game Awards and the Golden Joysticks.[210] Newbon's performance was also nominated at the DICE Awards alongside Samantha Béart (Karlach).[206] At the BAFTAs, Newbon, Béart and Tyler were nominated for Performer in a Leading Role. There were three nominations for the Performer in a Supporting Role award: Tracy Wiles (Jaheira), Dave Jones (Halsin) and Andrew Wincott (Raphael),[211] with Wincott's performance winning.[207] Several awards were for BG3's LGBTQ representation. It won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Video Game.[212] At the 2024 Gayming Awards, it received four nominations, including two for Best LGBTQ Character, winning with Shadowheart, and the Game of the Year.[213]
The game's score, and composer Borislav Slavov, received several nominations. In 2020 and 2021, he received Hollywood Music in Media Awards nominations for Original Song – Video Games (""Weeping Dawn"" and ""I Want to Live"", respectively),[214][215] and for the full score in 2023.[216] Slavov was nominated for Best Score and Music at The Game Awards.[205] Slavov won in the Music category at the BAFTAs.[207]
Following release, Larian reiterated interest in updating the game via patches but would not commit to downloadable content (DLC).[217] While delivering a March 2024 talk at Game Developers Conference, Vincke announced the studio would not develop a sequel or downloadable content.[218] While Larian started to work on DLC because of fan demand, there was no passion for the idea internally.[219] Larian subsequently said it was working on two projects,[220] using their own intellectual property for both and targeting a pre-2030 release for the first.[221]
As of 2025[update], there were several Dungeons & Dragons video games in production,[222] including one by Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance developer Invoke Studios,[223][224] a life simulation RPG by French developer Gameloft,[225][226] and an action-adventure game by Stig Asmussen's studio Giant Skull.[227][228] Another D&D project, a live service game by Swedish developer Starbreeze Studios, was cancelled in October 2025.[229][230] Hasbro's digital games vice-president Dan Ayoub said in March 2025 that discussions were ongoing over the future of Baldur's Gate and hoped to announce plans in the near future.[231]

Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn is a role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Interplay Entertainment. It is the sequel to 1998's Baldur's Gate and was released for Windows in September 2000. Following its predecessor, the game takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a fantasy campaign setting, and is based on the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition rules. Powered by BioWare's Infinity Engine, Baldur's Gate II uses an isometric perspective and pausable real-time gameplay. The player controls a party of up to six characters, one of whom is the player-created protagonist; the others are certain characters recruited from the game world.
Much of Baldur's Gate II takes place in and around Athkatla, a city in the country of Amn. Opening shortly after the events of Baldur's Gate, the game continues the story of the protagonist, Gorion's Ward, whose unique heritage has now drawn the attention of Jon Irenicus, a powerful and sinister mage. The storyline revolves around the machinations of Irenicus and the player's encounters with him.
Development began in January 1999. BioWare set out to improve upon the first Baldur's Gate in every way possible. From a list of constructive criticism—compiled from the suggestions of fans, reviews, and internal suggestions—a list of features to be added to the game was distilled: some of these were 800×600 resolution, 3D support, and character kits. For Baldur's Gate, the game's engine and content were being developed at the same time, whereas with Baldur's Gate II, the engine was working from the start. Having a completed engine meant they could direct their efforts towards making content, instead of focusing on basic functionality.
Shadows of Amn received critical acclaim, being praised for its gameplay, artwork, and voice acting, and is often regarded as one of the best video games ever made. GameSpy, GameSpot, and IGN awarded it their ""Role-Playing Game of the Year"" awards for 2000, and the game has sold more than two million units. An expansion pack, Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, was released in 2001. This well-received expansion, besides adding a large dungeon and enhancements to the game, concluded the main storyline. Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal have been included together in various compilations. In 2013, an enhanced version of Baldur's Gate II was released, carrying the title Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition and using an updated version of the Infinity Engine. A sequel, Baldur's Gate 3, developed by Larian Studios, was released in 2023.
Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn is an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition computer role-playing game. The central quest of the game consists of about 50 to 60 hours of play, while the full game, including all side quests, is estimated to be between 200 and 300 hours.[1][2] The player controls a party of up to six characters, one of whom is the protagonist;[3] if the protagonist dies, a saved-game must be loaded, or a new game begun. The game begins with character creation[4] through a series of configuration screens,[5] choosing such things as class, ability scores, appearance, and alignment.[6] Alternatively, an existing character from Baldur's Gate or its expansion Tales of the Sword Coast can be imported.[3][7] Once in the game world, the player may recruit certain non-player characters (NPCs) to travel with him or her, though only five may do so at a time; depending on who is present in the group, bickering, romance, and side quests can result.[8] NPCs in the party often converse with the player or with one another, and at times interject into the player's conversations with others.[9]
The game is played from an isometric perspective,[10] and the screen, which does not need to remain centered on the protagonist, can be scrolled with the mouse or keyboard. Areas are revealed as they are explored by the player's characters. A fog of war effect hides explored areas when the player's characters move away from them. The player can also change the formation in which the party moves.[11] Clicking an area exit, such as a doorway or staircase, causes another area to be loaded. Clicking on the edge of an outside area causes the party to travel there; the game then presents the player with the World Map, from which the player may select a destination.[12]
The player interacts with characters and objects by clicking on them.[13] Clicking on the ground causes the player's selected characters to move.[14] The gameplay, though in real-time, can be paused, whereupon commands may be issued to controllable characters, who will attempt to execute them when the game is unpaused.[15] The game can also be set to pause automatically at certain times.[8] Dialogue is started by NPCs at certain scripted times, or by the player's clicking on NPCs who are not immediately hostile. When speaking to an NPC, the player must often choose what to say from a list of responses. The dialogue may lead to quests or important information. When the player clicks on a hostile being, the currently selected characters will advance to attack it.[13] Information about characters, creatures, items, and buildings in the game environment is shown on a tool tip, which appears when the mouse pointer is held over game elements.[16]
When a character in the group gains the necessary experience points, he or she gains a level.[17] Experience points are awarded for certain player actions, such as killing enemies or completing quests.[18] The party also has a reputation, which is affected by the player's moral actions, and which, along with the party leader's charisma attribute, influences how NPCs in the game world react to the player.[19] The characters in the party will also complain if the party's reputation conflicts with their alignment.[20] Resting heals the characters in the party and refreshes those who are fatigued; also, resting allows a character to memorize spells.[21]  The game contains over 300 spells available for memorization.[22] With the exception of sorcerers, magic-users must memorize spells before they can be cast.[23][24] Spell-casting takes time and may be disrupted by attacks or other spells.[24]
The player can access sub-screens through the interface: area and world maps;[12] the journal, which tracks important information, such as quests and the game's plot;[25] the inventory page, which is used to manage and equip items;[26] the record screen, which is used to view information about, as well as level up, characters in the party;[27] the mage book and priest scroll screens, where spells can be inspected and memorized;[28] and the options screen, where settings may be altered, saved-games loaded, or the game saved or quit.[29]
During character creation the player chooses a class:[30] fighter, ranger, paladin, thief, bard, mage, cleric, druid, barbarian, monk, or sorcerer (the last three of which are new for the game).[3][31] Different classes have different special abilities and restrictions;[31] a thief character, for instance, can find and remove traps,[32] but thieves have limitations on which weapons and armor they may use, and cannot be of lawful good alignment.[33] Most classes also have a subset of kits, or specializations within a class, to choose from.[31][34] Kits have special advantages and, usually, disadvantages;[31] for example, the cavalier—one of the kits of the paladin class—specializes in fighting monsters such as dragons and demons, but cannot use missile weapons.[35] At some point in the game, the player may join or take over a stronghold. The type of stronghold is determined by the protagonist's class.[36]
The game also has a multiplayer mode, in which up to six human players can adventure through the game, controlling player-made characters as well as recruited NPCs.[37] The content of the game is otherwise the same,[37] and one player controls the protagonist.
The Forgotten Realms, the high fantasy campaign setting in which Baldur's Gate II is set, is a fictional world similar to a medieval Earth, but with its own peoples, geography, and history. In the Realms, as its inhabitants call it, fantastic creatures and magic are common.[38]
Baldur's Gate II takes place mainly in Amn, a country on the subcontinent of Faerûn. This country, known commonly as the Merchant Kingdom,[39] lies south of Baldur's Gate; wealth and trade are the chief concerns of the region.[39] The capital city of Athkatla, around which a fair portion of the game revolves, is the most important in Amn and is ruled by the anonymous Council of Six. The local thieves' guild, the Shadow Thieves, also has considerable power.[40] The group, which operates all along the Sword Coast,[41] is based in Athkatla.[42] Another powerful organization in Amn are the Cowled Wizards, who regulate the use of magic in the region.[41][43] The Shadow Thieves, the Cowled Wizards, and the Harpers, a semi-secret conglomeration of good organizations,[38] all factor prominently into the story and provide side quests.[22]
Besides Athkatla, other places the player will pass through include: an island, on which stands both the port town of Brynnlaw and the asylum Spellhold; the Underdark;[3] the city of Suldanessellar; and the Astral Plane.[3] There are also other places, which may be explored: the Umar Hills,[3] where people have been disappearing; a temple ruins,[3] fallen under the shadow of the Shade Lord; the de'Arnise Keep, home of the de'Arnises but recently overrun by trolls; the town of Trademeet, under attack by animals; a druid grove connected to Trademeet's woes; the Windspear Hills, where the player becomes entangled in the intrigues of Firkraag, a dragon; the underwater Sahuagin city; and the Planar Prison.
Baldur's Gate II is set in the year 1369 DR (Dale Reckoning),[44] and thus takes place not long after the Time of Troubles (1358 DR), when the Tablets of Fate, powerful magic items which maintain a balance between good and evil, were stolen.[45] Lord Ao, the Overdeity, forced the gods to become mortal until the Tablets were found;[45] some gods died while in this mortal state.[38][44]
Bhaal, the God of Murder, was slain by an adventurer named Cyric, who himself became a god,[46] but Bhaal foresaw his destruction and walked the land before the other gods.[22] He left behind him ""a score of mortal progeny"", whose later deaths, when they were slain by heroes, would fuel his rebirth.[47] The game's protagonist is one of these offspring,[47] but, through the choices of the player, may be either good or evil.[22] The character grew up in the library fortress of Candlekeep, watched over by the mage Gorion.[47] Imoen, who grew up there as well, became a close friend.[48][47] The story of the first Baldur's Gate followed their adventure along the Sword Coast, where the hero learned of their heritage and defeated their half-brother Sarevok, a fellow child of Bhaal.
Some notable characters in Shadows of Amn include: Gaelan Bayle, who offers the party the help of the Shadow Thieves;[49][50] Aran Linvail, the leader of the Shadow Thieves;[51] Saemon Havarian, who sails the party to an island;[52] Adalon, a silver dragon whose eggs have been stolen and given to drow;[53] Elhan;[54] and Queen Ellesime, the ruler of Suldanessellar.[55] Jon Irenicus and his sister Bodhi are the chief antagonists, Irenicus being the main villain of the game. Forgotten Realms character Drizzt Do'Urden also makes an appearance; if the player solicits his aid, he and his companions will later help the player.[8]
In Baldur's Gate II, several characters from the first game reappear, of which the following can join the player's party: Imoen, who grew up with the protagonist in Candlekeep;[48] Jaheira, who, with her husband Khalid, was a friend of Gorion's;[56] Minsc, a warrior who carries with him a hamster named Boo;[57] Edwin, a Red Wizard of Thay;[58] and Viconia, a dark elf cleric.[8][58] There are also many new NPCs who may join the party: Aerie, a winged elf who has lost her wings and was sold to the circus by slavers at a young age;[59][60][61] Keldorn, an older paladin and a powerful and respected member of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart;[62][63] Mazzy, an honorable halfling fighter and ""the nearest thing to a paladin that a halfling can aspire to"";[63] Nalia, who is of the upper class, but, though conscious of class distinction, tries to help those less fortunate than herself;[64][65] Valygar, who is of a family noted for its talented magic-users, but hates the art;[66] Anomen, a member of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, and whose wish is to become a full knight;[66] Cernd, a druid;[66] Haer'Dalis, a tiefling bard and one of the actors of an acting troupe;[63][67] Jan, a gnome, of the Jansen family;[68] Yoshimo, a thief from the land of Kara-Tur;[68] and Korgan, an evil dwarven fighter.[8][59]
Shortly after the events of Baldur's Gate, the hero and companions are overcome and taken captive.[8] When the game opens, the player character awakens in a cage and is then experimented on by a wizard, who is aware of the player character's heritage and speaks of ""untapped power"". The wizard is distracted as his complex is attacked by Shadow Thieves, and disappears to fight them. Imoen, appearing from a side room, frees the player character. Jaheira and Minsc are also held in cells close by. Minsc reveals that his witch Dynaheir was killed sometime after their capture, while Jaheira's husband Khalid is later found tortured to death, leaving Jaheira emotionally devastated. The characters fight their way through the underground complex, learning more and more of their captor's despicable character and that his name is Irenicus. At length, escaping the complex, they emerge into the city of Athkatla and witness Irenicus fighting off some of his attackers, whom he destroys. An argument then ensues, during which Imoen angrily attacks Irenicus using magic. The Cowled Wizards appear and, after a fight, arrest both Irenicus and Imoen for the unsanctioned use of magic, and teleport both of them away.[49]
In the slums of Athkatla, a man named Gaelan Bayle offers the party the help of a powerful organization, who can find Imoen or Irenicus for the large sum of 20,000 gold pieces.[49] The party is approached by and offered the help of another rival guild headed by Bodhi;[50][51] it is the player's choice whom to side with.[50] Meanwhile, Imoen and Irenicus have been removed to an asylum called Spellhold, which is situated on an island. Irenicus soon breaks his bonds and prepares to experiment on Imoen.
Back in Athkatla, the party raises the money necessary and receives assistance from whichever organization it has decided to work with,[51] and gains passage to the island on a ship sailed by the dubious and treacherous Saemon Havarian. The heroes then manage to get inside Spellhold, but they are captured by Irenicus, who has taken control of the prison and had planned all along to bring the protagonist there. Irenicus then subjects the protagonist to a ritual, taking the latter's soul. Imoen, who turns out to be a Child of Bhaal as well, had earlier undergone Irenicus's ritual, and her soul has gone to Bodhi, Irenicus's sister. Bodhi then abandons the party to the maze beneath Spellhold, so that she can hunt them after a span of time, saying also, as bait, that Irenicus may yet be foiled. When they face her, the now soulless protagonist loses control and transforms into a creature called the Slayer, one of the avatar forms of Bhaal. Bodhi, quite taken aback, retreats to tell Irenicus of it. The player character returns to their normal self after a short while. Soon, with the aid of Spellhold's inmates, the party battles Irenicus, forcing him to retreat. The party follows,[52] and reaches the surface via the Underdark.[53]
Upon reaching the surface, the party encounters the army of the elven city of Suldanessellar. The elves cannot return to the city, for Irenicus has magically hidden it. To gain access to it, the party secures the Rhynn Lanthorn from Bodhi, who has stolen the artifact; upon Bodhi's death, Imoen's soul is restored.[54] The Rhynn Lanthorn lights the way to Suldanessellar,[54][69] which has been invaded by Irenicus and his minions. The party proceeds through the city and, at the Tree of Life, learns that Irenicus is draining the power of the Tree, which will doom Suldanessellar. The heroes defeat him, but because Irenicus still has the protagonist's soul, the protagonist is dragged with the wizard into Hell, and the rest of the party are dragged along also. When they defeat Irenicus, they return to life and are honored by the elves of Suldanessellar.[69]
Baldur's Gate II was developed by BioWare and published by Black Isle Studios, a division of Interplay Entertainment. The game uses the same Infinity Engine as Baldur's Gate (1998), but with many improvements. Other games that used this engine were Black Isle Studios' Planescape: Torment (1999) and Icewind Dale (2000). BioWare dedicated Baldur's Gate II to Daniel Walker, who died in 1999 and was the company's second employee.[70]
Though a success, both commercially and critically, Baldur's Gate was the first role-playing game designed by BioWare, and they applied what they learned in the process to Baldur's Gate II.[71] They also felt they did not have enough time to reach their design goals with the first game, due to developing both the content of the game and the Infinity Engine at the same time.[10] In Baldur's Gate II, it was determined that the designers should be allowed ""adequate time"" so that the game might ""reach its full potential"".[10] Throughout its development, BioWare focused ""on ensuring that Baldur's Gate II is significantly better than Baldur's Gate in every way possible, and to make it appeal not only to fans of the original game but also to make it accessible to new fans who never played the original game"".[71]
Development of Baldur's Gate II began in January 1999.[72] From the suggestions of fans on message boards and newsgroups, reviews of Baldur's Gate, and internal suggestions, a list of constructive criticism was compiled; from this list, a slightly shorter one of features to be added to the game was made.[72] Some of the items on this list were: support for higher resolutions, such as 800 by 600 pixels and above; 3D support; non-pausing dialogue in multiplayer; drop off panels in the interface; character kits; dual-wielding of weapons; a streamlined journal and annotable map; deathmatch; and inclusion of famous AD&D monsters such as the dragon.[10] Not many features had to be cut, and they kept as many as they could.[10] Because of the engine's mature state of development, most features were fairly easy to add.[10] Co-lead designer James Ohlen wrote that having a completed engine meant they could direct their efforts towards producing content, instead of focusing on ""basic functionality"".[73] Producer Ben Smedstad said that ""the engine was up and running since day one, which is a huge morale booster. When a monster is complete, we put it into the 'override' directory and it appears in the game! This is a huge change from working on the original"".[72] Late in the project, deathmatch was removed, while non-pausing dialogue, which proved ""the most problematic feature"", was removed early on before being reintroduced in early 2000.[10]
Baldur's Gate II reused the Infinity Engine, which had powered Baldur's Gate, but the engine was improved in many ways since development on Baldur's Gate II began: optional 800×600 resolution as well as the old 640×480 resolution. Drop-away side panels were implemented; for spells and special effects, 3D support was added.[74] Pathfinding had been improved in Tales of the Sword Coast (the Baldur's Gate expansion), and was improved further in Shadows of Amn through a feature called ""bumping"", which allowed a character to move another one out of the way if the path was blocked. Also, to aid pathfinding even more, paths in dungeons were widened, so that characters would get stuck less often. The interface was also refined a bit.[75]
To avoid some of the design mistakes made in Baldur's Gate, guidelines were drawn up for each department; the level designers had the longest set of guidelines. These lists continually changed and evolved as the development progressed. The main design guidelines for the entire project were that the players should feel like their actions have an effect on the game world, and good versus evil options should be available depending on which path the player takes. Guidelines for the story were to keep the focus on the player's character, keep the player updated on the activities of the game's villain, add a significant plot twist, and make the ending of the game open enough so that there would be room for more sequels. Environment guidelines were to break the game into chapters, make some locations key to the central plot, keep areas interesting and easy to quickly navigate, and showcase areas before they were available to explore to capture player interest. For the game systems, guidelines focused on character customization and a well-crafted reward system. The writing guidelines were concerned mainly with dialogue: limiting the number of sentences NPCs spoke at a time, keeping the number of player response choices at three as often as possible, avoiding profanity and accents, and having a small set of random dialogue for unimportant NPCs. Many early design decisions did not follow the guidelines, and programming constraints were not always followed by other departments, such as design and art, leading to slowdowns in some parts of the game that were difficult or impossible to fix.[76]
The process for creating levels was long and complicated. It began with the creation of a general layout of the area to be built by designers. They would pass this concept map to the artists, who added models to it, beginning with the largest objects and ending with small items such as individual pieces of furniture. After everything was put in place by the art team, designers took over again, inserting graphical enhancements, effects, and collision detection code. With a functional level, creatures, items, traps, and triggers were added last, then scripts were written for everything to control behavior. The team found it quite difficult to keep track of changes made to levels, and there were sometimes communication problems between different parts of the team, such as the artists and designers, resulting in inconsistencies between their work. Co-executive producer Ray Muzyka wrote that ""they learned to make sure all elements of the team are talking to each other and working as a group, rather than as a bunch of individuals!"" They did feel they had done a good job automating the level creation process, as levels were rapidly designed. Muzyka also said that ""a designer might submit a level description and receive it, art complete, a month later ready for scripting, but missing some key features (almost always a door). We would then have to determine whether the omission was important enough to have the art piece redone, or whether we could simply tweak the design of the level to fit the finished art"".[76] Areas were made more compact than before, the amount of ""dead space"" being curtailed, facilitating faster travel between key areas because less distance has to be traveled.[75][77]
Marcia Tofer, art director for Shadows of Amn, worked with a team of 8 to 12 people to create the game's artwork, such as the backgrounds, monsters, etc. Tofer observed that the city of Baldur's Gate had been their first attempt at city building and what they learned there served to make Athkatla ""far more diverse and interesting"". City renders took from 18 to 24 hours, though they used hardware that was powerful for those days: multiple dual Pentium IIIs at 500 MHz, coupled with 512 MB of memory.[78]
In traditional mediums like text or film and television, what is read or seen is effectively controlled by the creators. Games are a visual medium, according to Luke Kristjanson, one of the writers and designers on Shadows of Amn, but they are unlike the traditional ones of film and television. For Baldur's Gate, the developers knew what would be seen on the critical path, but not when players would see it, or whether the right amount of significance would be placed upon it.[79]
In Shadows of Amn, several tools were used to remedy these shortcomings. One of these were in-game cutscenes, which were like small plays, ""adding suspense and depth to the world and overall story"". Cutscenes had been used in Baldur's Gate, but were employed ""more effectively"" in Shadows of Amn. Another technique was to increase, to a greater degree than Baldur's Gate, the interactivity of the characters that travel with the player. While the characters in Baldur's Gate possessed ""banter"", there was a very great increase of this in Shadows of Amn, but was not merely an increase in the amount of dialogue and text. NPCs interject, reinforcing ""the importance of events [and] contributing their own motivations"". They recognize critical junctures in the game, since those are of significance to them as well.[79] They even make comments to each other, as Kristjanson put it: ""If Imoen thinks that Jaheira is being too strict she'll say so, and if Jaheira thinks Imoen is being immature she'll counter, and if Minsc thinks the both of them would benefit from getting hamsters of their own [...] he won't hesitate to offer that little nugget of wisdom"".[80] Kristjanson noted that the character of Imoen was unexpectedly popular with players of the first game, in spite of the fact that she was a late addition during development and was undeveloped as a character. Kristjanson remarked that her lack of interactions with other characters in the first game projected an impression of closeness to the player character, although this was not intended by the developers; this led to her being revealed as the player character's half-sister in its sequel and an integral character to its plot.[81]
Producer Ben Smedstad, speaking of ""crunch time"" during the latter stages of a game's development, noted that it was important to begin it at the right time, not too early, nor too late. By July 2000, Shadows of Amn had entered its second phase of crunch, where the hours ran from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Mondays to Fridays, and from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays. Their first crunch phase had been a normal working week, but hours of 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays. ""As long as it takes"" would be the philosophy of the last phase, encompassing the last week of development. Smedstad said that the second phase, which they were working under in July 2000, is where the stress really begins, and that the third phase is actually not as bad as one might think, because by then people are used to the lengthy hours.[82]
During the game's development, a quality assurance department was added to BioWare, and the game's publishers lent their assistance in testing.[76] Muzyka wrote that ""because of its immense size, Baldur's Gate II was a tester's nightmare—this was compounded by the fact that we didn't do enough testing as areas were being developed"".[83] The game contained about 290 quests, each of which had to be tested in both single- and multi-player modes.[83] BioWare used a method, introduced to them by Feargus Urquhart, Douglas Avery, and Chris Parker of Black Isle Studios, in which the game's quests were listed on whiteboards, with a cross placed beside each quest.[83] Pairs consisting of a designer and tester worked their way through the quests, each pair covering about six quests per day.[84] When a quest was verified, its cross was removed.[83]
Muzyka wrote:
In the final days of working on BG2 there was a strangely serene feeling in the office. We didn't experience the headlong panic that is sometimes prevalent while finishing a game, but we certainly did experience considerable stress as we built 21 final candidates in 3 days. After a few long nights with the whole team playing the game over and over again, we reached a point where we built a good final candidate. Then it was sent to the duplicators![83]Black Isle Studios, the publisher, handled the game's voice-over. Producer Chris Parker, writing in April 2000 about the upcoming voice-over recording sessions as Baldur's Gate II neared completion, observed that it could only start once story and dialogue were done. A script would then be put together that, in addition to the lines, would have other information; for example, emotional states and directions that would guide actors to perform lines the right way. Since Black Isle Studios was near Hollywood, there was a lot of voice-over talent in the area. Roughly 50 actors would be needed, and most of the casting would be done by tape using talent they were familiar with. As producer, Parker's job would be to make sure that performances were in the right spirit; the studio would handle the technical side of things. Sometimes, different lines would be tried to see what sounded better, and if that version ended up being used, the text in the game would have to be changed to match it.[85] English actor David Warner provided the voice for Jon Irenicus; PC Gamer observed that ""his commanding portrayal of the arrogant elven mage made Irenicus one of the most memorable villains in RPGs, and is one of the key reasons why Baldur's Gate 2 remains such an arresting experience today"".[86]
Michael Hoenig, a German composer who played with Tangerine Dream, composed the game's music.[87] He also composed the music for the first Baldur's Gate.[88][89]
Baldur's Gate II was announced in November 1999.[90] The game went gold on September 14, 2000, and shipped in North America on September 21, and in Europe and Australia on September 29.[91][92][93] Also released was a Collector's Edition, which included the game, a cloth map, eight character-trading cards, a Black Isle Studios writing tablet, and an additional CD containing unique armor and weapons as well as music from the soundtrack.[94] A Macintosh version was ported by MumboJumbo and released on October 15, 2001.[95]
Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, an expansion pack for Shadows of Amn, was developed by BioWare and published by Black Isle Studios, and released in June 2001. Throne of Bhaal takes the protagonist's history further, and, being the final chapter, concludes the Baldur's Gate saga.[96] It also added a variety of features to the base game: a new dungeon called Watcher's Keep, which can be accessed from both Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal;[97] new features and enhancements, such as high-level class abilities, a higher experience point cap, and the Wild Mage character class;[98][99][100] and new items and spells.[99][101] Reviewers generally praised Throne of Bhaal and thought it a spectacular conclusion to the Baldur's Gate saga.[102][103][104][105][106] It won the ""PC Role-Playing"" award at the 2002 Interactive Achievement Awards.[107]
Shadows of Amn was re-released, along with its expansion, Throne of Bhaal, as Baldur's Gate II: The Collection in 2003.[108] In 2004, they were bundled with the original Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale as Black Isle Compilation Part Two. In 2006, they were re-released with Baldur's Gate and Tales of the Sword Coast as Baldur's Gate: 4 in 1 Boxset.[109] They were also included in The Forgotten Realms Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Dungeons & Dragons, and Dungeons & Dragons Anthology: The Master Collection.[110][111][112] In 2010, Baldur's Gate II Complete was released in digital format on GOG.com, including both Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal. Bundled with it are the game manuals in PDF format, high-definition wallpapers, artwork, avatars, and the Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal soundtracks.[113]
Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition was released in 2013.[114] Developed by Overhaul Games, it is an enhanced version of Baldur's Gate II and uses an updated version of the Infinity Engine.[115] The game was released for PC,[116][117] iOS,[118][119] Mac OS X, Linux, and Android. Skybound Games, a division of Skybound Entertainment, brought Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch in 2019.[120][121]
In the United States, Baldur's Gate II entered PC Data's computer game sales charts at #5 during the September 17–23 period.[122] It rose to second place the following week, behind The Sims: Livin' Large, while its Collector's Edition captured the seventh position.[123] In its first 14 days, Baldur's Gate II drew in revenues of $4 million across all SKUs in North America, a sales record for an Interplay computer title.[124] The game and its Collector's Edition were ranked 11th and 19th, respectively, on PC Data's monthly chart for September.[125] Entering its third week, the game fell to fifth place on the weekly chart,[126] but it remained in the top 10 throughout the October 5–28 period,[127][128][129] and finished seventh for the month.[130] Afterwards, it was absent from PC Data's weekly top 10 and monthly top 20.[131][132] PC Data reported Baldur's Gate II's sales at 199,914 copies and its revenues at $9.2 million in the United States by the end of 2000.[133] The game's success in the country continued during 2001, when it finished 15th for January and sold another 103,144 units between February and the first week of November alone.[134][135] It tallied 225,763 domestic sales for the full year, which drew $9.63 million in revenue.[136]
On Media Control's computer game sales rankings for the German market, Baldur's Gate II debuted at #3 in October 2000. It climbed to second place the following month,[137] before dropping to 12th in December.[138] The Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) presented it with a ""Gold"" award by the end of 2000,[139] indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.[140] Media Control proceeded to rank the game 10th, 17th and 23rd during the first three months of 2001, respectively.[138][141] In the United Kingdom, Baldur's Gate II claimed #2 for its release month of November 2000, according to Chart-Track.[142] It fell to tenth place in December, and exited the top 10 in January 2001.[143][144]
The combined global sales of Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast, and Baldur's Gate II surpassed 3.5 million copies by March 2001.[145] Baldur's Gate II alone reached almost 1.5 million sales by December 2002,[146] and more than 2 million by November 2005.[147] According to the NPD Group, the game totaled 480,000 sales ($19.6 million) in the United States by August 2006. At that time, Edge declared it the country's 31st-best-selling computer game released since January 2000.[148]
Baldur's Gate II received critical acclaim upon its release,[150] and is listed as the eight highest-scoring PC game on the review aggregator Metacritic (as of August 2024).[177] GameSpot's reviewer stated that, while it is a long game, its fine points are what make it so great, and that it was in a class by itself.[9] IGN concluded with a similar sentiment, saying that the game was incomparable and without peers.[158] Though extolling the game immensely and finding only small issues, Computer Gaming World's reviewer noted that he would not trap himself with the ""best RPG ever"" phrase, but conceded that it ""certainly ranks up there with greats like Fallout, Planescape: Torment, and Betrayal at Krondor"".[152] Eurogamer lavished much praise upon Baldur's Gate II, and noted that ""the story and quests are captivating, the gameplay tried and tested, and the overall feel is professional and entertaining"".[153] David Simkins reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it five stars out of five, and wrote that ""Baldur's Gate II raises the bar for PC RPGs, elevating the genre to a new level"".[159]
GameSpot and IGN felt the game was superior to its predecessor, Baldur's Gate.[9][158] Computer Games Magazine and Gameplanet noted that it improved upon Baldur's Gate in almost every way.[164][166] ""Polish"" or ""polished"" was a description applied to the game by some reviewers.[158][161][160] RPGamer, somewhat more critical of the game than others, concluded: ""Maybe it's a bit thin in some areas, but it's still an exemplary game that is well worth the time invested"".[8]
Baldur's Gate II's gameplay was called ""addicting"" by GamePro.[155] RPGamer said that while the game was generally the same as the original Baldur's Gate, the combat was much improved, with less frustration and more strategic options.[8] Computer Gaming World agreed, saying players would put more consideration into designing and implementing combat plans.[152] Eurogamer noted that the interface was ""incredibly easy to use"".[153] IGN's reviewer observed that many a time the game posed tough decisions that made him think, and also praised the clarity of the quests and ease of moving from one goal to the next.[158] Some reviewers, however, felt the non-player characters in the game were not as powerful as player-made characters.[165] GameSpy said the game is much more difficult than Baldur's Gate and requires more strategy and planning than the original does.[156] GameSpot felt the opening level of the game fell flat, but that it got much better once the player reached Athkatla.[9] IGN noted that the introductory section of the game, while good, was nowhere near as fun as the adventures in Athkatla.[158]
The game's plot was met positively by most reviewers,[164][152][153][9][157][162] GameSpy calling it ""epic"" and GameSpot a ""great story"".[156][9] Eurogamer felt the story quite outdid the original.[153] Computer Gaming World, too, observed that it was much improved, adding that the plot style was reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings.[152] He felt the story was somewhere between Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale in terms of depth.[152] RPGamer's reviewer, on the other hand, felt that the plot was lackluster, but approved of the side quests, which, he said, could turn into ""minor epics"" of their own.[8]
The game's graphics were well received. GamePro praised them, saying that ""the backdrops are stunning and the spell effects are impressive"".[155] IGN echoed this statement, calling the difference between Baldur's Gate and Shadows of Amn ""like looking at a still oil painting, and then turning to see the scene in living motion on a big screen TV"".[158] Eurogamer, too, commended the artwork.[153] GameSpot thought both the pre-rendered backgrounds and the animations for characters and monsters were well done.[9] FiringSquad said the game's artwork surpassed that of Planescape: Torment, and called the background artwork ""fantastic"".[165] The voice acting of Baldur's Gate II was also praised by FiringSquad, who said that ""characters sound alive and vivacious (or depressed, crazy—whatever suits them)"" and that the quality of the voices drew the player more deeply into the game.[165] IGN called the voice acting ""outstanding"" and said the variety of personalities would cause players to become ""attached"" to the characters, only noting with disapproval the dearth of new voices for the player's protagonist.[158] Reviewers generally found the game's music to be well-done,[9][165][157][158][166] but RPGamer felt it was ""inoffensive but unimpressive"".[8]
Gameplanet criticized the game's poor support for online multiplayer, saying it was ""unstable and quite frustrating"".[166] FiringSquad felt that the lack of communication between players in combat during online games was problematic, but that local area network play would be more satisfying.[165] PC Zone said that multiplayer was as unimpressive as it had been in the first game of the series and that the game needed multiplayer maps.[163] IGN, however, felt that multiplayer play was solidly implemented and fun.[158] Pathfinding was sometimes criticized.[152][156][161][162][166] Criticism was also directed at bugs in the game, such as frequent crashes when trying to access certain locations.[163] According to GameSpy, Baldur's Gate II is ""not 100% stable"".[156] GameSpot noted that the game's loading times were somewhat long and that the game crashed on occasion, but said that these problems are not significant.[9] IGN, though noting that the game slowed down during combat when a lot of animations were happening simultaneously because of spells or ""dazzling backgrounds"", said that there were almost no other technical problems.[158] GameSpot also felt that the small number of character portraits to choose from was a disappointment and was displeased that the game reused special effects, audio, and graphics from the first game.[9]
GameSpot later called Baldur's Gate II ""a towering achievement in the history of role-playing games"".[172] In a 2007 Gamasutra article on the ""Platinum and Modern Ages"" of computer role-playing games (CRPGs), Matt Barton noted contemporary reviewers' universal praise for the game, and called it ""the finest CRPG ever designed"".[178] According to GameSpy, ""this is easily one of the finest CRPGs ever made and an experience that no RPG fan should miss"".[179]
Baldur's Gate II has been honored many times. GameSpot, GameSpy, and IGN awarded it their ""Role-Playing Game of the Year"" awards in 2000,[171][173][174] and it won GameSpot's Readers' Choice Game of the Year award for that year.[170] It received three ""Gaming Globe"" awards from Eurogamer in 2001: Best Game, Best Art Direction, and Best Male Supporting Character (for Minsc).[168] The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences honored Shadows of Amn with the ""Character or Story Development"" award at the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards; the game also received nominations for the ""Game of the Year"", ""PC Game of the Year"", ""PC Role-Playing"", and ""Game Play Engineering"" categories.[167] IGN placed it at No. 25 on their 2005 ""Top 100 Games of All Time"" list.[175] In 2006, though not ranking in the top five games, it earned an ""honorable mention"" in Gamasutra's Quantum Leap Awards.[180] Baldur's Gate II was inducted into GameSpot's ""Greatest Games of All Time"" list.[172] In 2009, Game Informer placed Baldur's Gate II at No. 88 on their list of ""The Top 200 Games of All Time"", calling it ""the best Dungeons & Dragons game ever made"". This is up one place from their top 100 list in 2001.[169][181] Empire ranked it No. 19 on their list of the 100 Greatest Games.[182] At the end of 2009, Baldur's Gate II, though not quite making the Top 12 list, received an honorable mention in Gamasutra's Game of the Decade, where readers voted for their best game of the 2000s.[183]
In 2010, on IGN's Top 25 Modern PC Games, Baldur's Gate II clocked in at No. 2.[176] In 2013, it was placed at No. 46 on GamingBolt's ""Top 100 greatest video games ever made"".[184] IGN ranked Baldur's Gate II No. 1 on their list of ""The Top 11 Dungeons & Dragons Games of All Time"" in 2014.[185] Ian Williams of Paste rated the game No. 2 on his list of ""The 10 Greatest Dungeons and Dragons Videogames"" in 2015.[186] IGN ranked Baldur's Gate II No. 3 on their ""Top 100 RPGs of All Time"" list.[187] In 2016, PC Gamer noted the game on their ""best RPGs of all time"".[188] It was placed at No. 9 on Game Informer's ""Top 100 RPGs Of All Time"" list,[189] and was included among PCGamesN's ""best RPGs on PC"" as well.[190]
There is a novelization of the game by Philip Athans. Published in 2000 by Wizards of the Coast, it focuses solely on Abdel, the last of the Bhaalspawn.[191] The novel is the second in the series; the first, also by Athans, is a novelization of Baldur's Gate,[192] and the third, by Drew Karpyshyn, of the Throne of Bhaal expansion.[193]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Generation_(magazine),Next Generation (magazine),"
Next Generation  was a US video game magazine that was published by Imagine Media (now Future US).[2] It was affiliated to and shared content with the UK's Edge magazine. Next Generation ran from January 1995 until January 2002. It was published by Jonathan Simpson-Bint and edited by Neil West. Other editors included Chris Charla, Tom Russo, and Blake Fischer.[3]
Next Generation initially covered the 32-bit consoles including 3DO, Atari Jaguar, and the then-still unreleased Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Unlike competitors GamePro and Electronic Gaming Monthly, the magazine was directed towards a different readership by focusing on the industry itself rather than individual games.
The magazine was first published by GP Publications up until May 1995 when the publisher rebranded as Imagine Media.
In September 1999, Next Generation was redesigned, and its cover name shortened NextGen. A year later, in September 2000, the magazine's width was increased from its standard 8 inches to 9 inches. This wider format lasted less than a year.
The brand was resurrected in 2005 by Future Publishing USA as an industry-led website, Next-Gen.biz. It carried much the same articles and editorial as the print magazine, and reprinted many articles from Edge, the UK-based sister magazine to Next-Gen.
In July 2008, Next-Gen.biz was rebranded as Edge-Online.com.[4]
Next Generation's content did not focus on screenshots, walkthroughs, and cheat codes. Instead the content was more focused on game development from an artistic perspective. Interviews with people in the video game industry often featured questions about gaming in general rather than about the details of the latest game or game system they were working on.
Next Generation was first published prior to the North American launch of the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, and much of the early content was in anticipation of those consoles.
Apart from the regular columns, the magazine did not use bylines. The editors explained that they felt the magazine's entire staff should share the credit or responsibility for each article and review, even those written by individuals.[5]
The review ranking system was based on a number of stars (1 through 5) that ranked games based on their merits overall compared to what games were already out there.
Next Generation had a few editorial sections like ""The Way Games Ought To Be"" (originally written every month by game designer Chris Crawford) that would attempt to provide constructive criticism on standard practices in the video game industry.
The magazine's construction and design was decidedly simple and clean, its back cover having no advertising on it initially, a departure from most other gaming magazines. The first several years of Next Generation had a heavy matte laminated finish cover stock, unlike the glossy paper covers of its competitors. The magazine moved away from this cover style in early 1999, only for it to return again in late 2000.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qadim:_The_Genie%27s_Curse,Al-Qadim: The Genie's Curse,"
Al-Qadim: The Genie's Curse is an action role-playing game for the personal computer set in the Al-Qadim campaign setting of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. The game was developed by Cyberlore Studios and published in 1994 by Strategic Simulations (SSI). The game combines role-playing game and adventure with a simplified interface; the player character is a young corsair trying to clear his family's name, rescue his betrothed and determine who has been freeing genies from their masters.
A genie becomes freed from his master's control by mysterious forces which are liberating genies for the Nameless Masters.[2] As the story begins, the player character (the son of sultan Zubin Al-Hazrad of Zaratan) is a young man who has just finished his training as a corsair.[2][3] The corsair is betrothed to the daughter of a caliph.[2] The caliph and his daughter are involved in a hurricane-induced shipwreck, which sweeps the girl overboard.[2] The corsair and his family are blamed for the shipwreck;[2][3] he must find his bride-to-be and restore his family's honor.[2][3] The character can interact with his family (including his parents and sister), working to save them from execution;[4] they must also explore the mystery of who has been unleashing genies on the land,[3] and investigate the Genie's Curse.[5]
Unlike the games in SSI's Gold Box series, character generation is greatly simplified. The player chooses a name, by which they are known throughout the game. There is no race, class or skill selection, and play begins immediately.[5] The single player character begins as a 2nd-level corsair, whose statistics are predetermined;[2] the player also cannot change his weapons or armor,[1] although he can eventually improve his starting sword.[2] The character earns experience points by answering puzzles and completing quests, some of which do not involve combat.[3] The character gains levels after accumulating sufficient experience points; gaining levels improves his hit point total, and grants the ability to master new skills for combat.[2]
The game features a simple interface,[3] with icon menus instead of text.[5] Character movement and most object manipulation are controlled by mouse, although the player may use a keyboard or joystick.[2] The player chooses all actions (except movement and projectile weapons) by pressing a single action key (or mouse button), which causes the character to automatically take the correct action with an object; the character either automatically picks up significant objects or can choose to take an object that the character looks at.[2] To talk to characters, or attack monsters with the scimitar, the player moves the character towards the target and clicks.[4] The player selects the difficulty level of the game, which determines the how powerful the monsters are.[2] At the beginning of the game, the player learns how to maneuver the character by moving quickly through a trap-filled dungeon hallway.[4] Al-Qadim features simple, real-time combat, with the character using either one or two weapons simultaneously.[2] The character can use special objects to increase the power of the scimitar, and his ranged weapon is a sling or magic shards which cast various spells.[2] If the character is injured, he can regain hit points with healing potions or be magically healed at special locations.[2]
The game places less emphasis on typical role-playing game elements (such as exploration, combat and magic), favoring adventure-game elements (such as problem-solving and object manipulation)[2] and featuring a smaller world to explore.[3] Travel is shown overhead, including using ships and flying carpets.[2] The character is visible in three-quarter view, but the character and monsters are shown in side view when moving.[4] In many areas, travel is one-directional.[2]  Conversations are shown on the screen as text, and the player clicks on which sentences (or phrases) to use.[2] The game includes puzzles and mazes which are important to advancing the plot.[2]
Developer Cyberlore hired a team to create The Genie's Curse shortly after the company was founded in 1992, and it took the company fourteen months to develop the game.[6] It was designed by Herb Perez and produced by Lester Humphreys; the lead programmer was Ken Grey, the art was by Garrett McCarty and Herb Perez and the SSI producer was Bret Berry.[4]
Al-Qadim: The Genie's Curse (1994) was one of several games published by SSI from 1992 to 1994 in TSR's settings on a number of game engines,[7] and was later included in the 1996 AD&D Masterpiece Collection compilation set.[8]
For the MMORPG Dark Sun Online: Crimson Sands the developer used images from Al-Qadim to finish the title on time despite a low development budget.[9]
The game was re-released in 2015 on GOG.com with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Substituting for Scorpia,[12] Petra Schlunk reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World. Stating that ""SSI has taken a decisive step away from"" products like Ravenloft and Dark Sun, she reported that it was ""not a standard role-playing game and it is not a standard adventure game. Al-Qadim is a story in which we get to play the main character"". While decrying limited player options, Schlunk added that ""the story is charming, graphically pleasing [...] of reasonable length [...] and worth 'playing'. In this game, elements of both role-playing and adventure games are blended cleverly with one of the most facile interfaces to date"". Schlunk concluded: ""Borrowing heavily from the Arabian Nights, Al-Qadim has captured the charm and wonder of those tales"".[2]
Computer Shopper praised the game, saying that it ""managed to capture the feel of the Al-Qadim setting"". The magazine noted the graphics and audio, calling both ""typical high-quality SSI offerings"";[5] the game's use of honor (""portrayed in a way that isn't trite"") was also cited.[5]
PC Gamer UK's Andy Butcher wrote that ""Al-Qadim tries hard to be accessible, inoffensive and appeal to the masses, but ... it's unlikely to whet the appetites of either hardened role-players (it's far too superficial) or newcomers (it's got little of a really good RPG's appeal)"".[10] In PC Zone, David McCandless summarized the game as ""not very good"", with ""poor"" graphics and ""awful"" combat.[11]
The Genie's Curse was reviewed in Dragon #208 (1994) by Sandy Petersen in the ""Eye of the Monitor"" column. Petersen gave the game four (out of five) stars:[4] he called the game a ""heaps of fun"" with interesting and exotic environment.[4]
James V. Trunzo reviewed Al-Qadim: The Genie's Curse in White Wolf #47 (Sept., 1994), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that ""I like this game. It has one of the more entertaining plots of its type. It also integrates music, dialogue and graphics to stay true to the genre. Unfortunately, you can run into problems early on that might stymie you.""[13]
Allen Rausch wrote for GameSpy that Al-Qadim: The Genie's Curse was ""basically SSI's answer to Nintendo's Zelda games"", but ""it wasn't a very good answer ...as so often happens when a game tries to appeal to two very different audiences at the same time, neither element was entirely successful"". He concluded that the game ""had its moments, but it wasn't a game that ever approached the realm of 'classic'"".[1] In a similar review for GameSpot, Andrew Park and Elliott Chin felt that the game may not appeal to serious RPG fans.[3]
Michael Hengst, editor of Power Play, called the combination of the 1001 Nights-style Al-Qadim setting with the action-packed gameplay of Zelda successful. Hengst and main tester Volker Weitz described its difficulty as low, and gave it an overall rating of 74 percent.[14]
The game sold in excess of 90,000 copies.[15]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_(film_magazine),Empire (magazine),"
Empire is a British film magazine published monthly by Bauer Media Group. The first issue was published in May 1989.
David Hepworth of Emap, the publisher of British music magazines Q and Smash Hits, proposed the idea of launching a film magazine similar to Q.[2][3] They recruited Smash Hits editor Barry McIlheney to edit the new magazine, with Hepworth as Editorial Director.[3] Hepworth drafted a one-page proposal outlining the magazine's objectives, including a commitment to reviewing and rating every film released in UK cinema.[3] The proposal also stated, ""Empire believes that movies can sometimes be art, but they should always be fun.""[2] The first edition (June/July 1989) was published in May 1989, featuring Dennis Quaid and Winona Ryder on the cover for the film Great Balls of Fire!. The magazine achieved its initial sales target of 50,000 copies.[3]
Film reviews were given a star rating between 1 and 5, with no half-stars.[4]
McIlheney served as editor for the first 44 issues, after which assistant editor Phil Thomas, who had been with the magazine since its inception, took over from the March 1993 issue.[2] In 1995, Thomas became managing editor and Q Features Editor Andrew Collins was appointed Empire's editor from issue 73 (July 1995). However, after 3 issues, Collins transitioned to Q following the departure of Danny Kelly, and Empire's Features Editor Mark Salisbury  was promoted to Editor.[5]
In 2006, a compilation of the magazine's film reviews was published as the Empire Film Guide.[4]
In early 2008, Bauer acquired Emap Consumer Media.
Empire has had eleven editors:
Empire reviews both mainstream films and art films, but feature articles concentrate on the former. Ian Freer is a regular reviewer for the magazine.
As well as film news, previews, and reviews, Empire has some other regular features. Each issue (with the exception of issues 108–113) features a Classic Scene, a transcript from a notable film scene. The first such classic scene to be featured was the ""I coulda been a contender"" scene from On the Waterfront.[11]
The Re.View section covers Blu-ray and DVD news and releases. Kim Newman's Movie Dungeon is a regular feature in the Re.View section, in which critic Kim Newman reviews the most obscure releases, mostly low-budget horror movies. Newman has written for Empire since the first issue.[4]
How Much Is A Pint of Milk? presents celebrities' answers to silly or unusual questions, including the question ""How much is a pint of milk?"" This is intended as a guide to the chosen celebrity's contact with reality, and as such can be more informative than a direct interview by reporting some surprising responses. Willem Dafoe was the first interviewee in issue 59 (May 1994).[11]
Each magazine includes a ""Spine Quote"", in which a relatively challenging quote is printed on the spine of the magazine. There are usually some obvious and obscure links from the quote to the main features of that month's edition. Readers are invited to identify the film source and the links to win a prize.
A regular feature since Raging Bull featured in issue 167 (May 2003),[11] the Empire Masterpiece is a two-page essay on a film selected by Empire in the Re.View section. Only a few issues since the first masterpiece feature have not featured one – 179, 196–198 and 246. Issue 241 (June 2009) had director Frank Darabont select 223 masterpieces.[11][12] L.A. Confidential and Magnolia have been featured twice.[citation needed]
Where Are They Now? featuring past film celebrities and updating on their current professional and personal status first appeared in issue 28 (October 1991) featuring Mark Hamill and John Savage.[11]
My Movie Mastermind was another regular in which a celebrity was given questions about the films they were in or directed. Celebrities range from Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Lee (who were at the top of the scoreboard) to John Carpenter and Michael Keaton (who were at the bottom of the scoreboard). The feature first appeared in issue 212 (February 2007) with Terry Gilliam.[11]
In 2001, Empire published a series of guides to the best films by genre including science fiction, horror, crime, action, and comedy.[13]
In 2001, Empire published a special issue on Steven Spielberg as part of The Directors Collection.[14]
Empire published a special 15th anniversary issue in June 2004 by which time the magazine had reviewed 4,240 theatrical films. Nicole Kidman was named ""actress of our lifetime"" and Kevin Spacey was named ""actor of our lifetime"". A list of the 15 most influential films of the preceding 15 years was featured.
As part of its 18th birthday issue published in June 2007 Empire published a list of the top 18-rated moments in film. They also selected the 50 greatest films rated with an 18 certificate.[citation needed]
Empire occasionally polls readers to find out what their favourite films are.
A poll of Empire readers was published in September 2001 and listed Star Wars (1977) as the greatest movie of all time.[15]
In March 2006, a readers' poll of The 201 Greatest Movies of All Time had The Shawshank Redemption (1994) as the number one choice.
The list was selected in September 2008 by over 10,000 Empire readers, 150 filmmakers, and 50 film critics. The list was accompanied by many different covers, each of which went on sale. The list was topped by The Godfather (1972) and the list's most represented director was Steven Spielberg, who had eleven films in the top 500.[16]
In July 2014, during their 25th anniversary year, a readers' poll of The 301 Greatest Movies of All Time was topped by The Empire Strikes Back (1980).[17]
In 2017, Empire surveyed five thousand readers to produce a list of the 100 greatest films ever made which was once again topped by The Godfather.[18]
In 2021, they combined reader votes with Empire critics ""choices"" to create a top 100 list topped by The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.[19]
In June 2005, a poll of 10,000 readers was asked to name the greatest film director of all time. In a list of forty directors, Steven Spielberg was granted the honour of greatest director.
A poll of Empire readers was conducted in 2008 to create a list of the 100 greatest movie characters, with Tyler Durden from Fight Club (1999) listed first.[20]
In June 2015, Empire's readers named the greatest film characters of all time led by Indiana Jones.[21]
Empire launched their first podcast, The Empire Podcast, in March 2012.[22] The podcast is released weekly and is hosted by Chris Hewitt, alongside Helen O'Hara and James Dyer, as well as regularly featuring other Empire journalists such as Amon Warmann, Ben Travis and Terri White. The podcasts feature film news, listener questions, interviews, and reviews, as well as regularly having 'Spoiler Specials' which take an in-depth look at a single film, including plot spoilers. Many of these episodes are included on a separate subscription-only feed that costs £2.99 per month.[23]
In September 2018, Empire launched a second podcast focused on television shows, called The Pilot TV Podcast. It is hosted by James Dyer, Terri White and Boyd Hilton.
In July 2022, the podcast won in the ""Best Live Podcast"" category at the British Podcast Awards following  a live episode held in Kings Place, London to celebrate the podcast’s 500th episode that included returning favourites of lethal cunning, as well as guests such as Brett Goldstein, Tom Holland and Johnny Knoxville.[24][25]
From 1996 until 2018, Empire organised the annual Empire Awards, voted for by readers of the magazine, which were originally sponsored by Sony Ericsson, and from 2009 sponsored by Jameson.[26] The last awards were held in 2018 and after that the awards were discontinued for undisclosed reasons.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page,Main Page,"The African striped weasel (Poecilogale albinucha) is a small mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa, where its range stretches from as far north as Kenya south to South Africa. It belongs to the family Mustelidae and is the lone member of the genus Poecilogale. It has a long, slender body with short legs and a bushy tail. One of the smallest carnivorans in Africa, it measures 24 to 35 cm (9.4 to 13.8 in) long excluding the tail, with males generally larger than females. It has black fur over most of its body, with distinctive white bands running from the top of its head down its back, with the tail being completely white. The closest living relative of this species is the striped polecat, and it may also be related to the extinct Propoecilogale bolti. The African striped weasel is most commonly seen in savanna and veld grasslands with termite mounds, but has also been recorded in semideserts, rainforests, fynbos and even areas used by humans such as pine plantations and agricultural land.

The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne is an oil-on-panel painting by Leonardo da Vinci, painted around 1501 to 1519. It depicts Saint Anne, her daughter the Virgin Mary, and the infant Jesus. Christ is shown grappling with a sacrificial lamb on the edge of a precipice, symbolizing his Passion. It is likely that the painting was commissioned by King Louis XII of France following the birth of his daughter Claude in 1499, but it was never delivered to him. Leonardo explored incorporating these figures together through preparatory works including the Burlington House Cartoon, now in the National Gallery, London, and a drawing which resides in the Louvre, Paris. The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne is also in the Louvre.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Awards,The Game Awards,"
The Game Awards is an annual awards ceremony honoring achievements in the video game industry. Established in 2014, the shows are produced and hosted by game journalist Geoff Keighley. After working on its predecessor, the Spike Video Game Awards, for over ten years, Keighley worked with several video game companies to create the show. In addition to the awards, the Game Awards features premieres of upcoming games and new information on previously-announced titles. The show's reception is generally mixed: it has been lauded for its announcements and criticized for its lack of acknowledgement of events, use of promotional content and treatment of award winners.
The ceremony is held in the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, California.[1] Keighley has declined several offers from television networks to air the show. The Game Awards has a committee composed of representatives of companies such as Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony. They select over a hundred video game press organizations eligible for nomination, and vote on games in the show's categories. Keighley and the committee itself do not participate in voting. Games released before a specific date in November are eligible for nomination. Games released after that date are eligible for the following year's awards. Most winners are determined by a mixed vote from 90% of the voting jury and 10% of fan votes.
In 1994, Canadian games journalist Geoff Keighley had been part of the first televised awards show for video games, Cybermania '94. Keighley, as a teenager, had been brought on to help write material for the celebrity hosts such as William Shatner and Leslie Nielsen. The show was not considered successful, aimed more for comedy than celebration, but it prompted him to develop something akin to the Academy Awards for video games later in his career.[2]
Keighley had subsequently worked on the Spike Video Game Awards (VGA), which ran from 2003 to 2013. The show was broadcast on Spike TV near the end of each calendar year, and was designed to honor video games released during that year. Keighley served as the producer and often host for these shows. While the network had shown strong support for the award show through 2012, having brought Samuel L. Jackson to host the show, Keighley found Spike less interested in pursuing the 2013 show, partially due to the network seeking less male-oriented programming.[3] Spike opted to rename the awards from VGA to VGX as to reflect that they wanted to focus more on next-generation games that were being ushered in by the onset of the eighth generation of consoles, as well as bringing comedian Joel McHale to co-host alongside Keighley.[4] Additionally, the show was reduced to a one-hour presentation, which was first streamed online before airing on television.[3] The 2013 show was considered to be disappointing and aimed as a more commercial work rather than a celebration of video game achievements.[5] Spike offered to continue the show in 2014, but would be limited to streaming media rather than broadcast; Keighley declined,[3] and Spike's show was discontinued.[6]
Keighley worked with several entities within the industry, including console hardware manufacturers Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, and several large publishers, to financially back and craft a new awards show, the Game Awards.[7] He invested around US$1 million of his own personal funds to support the new show,[3] and was able to secure space at The AXIS theater in Las Vegas for hosting the live event. Without a broadcaster, Keighley and the other producers agreed to live stream the show on the consoles' networks and on Valve's Steam service to be able to reach a much larger audience than Spike TV previously had.[8]
Since the 2014 show, Keighley has been able to secure the larger Peacock Theater (formerly Microsoft Theater) in Los Angeles to host the event. He has worked to partner with multiple streaming services around the globe for the show, which has been a move appreciated by several of the Game Awards' partners since the show's inception.[9] Keighley has been approached by broadcast networks offering to air the show, but he had refused these offers, allowing them to keep the freedom of how they present and structure the show.[10] The 2019 show included a simulcast in partnership with Sony Pictures for select Cinemark movie theaters throughout the United States.[11] The Game Awards 2020 was not held in a live theater due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was instead hosted virtually.[12] The 2021 show was held live again at the Microsoft Theater with a reduced audience due to ongoing COVID-19 precautions.[13]
Keighley considered it important that the Game Awards are aimed to favorably present the interest of gamers and the industry at large, as well as being welcoming to celebrities and others that have shown interest in video games.[9] While the Game Awards are principally an awards show, Keighley knew the importance of having additional content, having seen other experiments of video game awards shows that were only dedicated to awards fail due to lack of audience.[14] Keighley believed that the Game Awards should fall somewhere between the entertainment venues that are used for the Academy Awards and the standard award presentation used for the Game Developers Choice Awards, and wanted a balance of material.[9] Through the Spike VGX and into the Game Awards, Keighley has engaged with games studios to bring reveals of new games alongside the awards. He considers the crowning moment of this approach was being able to secure the first gameplay reveal of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild at the Game Awards 2014.[14] Keighly encourages game studios to provide any content that might be deemed exciting or that can pique interest, even if these games are at an early stage of development, and then makes the selection of which games and trailers to feature.[14] Keighley subsequently works with those studios about how to best position their trailers to have the most impact; for example, in the 2018 show, he and Nintendo worked on a trailer reveal for the Persona 5 character Joker in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate that appeared to start as a teaser for a new game in the series.[15][16]
Since the show's launch, Keighley has solicited input from fans on how to improve the show, typically while at trade shows and conventions in months ahead of the show. For 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing cancellations of many of these events, Keighley invited about one hundred fans to private chats with himself and other top organizers of the program to help solicit their input.[17] The Game Awards were still held in 2020 and 2021, though with a limited invited audience for the latter and limited interactions of hosts, presenters and nominees due to restrictions set by California and Los Angeles in regards to large gatherings in indoor spaces. The 2022 show returned to a full live audience as these government restrictions were since lifted.[18]
In conjunction with the show, digital storefronts such as Steam, Xbox Games Store, Nintendo eShop, and PlayStation Store offer the nominated games on sale leading up to and a few days after the event.[19] The statuette awarded to the selected games was designed by collaboration between Keighley and Weta Workshop. It is meant to represent ""the evolution of the video game medium by way of an angel that ascends through digital building blocks"".[20][21] In 2019, a Game Festival featuring demos of upcoming games was held on Steam.[22] In 2021, Keighley hosted the podcast Inside the Game Awards in partnership with Spotify.[23] In June 2023, Keighley hosted The Game Awards 10-Year Celebration, a performance of video game music at the Hollywood Bowl by the Los Angeles Philharmonic.[24]
The Game Awards has an advisory committee which includes representatives from hardware manufacturers Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, and AMD, along with several game publishers. This committee selects game news organizations that are able to nominate and subsequently vote on the video games in several categories. The advisory committee otherwise does not participate in the nomination or voting process. During the nomination round, each of the news outlets provides a list of games in several categories; games for the esports-related categories are chosen by a specific subset of these outlets. The committee compiles the nominations and selects the most-nominated games for voting by these same outlets.[36] Prior to 2017, there were 28 industry experts and representatives that selected the winners, while the awards from 2017 onwards have used over 50 such experts.[37] In 2019, non-English media publications were added to the jury.[38] As of 2024, there are over one hundred media publications around the world that were chosen as juries. Winners are determined by a blended vote between the voting jury (90%) and public fan voting (10%) via social platforms and the show's website.[39]
Generally, only games released before a specific date in November are eligible for being nominated in the year's awards. As the jury must make their nominations in the weeks prior to this date, this may leave some anticipated games that are scheduled for release just before that date to be underrepresented in the nominations, since the jury must go by pre-release review copies and not the final version.[40] Any games releasing after the November deadline (which varies every year) are eligible for the next year's ceremony.[41] Game expansions, seasonal content, downloadable content, remakes, and remasters are also eligible across all award categories.[42]
The show has received praise for its announcements.[70] However, commentators have criticized the Game Awards for being overly promotional and commercialized.[71][72][73] The ratio of time spent on honoring awards winners compared to advertisements for upcoming games is a common point of criticism.[74][75][76] After news of Activision Blizzard's sexual misconduct scandal broke, Keighley opened the 2021 awards show with a statement denouncing abuse in the industry.[77] The statement was criticized for failing to refer to Activision Blizzard by name and appearing to be designed to preserve ""valuable industry relationships"" over taking a more meaningful stance.[78][79] The incident raised questions about the show's close relationship with the industry and unwillingness to paint business partners in a bad light.[76] The 2023 ceremony was criticized for allowing celebrity guests several minutes to speak while winners were allocated thirty seconds before being prompted to ""wrap it up"" and cut off by music.[80][81][82]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(2019_TV_series),Manhunt (2019 TV series),"
Manhunt is a British television drama based on murder investigations. The first series focused on the true story surrounding the investigation into the death of French student Amélie Delagrange. The subsequent manhunt eventually led to the arrest of Levi Bellfield for Delagrange's murder, and several other high profile, yet previously unsolved cases.[1][2][3]
The series was first shown in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2019, airing on three consecutive nights. Consolidated figures show an average of 8.7 million viewers across the three episodes, rising further to 9 million viewers when online viewing is included. This made the series ITV's highest rated launch of a new drama series since the first series of Broadchurch in 2013.[4]  The series has so far won two BAFTA Cymru awards: Best Director, Fiction for Marc Evans, and Best Actor for Celyn Jones.[5] On 6 March 2019, the show was renewed for a second series which premiered on 20 September 2021.
On the evening of 19 August 2004, a young woman has been attacked on Twickenham Green, in the south-west of Greater London. The victim, identified as Amélie Delagrange, is a 22-year-old French student visiting the UK. She dies in hospital from serious head injuries.
Metropolitan Police select Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton to lead a large task force as Senior Investigating Officer. No forensic evidence can be procured from the scene, and there are no links in Delagrange's past that could indicate a motive. There have been several previous attacks and murders of young women in the area, and within 24 hours, the  investigation establishes that she might have been killed by the same person who killed Marsha McDonnell on 3 February 2003.
Cell tower data indicates Delagrange's phone last made contact to the network in an area close by the river, several miles from the green where she was found. Despite pressure to send divers elsewhere, Sutton insists on dredging the river (Thames) by the nearest car crossing, Walton Bridge, and finally finds the phone and other items owned by the victim. Again resisting doubts, this time from within his own team, Sutton decides to employ a significant portion of his team to survey CCTV footage from the night of the attack. A suspicious white van moving around at the time of the attack is found, but it cannot be readily identified since there are over 25,000 similar vans in the UK.
When Sutton prioritizes the case over his personal life, missing out on holidays and birthdays, he and his wife Louise argue over possible links to a similar case involving the murder of Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old girl in Surrey, where Louise works as a police analyst. She reveals that her superiors, aware of her link to Sutton, have forbidden her to discuss that case with him.
A WPC who attended the initial crime scene reminds Sutton about a witness report of the day, leading him to a possible suspect named Levi Bellfield, a self-employed vehicle clamping operator. He is known to be violent, and very aggressive to the numerous women in his life; and that he owns several vehicles, including a white van.
Sutton scales back a nationwide search for the van, and instead mounts a comprehensive surveillance operation on Bellfield. It soon becomes clear he actively approaches girls and young women, scaring them. The team learns that he once owned a white people-carrier of a similar description to one used to run over and nearly kill a young woman, named Sarah Knight. They also learn he once lived very close to the site of the Surrey murder. It becomes clear to Sutton that Bellfield is not only their man, but that he is likely to strike again. Sutton only lets the Surrey Police officer DCI Marjoram, previously in charge of the Milly Dowler case, who he visits privately at home so there can be no leak to the press, know about Bellfield. He swears Marjoram to silence.
A large operation is drawn up to facilitate Bellfield's arrest and at the same time to strike at the addresses of known associates to prevent the loss of possible forensic evidence. But out of the blue a leak to the press alerts the News of the World, a large sensationalist tabloid in the UK, which plans to run a story of the impending operation well before Sutton and his team are ready. This would alert Bellfield who might well ""do a runner"". To make the News of the World postpone its story, the investigating team agree to let a journalist and photographer join the operation to get first-hand access to the bust.
At first, due to the leak, it seems Bellfield has given them the slip, but his current partner Laura Marsh soon reveals he is hiding in the attic, and he is safely apprehended. This gives Sutton and his team just 72 hours before they must charge him with a crime or set him free. With insufficient evidence to link Bellfield to the vehicles used in the various murders at specific times and places, they enlist the cooperation of Marsh to detain Bellfield on a charge of assaulting and raping her, giving them time to keep building their murder charge. At his bail hearing, Bellfield displays his violent temper when he learns he will be incarcerated at Milton Keynes, located well outside London.
Finally receiving the support of investigators working on the Milly Dowler case, the team find CCTV evidence tying Bellfield to that case, evidence that had previously been overlooked. Realizing that Amélie Delagrange might not have been murdered had the evidence been found earlier, Sutton travels to France to apologize to her parents.
Finally, again with Laura Marsh's assistance, the investigators find a supermarket receipt that backs up her story about Bellfield on the day of Amélie’s murder and also him being alone in their previous home, very close to the site of the Milly Dowler disappearance, on the very day of that crime. The series ends with the prosecutor finally being satisfied by the available evidence and deciding to charge Bellfield with the murder of Delagrange, as well as the hit-and-run of Sarah Knight, with the murder of Marsha McDonnell to hopefully follow.
An ending note informs the viewer that on 25 February 2008 Levi Bellfield was convicted of the murders of Marsha McDonnell and Amélie Delagrange and the attempted murder of Sarah Knight, and sentenced to three life sentences with a recommendation to never be released from prison. Furthermore, that on 23 June 2011, Bellfield was found guilty of the murder of Milly Dowler, and sentenced to a second life imprisonment.
The second series focuses on the search for serial rapist Delroy Grant.
It begins with a daughter checking up on her mother. She is found hiding inside her cabinet wailing.
17 years later in 2009, Sutton is being called up again New Scotland Yard. He is tasked with reviewing a 17-year ongoing serial rape case, Operation Minstead.
The series is written by screenwriter Ed Whitmore, based on the memoirs of real-life former Met police detective DCI Colin Sutton.[6]
On 6 March 2019, the show was renewed for a second series, initially to premiere in 2020.[7] The second series was confirmed by ITV in November 2020, with a premiere date of 20 September 2021.[8]
British newspapers posted reviews after the first episode. The Guardian praised the scripting together with the ""fine work...fleetness and lightness of touch"" of Clunes's performance.[9] The Sunday Times said that ""The art of telling true stories without resorting to sensation or cliché was expertly showcased by Manhunt, a deftly constructed three-part dramatisation of the 2004 police pursuit of London serial killer Levi Bellfield"".
US media reviewed the series in its entirety a month later. The Hollywood Reporter has this to say: ""In Manhunt, there's something likably precise in the old-school focus on how much boring paperwork, staff-wide effort and luck goes into piecing together a complex case,"" and considers it ""keenly British"".[10] The New York Times called it ""The hit of the year in Britain so far"".[11]
The series won two BAFTA Cymru awards: Best Director, Fiction for Marc Evans, and Best Actor for Celyn Jones, and was also a finalist in the C21 International Drama Awards for Best Mini Series.  Script Writer Ed Whitmore has been nominated for a Mystery Writers of America 2020 Edgar Award for Best Television Episode Teleplay.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order:_UK,Law & Order: UK,"
Law & Order: UK (stylised as Law & Order | UK) is a British police procedural and legal television programme broadcast from 2009 to 2014 on ITV, adapted from the American series Law & Order. Financed by the production companies Kudos Film and Television, Wolf Films, and Universal Television,[1] the series originally starred Bradley Walsh, Freema Agyeman, Jamie Bamber, Ben Daniels, Harriet Walter and Bill Paterson. Dominic Rowan, Georgia Taylor, Paul Nicholls, Ben Bailey Smith, Sharon Small, Peter Davison and Paterson Joseph joined the cast in later series. This is the first American drama television series to be adapted for British television,[2] while the episodes are adapted from scripts and episodes of the parent series.
Series 1 was broadcast in 2009. In June 2014, broadcaster ITV and producer Kudos issued a joint press release announcing that series 8 would be ""the last to be transmitted for the foreseeable future.""[3]
In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups: the police who investigate crime, and the Crown Prosecutors who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories.
Law & Order: UK is a British adaptation of the American television series Law & Order, one of the most successful brands in American primetime television.[1] Law & Order: UK is based in London and duplicates the episode format of the original series but with appropriate modifications to more closely resemble the English legal system.
The first half of each episode focuses on the perpetration of a crime and the related police investigation, typically culminating in an arrest. The second half follows the legal and court proceedings in an effort to convict the suspect.[4] The show dwells little on the characters' back-stories or social lives, focusing mainly on their lives at work.[5]
The opening narration is largely the same as that of the American series, but replaces ""district attorneys"" with ""crown prosecutors"".
For most of Law & Order: UK's run, the lead-in of the show began with the discovery of a crime, usually a murder. The scene typically begins with a slice of everyday life in London, perhaps in a fish and chip shop or Indian takeaway. Some civilians would then discover the crime victim, or sometimes the crime would occur in a public place with civilians as victims or witnesses.
The police are represented in the show by Metropolitan Police Service Murder Investigation Unit (referred to as MIU), with two Criminal Investigation Department (CID) detectives, both detective sergeants (DSs), who report directly to their boss, a detective inspector (DI) or detective chief inspector (DCI). During the preliminary crime scene examination, the detectives make their first observations, form initial theories, and engage in witty banter before the title sequence begins.
The detectives often have few or no good clues, and might not even know the victim's identity, but must usually chase several dead ends before finding a likely suspect. They begin by collecting evidence at the crime scene, often receiving a briefing from scenes of crime officers (SOCOs) who have already conducted a preliminary investigation. They visit the forensic pathologist for information about cause and time of death, or about the victim's identity from dental records or fingerprints. The police will also inform relatives, interview witnesses, and trace the victim's last known movements by talking to the victim's family, friends, co-workers, or known associates.  They will visit the crime laboratory for evidence such as fingerprints, DNA and ballistics results.  They will receive information from colleagues who have checked the financial and criminal records of both victims and suspects. In some instances, psychologists or psychiatrists are called in for insight into the criminal's personality, behaviour or modus operandi. The detectives then report to their commanding officer who advises or directs them on how best to proceed. For example, when suspects have been identified, the commanding officer decides if there is enough for a search or arrest warrant, perhaps after consulting the CPS office to see if the case is strong enough; and whether any back-up from uniformed officers or armed police is needed. The detectives will then arrest the suspects, sometimes after a chase through the streets of London. The scene then shifts to the interrogation room where the detectives interview the suspect(s) until the latter request(s) a solicitor, who then arrives to typically advise the suspect to remain silent; and then from the interrogation room to the offices of the Crown Prosecution Service, where crown prosecutors decide if they have enough to press charges.
Towards the middle of a show, the police will begin to work with the prosecutors to make the arrest, though sometimes the CPS team will on occasion appear early on to arrange a plea-for-information deal or to decide if the detectives have enough evidence for search warrants and/or arrest warrants before arresting the suspect or suspects and an arraignment scene will follow.
The matter then is taken over by a pair of crown prosecutors, a crown prosecutor sometimes referred to as a chief crown prosecutor and a crown prosecutor sometimes referred to as a crown advocate from the London 
office of the Crown Prosecution Service. They discuss deals, prepare the witnesses and evidence, and conduct the Crown's case in the trial. The crown prosecutors work together and with the coroner's office, the crime laboratory (including fingerprint analysts, DNA profilers and Ballistics analysts), and psychologists and/or psychiatrists (if the defendant uses an insanity plea) all of whom may be needed to testify in court for the prosecution. The police may also reappear to testify in court or to arrest another suspect, but most investigation in the second segment is done by the CPS office, who always consult with the local London CPS Director for advice on the case. If the case is very weak then the police would re-investigate.
Unlike many legal dramas (e.g. Kavanagh QC and Rumpole of the Bailey), the court proceedings are shown from the prosecution's point of view, with the regular characters trying to prove the defendant's guilt, not innocence. The prosecution usually opens with the arraignment of defendants and proceeds to trial preparation, including legal research and plea negotiations. Some episodes include legal proceedings beyond the testimony of witnesses, including motion hearings (often concerning admissibility of evidence); jury selection; and allocutions, usually as a result of plea bargains. Many episodes employ motions to suppress evidence as a plot device, and most of these end with evidence or statements being suppressed, often on a technicality. This usually begins with the service of the motion to the CPS team, follows with argument and case citations of precedent before a judge in court, and concludes with visual reaction of the winning or losing attorney.  In some episodes, the audience may not explicitly see the final verdict of the trial or outcomes of any ensuing legal agreements.  If the CPS loses a case against a defendant, the episode may occasionally show the CPS pursuing additional charges against the said defendant.
Many episodes use outlandish defence scenarios such as diminished responsibility (e.g. ""genetics""/""television""/""God""/""the devil made me do it"" and intoxication defence) and temporary insanity (e.g. ""black rage""/""white rage""/""sports rage""). Some episodes revolve around moral and ethical debates, including the right to die (euthanasia), the right to life (abortion) and the right to bear arms (gun control). The episode usually ends with the verdict being read by the jury foreperson and a shot of both the winning and losing parties. The scene then shifts to the Crown Prosecution Service's London office where the team is leaving the office to go home while contemplating either the true guilt of the accused, the defence scenarios they used or the moral or ethical debate of the episode.
Law & Order: UK was first imagined by franchise creator Dick Wolf in 2000; however, at the time, no network was willing to pick up a pilot for the series.[6][failed verification] Wolf managed to attract scriptwriter Chris Chibnall, who had previously worked on British productions Torchwood, Life on Mars and Born and Bred, to write a series of 13 adaptations from the original Law & Order series. Wolf then asked Chibnall to look through the Law & Order Bible, a book released in the United States containing a collection of synopses for every episode. Chibnall picked 13 episodes that could be adapted for British television, watched the originals on DVD, and then wrote the adaptations to accommodate contractual requirements with production company Kudos, and to build on the show's reputation of successful storytelling. Subsequently, the series was picked up by ITV. One of the episodes Chibnall adapted, however, had to be scrapped because of incompatibility with English law, resulting in a different episode being adapted.[6][failed verification] Wolf then attracted producer Richard Stokes to the series, but he stated that a 13-episode series would be too long for broadcast on British television, and thus, he separated the 13 scripts into two separate series. Wolf, however, objected to this, claiming that it wouldn't be an issue, as each series in the United States contains 22 episodes per series. Wolf pushed ITV for more episodes per series, but his attempt was unsuccessful. Each of the 13 scripts was updated for contemporariness, and while the difficulties of adapting the scripts for the English legal system exceeded the expectations of the production team, Stokes opined that audiences familiar with both shows would enjoy them for their distinctions. Further series have continued to adapt scripts from the original Law & Order series. Many of the familiar hallmarks of the original Law & Order series were carried through into the adaptation, including the styling of the opening music, black-and-white intertitles, using Wolf's signature ""clanging cell door"" sound, and hand-held camera work. Stokes later expressed his praise for the Kudos' method of guerrilla filming on the streets of London.[7] Wolf later described the biggest difference between the two series as the wigs, claiming: ""The law is not really that dissimilar and, you know, murder is murder.""[8][9]
In August 2012, ITV announced that they had renewed the show for a six-episode seventh series. Due to other commitments, neither Harriet Walter nor Freema Agyeman returned, and they were replaced by Paterson Joseph and Georgia Taylor in the roles of Detective Inspector Wes Layton and Crown Prosecutor Kate Barker respectively.[10] On 27 February 2013, it was confirmed that Paul Nicholls who plays Detective Sergeant Sam Casey would be leaving the series in the sixth episode of Series 7.[11] On 8 April 2014, it was confirmed that Paterson Joseph would be leaving the series, with his character to be killed in episode 7 of series 8.[12] He was replaced by Sharon Small as DI Elizabeth Flynn in episode 8. On 3 June 2014, ITV confirmed that Bradley Walsh had declined a contract option to return for a ninth series; simultaneously the show was retired indefinitely.[13]
The first series of Law & Order: UK starred Bradley Walsh, Jamie Bamber and Harriet Walter, Ben Daniels, Freema Agyeman and Bill Paterson. Each commission consisted of six-seven episodes. Series one was broadcast in February 2009 and concluded in April 2009, with seven episodes being broadcast. The second series followed in January 2010 and consisted of six episodes.
The next three series were all broadcast throughout 2010 with series 2 airing between January and February followed by series 3 between September and October with series 4 airing between November and December. The first major cast departures came at the end of the fourth series, with Ben Daniels and Bill Paterson leaving the show. Walsh, Bamber, Walter, and Agyeman all remained in their roles.
Series 5 introduced two major new cast members in Dominic Rowan as Crown Prosecutor Jacob Thorne and Peter Davison as Henry Sharpe, taking over from Ben Daniels and Bill Paterson respectively. It was also the final series to feature Jamie Bamber, whose character DS Matt Devlin was killed off in the sixth and final episode.
Series 6 introduced Devlin's replacement, DS Sam Casey played by Paul Nicholls. Series 6 was also the last to feature Freema Agyeman as junior prosecutor Alesha Phillips and Harriet Walter as DI Natalie Chandler, though she would later return for the fourth episode of Series 8.
The show returned after a longer break between series with a further 7 episodes for its seventh and penultimate series.
This featured two further cast changes with the introduction of Paterson Joseph as DI Wes Layton and Georgia Taylor as junior prosecutor Kate Barker, replacing Harriet Walter and Freema Agyeman, respectively.
It was also the last series to feature Paul Nicholls as DS Sam Casey, who departed in the final episode due to Nicholls having other commitments. He was replaced by Ben Bailey Smith in Series 8.
The show returned in the spring of 2014 for an eighth series featuring a final run of eight episodes.
It featured the final major cast change with the introduction of Ben Bailey Smith as DS Joe Hawkins.
In June 2014, ITV announced the show would take an indefinite hiatus with Bradley Walsh opting to quit the show, despite originally having outlined stories for a ninth series.
In Canada and the United States, for series 1–3, each thirteen-episode run was transmitted as a single series, meaning a total of three seasons had been broadcast as of 2012.[14]
On 30 April 2014, the final episode of series 5 was due to air at 9:00 but was pulled from broadcast hours prior due to the storyline's similarity to the murder of British teacher Ann Maguire in the same week.[15] The episode was instead due to be shown on the later date of 11 June 2014.[16]
Filming on the first series of Law & Order: UK began in January 2008,[17] and after completion, ITV cutbacks were a concern for cast member Jamie Bamber, who in an interview with Metro, stated, ""I think it will [return], but I don't know because as you know there are cutbacks on ITV.""[18] However, ITV commissioned a further thirteen episodes, and filming began in the third quarter of 2009.[19] These episodes were subsequently broadcast from 9 September 2010.[20] For the Law part of the series, frequent filming on-location around London takes place, while for the Order part, filming around the exterior of the Old Bailey takes place concurrently on Sundays. Filming of the courtroom interior, police station office and the Crown Prosecution Service office takes place on a specially built set on a disused Ministry of Defence base in Qinetiq,[21] based near the M25 motorway in Surrey.[22] The police station set was specifically designed with an eye for realism; with personal items on each of the desks, and an ironing board and clean shirts being placed around for the eventuality of police officers heading to court. The campus of University College London, including the main quadrangle and the cloisters, was used for the basis of filming for scenes aired in series six.[8][failed verification]
The original cast of Law & Order: UK consisted of Bradley Walsh as Sergeant Ronnie Brooks, Jamie Bamber as Sergeant Matt Devlin, and Harriet Walter as Inspector Natalie Chandler, Ben Daniels as Prosecutor James Steel, Freema Agyeman as Solicitor Alesha Phillips, and Bill Paterson as Director George Castle. Bamber was subsequently replaced by Paul Nicholls as Sergeant Sam Casey, and later Ben Bailey-Smith as Sergeant Joe Hawkins, while Walter was succeeded by Paterson Joseph as Inspector Wes Layton, and Sharon Small as Inspector Elisabeth Flynn. Similarly, both Georgia Taylor and Dominic Rowan would succeed Agyeman and Daniels, respectively, as Prosecutors Kate Barker and Jake Thorne, whilst Paterson was succeeded by Peter Davison, as Director Henry Sharpe.
Original cast member Walsh left the cast prior to a potential ninth series, though ITV's decision to place the show on hiatus after the series 8 finale leaves Walsh's departure a moot point, and as such he remains the only actor to appear throughout the entire run of the series.
In the United Kingdom, Law & Order: UK is broadcast on ITV with repeats of the series airing on sister channel ITV3. In Ireland, TV3 broadcasts each episode a day after the British airing, however, the series is billed as Law & Order: London to distinguish itself from the original American series.[23]
In Canada, City began broadcasting the series on 11 June 2009[24] and
in Australia, Network Ten began broadcasting the series in August 2009.[25][26] It was later moved to 13th Street, which will premiere the fifth season on 4 February 2015.[27]
In the United States, the series began broadcasting on BBC America on 3 October 2010. Series 1–4 were shown back-to-back as were series 5–6.[28][29] In the United States, series 7 was broadcast as a 6-episode season 4; no date has been announced for the American broadcast of series 8/season 5.
The series also broadcasts in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and New Zealand.[30]
Independent writer Robin Jarossi, who attended a special preview of the premiere episode at the British Film Institute in London on 5 February 2009, praised the uniquely British take on the franchise for balancing the new vision while maintaining the proven Law & Order formula. Jarossi specifically extolled the unexpected casting of Bradley Walsh, the excellent use of their London backdrop, and Chibnall's adaptation of the show.[31] John Boland of the Irish Independent compared Law & Order: UK to the original, ultimately deciding that the former is just as engrossing as the latter, if its tone is slightly more jocular. Boland expects ITV ""has a winner on its hands.""[32] Andrew Billen from The Times expects the series to be successful based on the premiere episode,[33] and TV Times said that ""those concerned can give themselves a pat on the back because this really, really works.""[34] The Daily Express' Matt Baylis described the new series as ""a breath of fresh air"", and the Daily Mirror said ""It's all highly professional and heroic.""[2]
Variety magazine called the series a hit, quoting NBC Universal as saying, ""Law & Order has won its slot every week and is actually increasing its ratings."" While Radio Times reviewer Alison Graham felt the series' execution was adequate, she criticised its pacing and writing; the former for not matching that of the original Law & Order programmes, and the latter for ""falling headfirst into a typically British legal-drama trap of the noble prosecutor, crusading to bring the guilty to justice while pitted against the louche, self-serving defence barrister.""[35] Whereas, on the other hand, The Guardian's Sarah Dempster didn't feel that using the original series' camera work and stylings was appropriate for British crime drama: ""Fiddly. And wrong.""[2] However, later on in the series' run The Observer's Kathryn Flytt writes that despite her initial prejudices, the series ""seems to have absorbed the pace and energy of the original without looking too tricksily derivative"".[36] In Australia, Melinda Houston commented favourably in The Age on the show's opening series, opining that the fusion between British crime drama and the American Law & Order franchise is like ""a match made in Heaven.""[37] The premiere episode which aired on 12 August 2009, only rated 775,000 viewers, and was outside the top 15 rated shows for that period.[38]
Barrister Caroline Haughey, a self-confessed crime junkie, said that Law & Order: UK made her cry:
the relationship between the officers and CPS was reasonably fair; however, the conduct of the Crown Prosecution Advocate in his talking directly to defendants and offering plea bargains was a step too far.  Law And Order State Side is excellent, but the translation of that justice system into our own jurisdiction is not really possible – CPS lawyers do NOT invite defendants to CPS HQ, and do not run their own investigation.[39]The final Series 8 (Episodes 46 to 53) has not been released on DVD since transmission in 2014.

Nintendo Co., Ltd.[c] is a Japanese multinational video game company headquartered in Kyoto. It develops, publishes, and releases both video games and video game consoles.
The history of Nintendo began when craftsman Fusajiro Yamauchi founded the company to produce handmade hanafuda playing cards. After venturing into various lines of business and becoming a public company, Nintendo began producing toys in the 1960s, and later video games. Nintendo developed its first arcade games in the 1970s, and distributed its first system, the Color TV-Game in 1977. The company became internationally dominant in the 1980s after the arcade release of Donkey Kong (1981) and the Nintendo Entertainment System, which launched outside of Japan alongside Super Mario Bros. in 1985.
Since then, Nintendo has produced some of the most successful consoles in the video game industry, including the Game Boy (1989), the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (1991), the Nintendo DS (2004), the Wii (2006), and the Nintendo Switch (2017). It has created or published numerous major franchises, including Mario, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda, Animal Crossing, and Pokémon. The company's mascot, Mario, is among the most famous fictional characters, and Nintendo's other characters—including Luigi, Donkey Kong, Samus, Link, Kirby, and Pikachu—have attained international recognition. Several films and a theme park area based on the company's franchises have been created.
Nintendo's game consoles have sold over 860 million units worldwide as of May 2025, for which more than 5.9 billion individual games have been sold. The company has numerous subsidiaries in Japan and worldwide, in addition to second-party developers including HAL Laboratory, Intelligent Systems, and Game Freak. It is one of the wealthiest and most valuable companies in the Japanese market.Nintendo was founded as Nintendo Koppai[d] on 23 September 1889[6] by craftsman Fusajiro Yamauchi in Shimogyō-ku, Kyoto, Japan, as an unincorporated establishment, to produce and distribute Japanese playing cards, or karuta (かるた; from Portuguese carta, 'card'), most notably hanafuda (花札, 'flower cards').[1][2][3][7][8][9] The name ""Nintendo"" is commonly assumed to mean ""leave luck to heaven"",[9][10] but the assumption lacks historical validation; it has also been suggested to mean ""the temple of free hanafuda"", but even descendants of Yamauchi do not know the true intended meaning of the name.[7] Hanafuda cards had become popular after Japan banned most forms of gambling in 1882, though tolerated hanafuda. Sales of hanafuda cards were popular with the yakuza-run gaming parlors in Kyoto. Other card manufacturers had opted to leave the market, not wanting to be associated with its criminality, but Yamauchi persisted despite such fears to become the primary producer of hanafuda within a few years.[11] With the increase of the cards' popularity, Yamauchi hired assistants to mass-produce them to satisfy the demand.[12] Even with a favorable start, the business faced financial struggles due to operating in a niche market, the slow and expensive manufacturing process, high product price, alongside long durability of the cards, which impacted sales due to the low replacement rate.[13] As a solution, Nintendo produced a cheaper and lower-quality line of playing cards, Tengu, while also conducting product offerings in other cities such as Osaka, where card game profits were high. In addition, local merchants were interested in the prospect of continuous renewal of decks, thus avoiding the suspicions that reusing cards would generate.[14]
According to Nintendo, the business' first western-style card deck was put on the market in 1902,[2][3] although other documents indicate the date was 1907, shortly after the Russo-Japanese War.[15] Although the cards were initially intended to be exported, they quickly gained popularity within and without Japan.[2][3] During this time, the business styled itself as Marufuku Nintendo Card Co.[16] The war created considerable difficulties for companies in the leisure sector, which were subject to new levies such as the Karuta Zei (""playing cards tax"").[17] Nintendo subsisted and, in 1907, entered into an agreement with Nihon Senbai—later known as the Japan Tobacco—to market its cards to various cigarette stores throughout the country.[18] A Nintendo promotional calendar from the Taishō era dated to 1915 indicates that the business was named Yamauchi Nintendo[e] but still used the Marufuku Nintendo Co. brand for its playing cards.[19]
Japanese culture stipulated that for Nintendo to continue as a family business after Yamauchi's retirement, Yamauchi had to adopt his son-in-law so that he could take over the business. As a result, Sekiryo Kaneda adopted the Yamauchi surname in 1907 and headed the business in 1929. By that time, Nintendo was the largest playing card business in Japan.[20]
In 1933, Sekiryo Kaneda established the company as a general partnership named Yamauchi Nintendo & Co., Ltd.[f][3] investing in the construction of a new corporate headquarters located next to the original building,[21] near the Toba-kaidō train station.[22] Because Sekiryo's marriage to Yamauchi's daughter produced no male heirs, he planned to adopt his son-in-law Shikanojo Inaba, an artist in the company's employ and the father of his grandson Hiroshi, born in 1927. However, Inaba abandoned his family and the company, so Hiroshi was made Sekiryo's eventual successor.[23]
World War II negatively impacted the company as Japanese authorities prohibited the diffusion of foreign card games, and as the priorities of Japanese society shifted, its interest in recreational activities waned. During this time, Nintendo was partly supported by a financial injection from Hiroshi's wife Michiko Inaba, who came from a wealthy family.[24] In 1947, Sekiryo founded the distribution company Marufuku Co., Ltd.[g] responsible for Nintendo's sales and marketing operations, which would eventually go on to become the present-day Nintendo Co., Ltd., in Higashikawara-cho, Imagumano, Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto.[2][3][7]
In 1950, due to Sekiryo's deteriorating health,[25] Hiroshi Yamauchi assumed the presidency and headed manufacturing operations.[2][3] His first actions involved several important changes in the operation of the company: in 1951, he changed the company name to Nintendo Playing Card Co., Ltd.[h][2][3][26] and in the following year, he centralized the manufacturing facilities dispersed in Kyoto, which led to the expansion of the offices in Kamitakamatsu-cho, Fukuine, Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto.[2][3][27] In 1953, Nintendo became the first company to succeed in mass-producing plastic playing cards in Japan.[2][3] Some of the company's employees, accustomed to more cautious and conservative leadership, viewed the new measures with concern, and the rising tension led to a call for a strike. However, the measure had no major impact, as Hiroshi resorted to the dismissal of several dissatisfied workers.[28]
In 1959, Nintendo moved its headquarters to Kamitakamatsu-cho, Fukuine, Higashiyama-ku in Kyoto. The company entered into a partnership with Walt Disney Productions to incorporate its characters into playing cards, which opened it up to the children's market and resulted in a boost to Nintendo's playing card business.[2][3][26] Nintendo automated the production of Japanese playing cards using backing paper, and also developed a distribution system that allowed it to offer its products in toy stores.[2][21] By 1961, the company had established a Tokyo branch in Chiyoda, Tokyo,[2] and sold more than 1.5 million card packs, holding a high market share, for which it relied on televised advertising campaigns.[29] In 1962, Nintendo became a public company by listing stock on the second section of the Osaka Securities Exchange and the Kyoto Stock Exchange.[2][3] In the following year, the company adopted its current name, Nintendo & Co., Ltd.[i] and started manufacturing games in addition to playing cards.[2][3]
In 1964, Nintendo earned ¥150 million.[30] Although the company experienced a period of economic prosperity, the Disney cards and derived products made it dependent on the children's market. The situation was exacerbated by the falling sales of its adult-oriented playing cards caused by Japanese society gravitating toward other hobbies such as pachinko, bowling, and nightly outings.[29] When Disney card sales began to decline, Nintendo realized that it had no real alternative to alleviate the situation.[30] After the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Nintendo's stock price plummeted to its lowest recorded level of ¥60.[31][32]
In 1965, Nintendo hired Gunpei Yokoi to maintain the assembly-line machines used to manufacture its playing cards.[33]
Yamauchi increased Nintendo's investment in a research and development department in 1969, directed by Hiroshi Imanishi, a long-time employee of the company. Yokoi was moved to the newly created department and was responsible for coordinating various projects.[3][34] Yokoi's experience in manufacturing electronic devices led Yamauchi to put him in charge of the company's games department, and his products would be mass-produced.[35] During that period, Nintendo built a new production plant in Uji, just outside of Kyoto,[3] and distributed classic tabletop games like chess, shogi, go, and mahjong, and other foreign games under the Nippon Game brand.[36] The company's restructuring preserved a couple of areas dedicated to playing card manufacturing.[37]
In 1970, the company's stock listing was promoted to the first section of the Osaka Stock Exchange,[2][3] and the reconstruction and enlargement of its corporate headquarters was completed.[3] The year represented a watershed moment in Nintendo's history as it released Japan's first electronic toy—the Beam Gun, an optoelectronic pistol designed by Masayuki Uemura.[3] In total, more than a million units were sold.[38] Nintendo partnered with Magnavox to provide a light gun controller based on the Beam Gun design for the company's new home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, in 1971.[39] Other popular toys released at the time included the Ultra Hand, the Ultra Machine, the Ultra Scope, and the Love Tester, all designed by Yokoi. More than 1.2 million units of Ultra Hand were sold in Japan.[12]
The growing demand for Nintendo's products led Yamauchi to further expand the offices, for which he acquired the surrounding land and assigned the production of cards to the original Nintendo building. Meanwhile, Yokoi, Uemura, and new employees such as Genyo Takeda continued to develop innovative products for the company.[21] The Laser Clay Shooting System was released in 1973 and managed to surpass bowling in popularity. Though Nintendo's toys continued to gain popularity, the 1973 oil crisis caused both a spike in the cost of plastics and a change in consumer priorities that put essential products over pastimes, and Nintendo lost several billion yen.[40]
In 1974, Nintendo released Wild Gunman, a skeet shooting arcade simulation consisting of a 16 mm image projector with a sensor that detects a beam from the player's light gun. Both the Laser Clay Shooting System and Wild Gunman were successfully exported to Europe and North America.[3] However, Nintendo's production speeds were still slow compared to rival companies such as Bandai and Tomy, and their prices were high, which led to the discontinuation of some of their light gun products.[41] The subsidiary Nintendo Leisure System Co., Ltd., which developed these products, was closed as a result of the economic impact dealt by the oil crisis.[42]
Yamauchi, motivated by the successes of Atari and Magnavox with their video game consoles,[21] acquired the Japanese distribution rights for the Magnavox Odyssey in 1974,[35] and reached an agreement with Mitsubishi Electric to develop similar products between 1975 and 1978, including the first microprocessor for video games systems, the Color TV-Game series, and an arcade game inspired by Othello.[3] During this period, Takeda developed the video game EVR Race,[43] and Shigeru Miyamoto joined Yokoi's team with the responsibility of designing the casing for the Color TV-Game consoles.[44] In 1978, Nintendo's research and development department was split into two facilities, Nintendo Research & Development 1 and Nintendo Research & Development 2, respectively managed by Yokoi and Uemura.[45][46]
Shigeru Miyamoto brought distinctive sources of inspiration to the company, ranging from the natural environment and regional culture of Sonobe, to popular culture influences like Westerns and detective fiction, and to folk Shinto practices and family media.[47][48][49][50] They are seen in most of Nintendo's major franchises which developed following Miyamoto's creative leadership.[51]
By the late 1970s, Nintendo was struggling financially.[52] Two key events in Nintendo's history occurred in 1979: its American subsidiary was opened in New York City, and a new department focused on arcade game development was created. In 1980, one of the first handheld video game systems, the Game & Watch, was created by Yokoi from the technology used in portable calculators.[3][40] It became one of Nintendo's most successful products, with over 43.4 million units sold worldwide during its production period, and for which 59 games were made in total.[53] The success of Game & Watch led Yamauchi to shift the company towards more electronic games in the years that followed.[52]
Nintendo entered the arcade video game market with Sheriff and Radar Scope, released in Japan in 1979 and 1980 respectively. Sheriff, also known as Bandido in some regions, marked the first original video game made by Nintendo, and was published by Sega and developed by Genyo Takeda and Shigeru Miyamoto.[51][54][55] Radar Scope rivaled Galaxian in Japanese arcades but failed to find an audience overseas and created a financial crisis for the company.[56] To try to find a more successful game, they put Miyamoto in charge of their next arcade game design, leading to the release of Donkey Kong in 1981, one of the first platform video games that allowed the player character to jump.[57] The character Jumpman would later become Mario and Nintendo's official mascot. Mario was named after Mario Segale, the landlord of Nintendo's offices in Tukwila, Washington.[58][59][60] Donkey Kong was a financial success for Nintendo both in Japan and overseas, and led Coleco to fight Atari for licensing rights for porting to home consoles and personal computers.[56]
In 1983, Nintendo opened a new production facility in Uji and was listed in the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.[3] Uemura, taking inspiration from the ColecoVision,[61] began creating a new video game console that would incorporate a ROM cartridge format for video games as well as both a central processing unit and a picture processing unit.[3][62][63] The Family Computer, or Famicom, was released in Japan in July 1983 along with three games adapted from their original arcade versions: Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Popeye.[64] Its success was such that in 1984, it surpassed the market share held by Sega's SG-1000.[65] That success also led to Nintendo leaving the Japanese arcade market in late 1985.[66][67] At this time, Nintendo adopted a series of guidelines that involved the validation of each game produced for the Famicom before its distribution on the market, agreements with developers to ensure that no Famicom game would be adapted to other consoles within two years of its release, and restricting developers from producing more than five games per year for the Famicom.[68]
In the early 1980s, several video game consoles proliferated in the United States, as well as low-quality games produced by third-party developers,[69] which oversaturated the market and led to the video game crash of 1983.[70] Consequently, a recession hit the American video game industry, whose revenues went from over $3 billion to $100 million between 1983 and 1985.[71] Nintendo's initiative to launch the Famicom in America was also impacted. To differentiate the Famicom from its competitors in America, Nintendo rebranded it as an entertainment system and its cartridges as Game Paks, with a design reminiscent of a VCR.[63] Nintendo implemented a lockout chip in the Game Paks for control on its third party library to avoid the market saturation that had occurred in the United States.[72] The result is the Nintendo Entertainment System, or NES, which was released in North America in 1985.[3] The landmark games Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda were produced by Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. Composer Koji Kondo reinforced the idea that musical themes could act as a complement to game mechanics rather than simply a miscellaneous element.[73] Production of the NES lasted until 1995,[74] and production of the Famicom lasted until 2003.[75] In total, around 62 million Famicom and NES consoles were sold worldwide.[76] During this period, Nintendo created a copyright infringement protection in the form of the Official Nintendo Seal of Quality, added to their products so that customers may recognize their authenticity in the market.[77] By this time, Nintendo's network of electronic suppliers had extended to around thirty companies, including Ricoh (Nintendo's main source for semiconductors) and the Sharp Corporation.[21]
In 1988, Yokoi and his team at Nintendo R&D1 conceived the Game Boy, the first handheld video game console made by Nintendo. Nintendo released the Game Boy in 1989. In North America, the Game Boy was bundled with the popular third-party game Tetris after a difficult negotiation process with Elektronorgtechnica.[78] The Game Boy was a significant success. In its first two weeks of sale in Japan, its initial inventory of 300,000 units sold out, and in the United States, an additional 40,000 units were sold on its first day of distribution.[79] Around this time, Nintendo entered an agreement with Sony to develop the Super Famicom CD-ROM Adapter, a peripheral for the upcoming Super Famicom capable of playing CD-ROMs.[80] However, the collaboration did not last as Yamauchi preferred to continue developing the technology with Philips, which would result in the CD-i,[81] and Sony's independent efforts resulted in the creation of the PlayStation console.[82]
The first issue of Nintendo Power magazine, which had an annual circulation of 1.5 million copies in the United States, was published in 1988.[83] In July 1989, Nintendo held the first Nintendo Space World trade show with the name Shoshinkai to announce and demonstrate upcoming Nintendo products.[84] That year, the first World of Nintendo stores-within-a-store, which carried official Nintendo merchandise, were opened in the United States. According to company information, more than 25% of homes in the United States had an NES in 1989.[83]
In the late 1980s, Nintendo's dominance slipped with the appearance of NEC's PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 and Sega's Mega Drive/Genesis, 16-bit game consoles with improved graphics and audio compared to the NES.[85] In response to the competition, Uemura designed the Super Famicom, which launched in 1990. The first batch of 300,000 consoles sold out in hours.[86] The following year, as with the NES, Nintendo distributed a modified version of the Super Famicom to the United States market, titled the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.[87] Launch games for the Super Famicom and Super NES include Super Mario World, F-Zero, Pilotwings, SimCity, and Gradius III.[88] By mid-1992, over 46 million Super Famicom and Super NES consoles had been sold.[3] The console's life cycle lasted until 1999 in the United States,[89] and until 2003 in Japan.[75]
In March 1990, the first Nintendo World Championship was held, with participants from 29 American cities competing for the title of ""best Nintendo player in the world"".[83][90] In June 1990, the subsidiary Nintendo of Europe was opened in Großostheim, Germany; in 1993, subsequent subsidiaries were established in the Netherlands (where Bandai had previously distributed Nintendo's products), France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Belgium, and Australia.[3] In 1992, Nintendo acquired a majority stake in the Seattle Mariners baseball team, and sold most of its shares in 2016.[91][92] On July 31, 1992, Nintendo of America announced it would cease manufacturing arcade games and systems.[93][94] In 1993, Star Fox was released, which marked an industry milestone by being the first video game to make use of the Super FX chip.[3]
The proliferation of graphically violent video games, such as Mortal Kombat, caused controversy and led to the creation of the Interactive Digital Software Association and the Entertainment Software Rating Board, in whose development Nintendo collaborated during 1994. These measures also encouraged Nintendo to abandon the content guidelines it had enforced since the release of the NES.[95][96] Commercial strategies implemented by Nintendo during this time include the Nintendo Gateway System, an in-flight entertainment service available for airlines, cruise ships and hotels,[97] and the ""Play It Loud!"" advertising campaign for Game Boys with different-colored casings. The Advanced Computer Modeling graphics used in Donkey Kong Country for the Super NES and Donkey Kong Land for the Game Boy were technologically innovative, as was the Satellaview satellite modem peripheral for the Super Famicom, which allowed the digital transmission of data via a communications satellite in space.[3]
In 1995, Nintendo released the Virtual Boy, a console designed by Yokoi with stereoscopic graphics. Critics were generally disappointed with the quality of the games and red-colored graphics, and complained of gameplay-induced headaches.[98] The system sold poorly and was quietly discontinued.[99] Amid the system's failure, Yokoi formally retired from Nintendo.[100]
In February 1996, Pocket Monsters Red and Green (known internationally as Pokémon Red and Blue) was developed by Game Freak and released in Japan for the Game Boy, establishing the popular Pokémon franchise.[101]: 191  The game went on to sell 31.37 million units,[102] with the video game series exceeding a total of 300 million units in sales as of 2017.[103]
The Nintendo 64 was released in June 1996 in Japan, September 1996 in the United States and March 1997 in Europe. Though planned for release in 1995, the production schedules of third-party developers influenced a delay,[104][105] The console was in development since mid-1993, when Nintendo and Silicon Graphics announced a strategic alliance to develop the console.[106][107] NEC, Toshiba, and Sharp also contributed technology to the console.[108] The Nintendo 64 was marketed as one of the first consoles to be designed with 64-bit architecture.[109] In 1997, Nintendo released the Rumble Pak, a plug-in device that connects to the Nintendo 64 controller and produces a vibration during certain moments of a game.[3] By the end of its production in 2002, around 33 million Nintendo 64 consoles were sold worldwide,[76] and it is considered one of the most recognized video game systems in history.[110] 388 games were produced for the Nintendo 64 in total,[111] some of which – particularly Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and GoldenEye 007 – have been distinguished as some of the greatest of all time.[112]
In 1998, the Game Boy Color was released. In addition to backward compatibility with Game Boy games, the console's similar capacity to the NES resulted in select adaptations of games from that library, such as Super Mario Bros. Deluxe.[113] Since then, over 118.6 million Game Boy and Game Boy Color consoles have been sold worldwide.[114]
A series of administrative changes occurred in 2000 when Nintendo's corporate offices were moved to the Minami-ku neighborhood in Kyoto, and Nintendo Benelux was established to manage the Dutch and Belgian territories.[3]
In 2001, two new Nintendo consoles were introduced: the Game Boy Advance, which was designed by Gwénaël Nicolas with stylistic departure from its predecessors,[115][116] and the GameCube,[117] which features a 128-bit Gekko processor from IBM and a DVD drive from Panasonic.[118] During the first week of the Game Boy Advance's North American release in June 2001, over 500,000 units were sold, making it the fastest-selling video game console in the United States at the time.[119] By the end of its production cycle in 2010, more than 81.5 million units had been sold worldwide.[114] As for the GameCube, even with such distinguishing features as the miniDVD format of its games and Internet connectivity for a few games,[120][121] its sales were lower than those of its predecessors, and during the six years of its production, 21.7 million units were sold worldwide.[122] The GameCube struggled against its rivals in the market,[123][124] and its initial poor sales led to Nintendo posting a first half fiscal year loss in 2003 for the first time since the company went public in 1962.[125]
In 2002, the Pokémon Mini was released. Its dimensions were smaller than that of the Game Boy Advance and it weighed 70 grams, making it the smallest video game console in history.[3] Nintendo collaborated with Sega and Namco to develop Triforce, an arcade board to facilitate the conversion of arcade titles to the GameCube.[126] Following the European release of the GameCube in May 2002,[127] Hiroshi Yamauchi announced his resignation as the president of Nintendo, and Satoru Iwata was selected by the company as his successor. Yamauchi would remain as advisor and director of the company until 2005.[128] Iwata's appointment as president ended the Yamauchi succession at the helm of the company, a practice that had been in place since its foundation.[129][130]
In 2003, Nintendo released the Game Boy Advance SP, an improved version of the Game Boy Advance with a foldable case, an illuminated display, and a rechargeable battery. By the end of its production cycle in 2010, over 43.5 million units had been sold worldwide.[114] Nintendo also released the Game Boy Player, a peripheral that allows Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games to be played on the GameCube.
In 2004, Nintendo released the Nintendo DS, which featured such innovations as dual screens – one of which is a touchscreen – and wireless connectivity for multiplayer play.[3][131] Throughout its lifetime, more than 154 million units were sold, making it the most successful handheld console and the second bestselling console in history.[114] In 2005, Nintendo released the Game Boy Micro, the last system in the Game Boy line.[3][113] Sales did not meet Nintendo's expectations,[132] with 2.5 million units being sold by 2007.[133] In mid-2005, the Nintendo World Store was inaugurated in New York City.[134]
Nintendo's next home console was conceived in 2001, although development commenced in 2003, taking inspiration from the Nintendo DS.[135] Nintendo also considered the relative failure of the GameCube and instead opted to take a ""Blue Ocean Strategy"" by developing a reduced performance console in contrast to the high-performance consoles of Sony and Microsoft to avoid directly competing with them.[136] The Wii was released in November 2006,[137] with a total of 33 launch games.[138] With the Wii, Nintendo sought to reach a broader demographic than its seventh-generation competitors,[139] with the intention of also encompassing the ""non-consumer"" sector.[140] Nintendo invested in a $200 million advertising campaign to that end.[141] The Wii's innovations include the Wii Remote controller, equipped with an accelerometer system and infrared sensors that allow it to detect its position in a three-dimensional environment with the aid of a sensor bar;[142][143] the Nunchuk peripheral that includes an analog controller and an accelerometer;[144] and the Wii MotionPlus expansion that increases the sensitivity of the main controller with the aid of gyroscopes.[145] By 2016, more than 101 million Wii consoles had been sold worldwide,[146] making it the most successful console of its generation, a distinction that Nintendo had not achieved since the 1990s with the Super NES.[147]
Several accessories were released for the Wii from 2007 to 2010, such as the Wii Balance Board, the Wii Wheel and the WiiWare download service. In 2009, Nintendo Iberica S.A. expanded its commercial operations to Portugal through a new office in Lisbon.[3] By that year, Nintendo held a 68.3% share of the worldwide handheld gaming market.[148]
After an announcement in March 2010,[149] Nintendo released the Nintendo 3DS in 2011. The console produces stereoscopic effects without 3D glasses.[150] By 2018, more than 69 million units had been sold worldwide;[151] the figure increased to 75 million by the start of 2019.[146]
In 2012 and 2013, two new Nintendo game consoles were introduced: the Wii U, with high-definition graphics and a GamePad controller with near-field communication technology,[152][153] and the Nintendo 2DS, a version of the 3DS that lacks the clamshell design of Nintendo's previous handheld consoles and the stereoscopic effects of the 3DS.[154] With 13.5 million units sold worldwide,[146] the Wii U is the least successful video game console in Nintendo's history.[155] In 2014, a new product line was released consisting of figures of Nintendo characters called Amiibos.[3]
On 25 September 2013, Nintendo announced its acquisition of a 28% stake in PUX Corporation, a subsidiary of Panasonic, to develop facial, voice, and text recognition for its video games.[156] Due to a 30% decrease in company income between April and December 2013, Iwata announced a temporary 50% cut to his salary, with other executives seeing reductions by 20%–30%.[157] In January 2015, Nintendo ceased operations in the Brazilian market due in part to high import duties. This did not affect the rest of Nintendo's Latin American market due to an alliance with Juegos de Video Latinoamérica.[158] Nintendo reached an agreement with NC Games for Nintendo's products to resume distribution in Brazil by 2017,[159] and by September 2020, the Switch was released in Brazil.[160]
On 11 July 2015, Iwata died of bile duct cancer, and after a couple of months in which Miyamoto and Takeda jointly operated the company, Tatsumi Kimishima was named as Iwata's successor on 16 September 2015.[161] As part of the management's restructuring, Miyamoto and Takeda were named creative and technological advisors, respectively.[162] The financial losses caused by the Wii U, along with Sony's intention to release its video games to other platforms such as smart TVs, motivated Nintendo to rethink its strategy concerning the production and distribution of its properties.[163] In 2015, Nintendo formalized agreements with DeNA and Universal Parks & Resorts to extend its presence to smart devices and amusement parks respectively.[164][165][166]
In March 2016, Nintendo's first mobile app for the iOS and Android systems, Miitomo, was released.[167] Since then, Nintendo has produced other similar apps, such as Super Mario Run, Fire Emblem Heroes, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, Mario Kart Tour, and Pokémon Go, the last being developed by Niantic and having generated $115 million in revenue for Nintendo.[168] In March 2016, the loyalty program My Nintendo replaced Club Nintendo.[169] The NES Classic Edition was released in November 2016. The console is a version of the NES based on emulation, HDMI, and the Wii remote.[170] Its successor, the Super NES Classic Edition, was released in September 2017.[171] By October 2018, around ten million units of both consoles combined had been sold worldwide.[172]
The Wii U's successor in the eighth generation of video game consoles, the Nintendo Switch, was released in March 2017. The Switch features a hybrid design as a home and handheld console, Joy-Con controllers that each contain an accelerometer and gyroscope, and the simultaneous wireless networking of up to eight consoles.[173] To expand its library, Nintendo entered alliances with several third-party and independent developers;[174][175] by February 2019, more than 1,800 Switch games had been released.[176] The Switch has shipped over 150 million units worldwide as of December 2024[update], becoming the third-best selling console of all time behind the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS. It is also Nintendo's most successful home console to date, surpassing the Wii's 101.6 million units.
In 2018, Shuntaro Furukawa replaced Kimishima as company president,[177] and in 2019, Doug Bowser succeeded Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé.[178] In April 2019, Nintendo formed an alliance with Tencent to distribute the Nintendo Switch in China starting in December.[179]
In April 2020, Reuters reported that ValueAct Capital had acquired over 2.6 million shares in Nintendo stock worth US$1.1 billion over the course of a year, giving them an overall stake of 2% in Nintendo.[180] Although the COVID-19 pandemic caused delays in the production and distribution of some of Nintendo's products, the situation ""had limited impact on business results""; in May 2020, Nintendo reported a 75% increase in income compared to the previous fiscal year, mainly contributed by the Nintendo Switch Online service.[181] The year saw some changes to the company's management: outside director Naoki Mizutani retired from the board, and was replaced by Asa Shinkawa; and Yoshiaki Koizumi was promoted to senior executive officer, maintaining his role as deputy general manager of Nintendo EPD.[181] By August, Nintendo was named the richest company in Japan.[182]
Super Nintendo World, a theme park area, opened at Universal Studios Japan in 2021.[183][184] Nintendo co-produced an animated film The Super Mario Bros. Movie alongside Universal Pictures and Illumination, with Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri acting as producers.[185][186] In 2021, Furukawa indicated Nintendo's plan to create more animated projects based on their work outside the Mario film,[187] and by 29 June, Meledandri joined the board of directors as a non-executive outside director.[188][189] According to Furukawa, the company's expansion toward animated production is to keep ""[the] business [of producing video games] thriving and growing"", realizing the ""need to create opportunities where even people who do not normally play on video game systems can come into contact with Nintendo characters"". That day, Miyamoto said that ""[Meledandri] really came to understand the Nintendo point of view"" and that ""asking for [his] input, as an expert with many years of experience in Hollywood, will be of great help to"" Nintendo's transition into film production.[190] Later, in July 2022, Nintendo acquired Dynamo Pictures, a Japanese CG company founded by Hiroshi Hirokawa on 18 March 2011. Dynamo had worked with Nintendo on digital shorts in the 2010s, including for the Pikmin series, and Nintendo said that Dynamo would continue their goal of expanding into animation. Following the completion of the acquisition in October 2022, Nintendo renamed Dynamo as Nintendo Pictures.[191][192]
In February 2022, Nintendo announced the acquisition of SRD Co., Ltd. (Systems Research and Development) after 40 years, a major contributor of Nintendo's first-party games such as Donkey Kong and The Legend of Zelda until the 1990s, and then support studio since.[193] In May 2022, Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund had purchased a 5% stake in Nintendo,[194] and by January 2023, its stake in the company had increased to 6.07%.[195] It was raised to 7.08% by February 2023, and in the same week by 8.26%, making it the biggest external investor.[196][197] In November 2024, Saudi Arabia's PIF dropped back to 6.3%.[198]
In early 2023, the Super Nintendo World theme park area in Universal Studios Hollywood opened.[199] The Super Mario Bros. Movie was released on 5 April 2023, and has grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide, setting box-office records for the biggest worldwide opening weekend for an animated film, the highest-grossing film based on a video game and the 15th-highest-grossing film of all-time.[200]
Nintendo reached an agreement with Embracer Group in May 2024 to acquire 100% of the shares in Shiver Entertainment, a company that has specialized in porting triple-A games like Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1 to the Switch, making it a wholly owned subsidiary of Nintendo, subject to closing conditions.[201][202] In October 2024, the company opened the Nintendo Museum on the site of its former Uji Ogura plant, where it had manufactured playing and hanafuda cards.[203] The same month, Nintendo announced Nintendo Music, a mobile application enabling one to listen to soundtracks from Nintendo games.[204] By November 2024, Nintendo gained full ownership of Monolith Soft, a first-party developer behind Xenoblade Chronicles and provided support for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.[205]
The successor to the Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2, was released on June 5, 2025. It has a larger display and more internal storage than the original Switch. It has updated graphics, controllers, and social features. It supports 1080p resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate in handheld or tabletop mode, and 4K resolution with a 60Hz refresh rate when docked.[206] On June 10, Nintendo reported that the Switch 2 had sold more than 3.5 million units worldwide, becoming the fastest selling console in history, overtaking the previous record-holder, the PlayStation 2.[207][208] In September 2025, Nintendo announced that the sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie, titled The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, is scheduled to be released on April 3, 2026.[209]
Nintendo's central focus is the research, development, production, and distribution of entertainment products—primarily video game software and hardware and card games. Its main markets are Japan, America, and Europe, and more than 70% of its total sales come from the latter two territories.[210] As of May 2025, Nintendo's game consoles have sold over 860 million units, for which more than 5.9 billion video games have been sold globally.[211]
Since the launch of the Color TV-Game in 1977, Nintendo has produced and distributed home, handheld, dedicated, and hybrid consoles. In the 1980s, its first consoles to be successful were the Game & Watch and Nintendo Entertainment System. In the 1990s Nintendo launched new generations of home consoles with the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Nintendo 64 and achieved global success with the Game Boy handheld console. In the 2000s, Nintendo found wide success again, with both the Nintendo DS and Wii. Each has a variety of accessories and controllers, such as the NES Zapper, the Game Boy Camera, the Super NES Mouse, the Rumble Pak, the Wii MotionPlus, the Wii U Pro Controller, and the Switch Pro Controller.
Nintendo's first electronic games are arcade games. EVR Race (1975) was the company's first electromechanical game, and Donkey Kong (1981) was the first platform game in history. Since then, both Nintendo and other development companies have produced and distributed an extensive catalog of video games for Nintendo's consoles. Nintendo's games are sold in both removable media formats such as optical disc and cartridge, and online formats which are distributed via services such as the Nintendo eShop and the Nintendo Network.
Nintendo's internal research and development operations are divided into three main divisions:
The Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development division is the primary software development, production, and supervising division at Nintendo, formed as a merger between their former Entertainment Analysis & Development and Software Planning & Development divisions in 2015. Led by Shinya Takahashi, the division holds the largest concentration of staff at the company, housing more than 800 engineers, producers, directors, coordinators, planners, and designers.
The Nintendo Platform Technology Development division is a combination of Nintendo's former Integrated Research & Development (IRD) and System Development (SDD) divisions. Led by Ko Shiota, the division is responsible for designing hardware and developing Nintendo's operating systems, developer environment, and internal network, and maintenance of the Nintendo Network.
The Nintendo Business Development division was formed following Nintendo's foray into software development for smart devices such as mobile phones and tablets. It is responsible for refining Nintendo's business model for the dedicated video game system business and overseeing development for smart devices.
Notable board members include Shigeru Miyamoto, Satoru Shibata and Outside Director Chris Meledandri, CEO of Illumination Entertainment; notable executive officers include Yoshiaki Koizumi, Deputy general manager of Entertainment Planning & Development division, Takashi Tezuka and Senior officer of Entertainment Planning & Development division.
Headquartered in Kyoto, Japan since the beginning, Nintendo Co., Ltd. oversees the organization's global operations and manages Japanese operations specifically. The company's two major subsidiaries, Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe, manage operations in North America and Europe respectively. Nintendo Co., Ltd.[215] later moved from its original Kyoto location to a new office in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto; this became the research and development building in 2000 when the head office relocated to its present[update] location in Minami-ku, Kyoto.[216]
Nintendo founded its North American subsidiary in 1980 as Nintendo of America (NoA). Hiroshi Yamauchi appointed his son-in-law Minoru Arakawa as president, who in turn hired his own wife and Yamauchi's daughter Yoko Yamauchi as the first employee. The Arakawa family moved from Vancouver, British Columbia to select an office in Manhattan, New York due to its central status in American commerce. As both were from extremely affluent families, their goals were set more by prestige than money. The seed capital and product inventory were supplied by the parent corporation in Japan, with a launch goal of entering the existing $8 billion-per-year coin-op arcade video game market and the largest entertainment industry in the US, which had already outclassed movies and television combined. During the couple's arcade research excursions, NoA hired young gamers to work in the poorly maintained warehouse in New Jersey to receive and service game hardware from Japan.[217]
In late 1980, NoA contracted the Seattle-based arcade sales and distribution company Far East Video, consisting solely of experienced arcade salespeople Ron Judy and Al Stone. The two had already built a decent reputation and a distribution network, founded specifically for the independent import and sales of games from Nintendo because the Japanese company had for years been the under-represented maverick in America. Now as direct associates to the new NoA, they told Arakawa they could always clear all Nintendo inventory if Nintendo produced better games. Far East Video took NoA's contract for a fixed per-unit commission on the exclusive American distributorship of Nintendo games, to be settled by their Seattle-based lawyer, Howard Lincoln.[217]
Based on favorable test arcade sites in Seattle, Arakawa wagered most of NoA's modest finances on a huge order of 3,000 Radar Scope cabinets. He panicked when the game failed in the fickle market upon its arrival from its four-month boat ride from Japan. Far East Video was already in financial trouble due to declining sales and Ron Judy borrowed his aunt's life savings of $50,000, while still hoping Nintendo would develop its first Pac-Man-sized hit. Arakawa regretted founding the Nintendo subsidiary, with the distressed Yoko trapped between her arguing husband and father.[218]
Amid financial threat, Nintendo of America relocated from Manhattan to the Seattle metro to remove major stressors: the frenetic New York and New Jersey lifestyle and commute, and the extra weeks or months on the shipping route from Japan as was suffered by the Radar Scope disaster. With the Seattle harbor being the US's closest to Japan at only nine days by boat, and having a lumber production market for arcade cabinets, Arakawa's real estate scouts found a 60,000-square-foot (5,600 m2) warehouse for rent containing three offices—one for Arakawa and one for Judy and Stone.[219] This warehouse in the Tukwila suburb was owned by Mario Segale, after whom the Mario character would be named,[58][59] and was initially managed by former Far East Video employee Don James.[220] After one month, James recruited his college friend Howard Phillips as an assistant, who soon took over as warehouse manager.[221][222][223][224][225][226] The company remained at fewer than 10 employees for some time, handling sales, marketing, advertising, distribution, and limited manufacturing[227]: 160  of arcade cabinets and Game & Watch handheld units, all sourced and shipped from Nintendo.
Arakawa was still panicked over NoA's ongoing financial crisis. With the parent company having no new game ideas, he had been repeatedly pleading for Yamauchi to reassign some top talent away from existing Japanese products to develop something for America—especially to redeem the massive dead stock of Radar Scope cabinets. Since all of Nintendo's key engineers and programmers were busy, and with NoA representing only a tiny fraction of the parent's overall business, Yamauchi allowed only the assignment of Gunpei Yokoi's young assistant who had no background in engineering, Shigeru Miyamoto.[228]
NoA's staff—except the sole young gamer Howard Phillips—were uniformly revolted at the sight of the freshman developer Miyamoto's debut game, which they had imported in the form of emergency conversion kits for the overstock of Radar Scope cabinets.[220] The kits transformed the cabinets into NoA's massive windfall gain of $280 million from Miyamoto's smash hit Donkey Kong in 1981–1983 alone.[229][230] They sold 4,000 new arcade units each month in America, making the 24-year-old Phillips ""the largest volume shipping manager for the entire Port of Seattle"".[225] Arakawa used these profits to buy 27 acres (11 ha) of land in Redmond in July 1982[231] and to perform the $50 million launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985 which revitalized the entire video game industry from its devastating 1983 crash.[232][233] A second warehouse in Redmond was soon secured, and managed by Don James. The company stayed at around 20 employees for some years.
On August 10, 1993, Nintendo of America rolled out the Nintendo Gateway System.[234]
The organization was reshaped nationwide in the following decades, and those core sales and marketing business functions are now directed by the office in Redwood City, California. The company's distribution centers are Nintendo Atlanta in Atlanta, Georgia, and Nintendo North Bend in North Bend, Washington. As of 2007[update], the 380,000-square-foot (35,000 m2) Nintendo North Bend facility processes more than 20,000 orders a day to Nintendo customers, which include retail stores that sell Nintendo products in addition to consumers who shop Nintendo's website.[235] Nintendo of America's Canadian branch, Nintendo of Canada, is based in Vancouver, British Columbia with a distribution center in Toronto.[236] Nintendo Treehouse is NoA's localization team, composed of around 80 staff who are responsible for translating text from Japanese to English, creating videos and marketing plans, and quality assurance.[237]
Nintendo of America announced in October 2021 that it will be closing its offices in Redwood City, California, and Toronto and merging its operations with its Redmond and Vancouver offices.[238] In April 2022, an anonymous quality assurance worker filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging Nintendo of America and contractor Aston Carter had engaged in union-busting activities and surveillance. The employee had been fired for mentioning unionizing efforts in the industry during a company meeting.[239][240] The companies agreed to a settlement with the employee in October 2022.[241] In March 2024, Nintendo of America restructured its product testing teams, resulting in the elimination of over 100 contractor roles. Some of the affected contractors were given full-time roles.[242]
Nintendo's European subsidiary was established in June 1990,[243] based in Frankfurt, Germany.[244] The company handles operations across Europe (excluding Scandinavia, where operations are handled by Bergsala on behalf of NOE),[245] as well as South Africa.[243] Nintendo of Europe's United Kingdom branch (Nintendo UK)[246] handles operations in that country and in Ireland from its headquarters in Windsor, Berkshire. In June 2014, NOE initiated a reduction and consolidation process, yielding a combined 130 layoffs: the closing of its office and warehouse, termination of all employment, in Großostheim; and the consolidation of all of those operations into, and terminating some employment at, its Frankfurt location.[247][248] As of July 2018, the company employs 850 people.[249] In October 2018, Nintendo of Europe announced plans to relocate to a new 160,000-square-foot (15,000 m2) headquarters in Frankfurt,[250] eventually moving into the location in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.[251] In 2019, NOE signed with Tor Gaming Ltd. for official distribution in Israel.[252]
Nintendo's Australian subsidiary is based in Melbourne. It handles the publishing, distribution, sales, and marketing of Nintendo products in Australia and New Zealand. It also manufactured some Wii games locally.[citation needed]
Nintendo's South Korean subsidiary was established on 7 July 2006 and is based in Seoul.[253] In March 2016, the subsidiary was heavily downsized due to a corporate restructuring after analyzing shifts in the current market, laying off 80% of its employees, leaving only ten people, including former CEO Hiroyuki Fukuda. This did not affect any games scheduled for release in South Korea, and Nintendo continued operations there as usual.[254][255] Takahiro Miura would later take over as CEO in 2018. In April 2025, the subsidiary gained international attention when its website unintentionally leaked the presence of young Pauline in Donkey Kong Bananza.[256][257]
Nintendo's Singaporean subsidiary was established on 26 September 2025.[258] Takahiro Miura is the supervising branch manager.[258]
Nintendo Phuten was incorporated in Taipei, Taiwan in 1991 as Phuten Co., Ltd. As Nintendo's Taiwanese subsidiary, it distributed Nintendo's products in Taiwan until its closure in 2014.[259] Its responsibilities was handed over to Nintendo (Hong Kong) Limited until 2025 when Nintendo Taiwan Co., Ltd. was formed in Taipei to handle sales in the region.[260][261]
Nintendo (Hong Kong) Limited was incorporated on 7 April 2005. It marketed the Wii in Hong Kong, after Nintendo could not market the console in Mainland China under iQue for being unable to circumvent the ban on foreign-made consoles imposed by the Chinese government.[262][263] It currently handles distribution of Nintendo consoles in Hong Kong and Macau. Taiwan was also included under the division from 2014 until 2025.
Although most of the research and development (R&D) is being done in Japan, there are some R&D facilities in the United States, Europe, and China that are focused on developing software and hardware technologies used in Nintendo products. Although they all are subsidiaries of Nintendo (and therefore first-party), they are often referred to as external resources when being involved in joint development processes with Nintendo's internal developers by the Japanese personnel involved. This can be seen in the Iwata Asks interview series.[264] Nintendo Software Technology (NST) and Nintendo Technology Development (NTD) are located in Redmond, Washington, United States, while Nintendo European Research & Development (NERD) is located in Paris, France, and Nintendo Network Service Database (NSD) is located in Kyoto, Japan.
Most external first-party software development is done in Japan, because the only overseas subsidiaries are Retro Studios and Shiver Entertainment in the United States (acquired in 2002[265] and 2024,[266] respectively) and Next Level Games in Canada (acquired in 2021).[267] Although these studios are all subsidiaries of Nintendo, they are often referred to as external resources when being involved in joint development processes with Nintendo's internal developers by the Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development (EPD) division. 1-Up Studio and Nintendo Cube are located in Tokyo, Japan, and Monolith Soft has one studio located in Tokyo and another in Kyoto.
Nintendo established The Pokémon Company alongside Creatures and Game Freak to manage the Pokémon brand. Similarly, Warpstar, Inc. was formed through a joint investment with HAL Laboratory, which was in charge of the Kirby: Right Back at Ya! animated series as well as the web series It's Kirby Time. Both companies are investments from Nintendo, with Nintendo holding 32% of the shares of The Pokémon Company and 50% of the shares of Warpstar, Inc. Following the success of the Super Mario Bros. movie, Nintendo bought out HAL Laboratory's stake in Warpstar in April 2025, and by August 2025, rebranded the subsidiary as Nintendo Stars to focus on further multimedia initiatives involving Nintendo's IP.[268]
Other notable subsidiaries include:
Active Boeki is a distribution company based in Kobe that handles the distribution of Nintendo hardware and software in Southeast Asia and the Middle East since the Game & Watch era, under the responsibility of Nintendo Co. Ltd. in Japan.[269] The company works with local resellers, such as Singapore-based Maxsoft handling distribution and sales in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. Active Boeki also works with resellers such as UAE-based Active Gulf and Saudi-based Shas Samurai, responsible for distribution and sales in the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.[270] In 2023, Active Boeki through Shas Samurai has ceased its distributing operations for Saudi Arabia, as AIC Trading received distribution rights for Nintendo in the country, overseen by Nintendo of Europe.[269] Active Boeki through Maxsoft is also no longer the sole exclusive distributor for Nintendo in Southeast Asia after the appointment of new distributors in charge of distribution, sales, promotion and pop-up stores related to Nintendo products domestically in all countries previously covered by Maxsoft except Indonesia, such as Convergent Systems responsible for Singapore and Malaysia,[271][272] Synnex for Thailand,[273] and VST-ECS for the Philippines.[274]
Bergsala, a third-party company based in Sweden, exclusively handles Nintendo operations in the Nordic region. Bergsala's relationship with Nintendo was established in 1981 when the company sought to distribute Game & Watch units to Sweden, which later expanded to the NES console by 1986. Bergsala was the only non-Nintendo owned distributor of Nintendo's products until 2019,[275] when Tor Gaming gained distribution rights in Israel.
Nintendo has partnered with Tencent to release Nintendo products in China, following the lifting of the country's console ban in 2015. In addition to distributing hardware, Tencent helps with the governmental approval process for video game software.[276]
In January 2019, Ynet and IGN Israel reported that negotiations about the official distribution of Nintendo products in the country were ongoing.[252] After two months, IGN Israel announced that Tor Gaming Ltd., a company established in earlier 2019, gained a distribution agreement with Nintendo of Europe, handling official retailing beginning at the start of March,[277] followed by opening an official online store the next month.[278]
Nintendo of America has engaged in several high-profile marketing campaigns to define and position its brand. One of its earliest and most enduring slogans was ""Now you're playing with power!"", used first to promote its Nintendo Entertainment System.[279] It modified the slogan to include ""SUPER power"" for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and ""PORTABLE power"" for the Game Boy.[280]
Its 1994 ""Play It Loud!"" campaign played upon teenage rebellion and fostered an edgy reputation.[281] During the Nintendo 64 era, the slogan was ""Get N or get out"".[280] During the GameCube era, the ""Who Are You?"" suggested a link between the games and the players' identities.[282] The company promoted its Nintendo DS handheld with the tagline ""Touching is Good"".[283] For the Wii, they used the ""Wii would like to play"" slogan to promote the console with the people who tried the games including Super Mario Galaxy and Super Paper Mario.[284] The Nintendo 3DS used the slogan ""Take a look inside"".[285] The Wii U used the slogan ""How U will play next"".[286] The Nintendo Switch uses the slogan ""Switch and Play"" in North America, and ""Play anywhere, anytime, with anyone"" elsewhere.[287]
During the peak of Nintendo's success in the video game industry in the 1990s, its name was ubiquitously used to refer to any video game console, regardless of the manufacturer. To prevent its trademark from becoming generic, Nintendo pushed the term ""game console"", and succeeded in preserving its trademark.[288][289]
Nintendo operates or licenses retail stores across the world.
In Hong Kong, a third-party franchisee operates several Nintendo Switch-focused retail stores under the name of NSEW. The first store opened in March 2020 in Sham Shui Po.[290][291] Two additional stores later opened,[292] alongside a temporary pop-up store in the Hong Kong International Airport.[293]
Another Nintendo Switch-focused store, Assemble, is located in Wan Chai. This store opened on November 14, 2024. This store features a dedicated section to third-party developer and publisher Cygames.[294]
On February 1, 2019, Nintendo announced that it would open Nintendo Tokyo as a facility at the then-under-construction Shibuya Parco department store in the Fall of that year, being their first self-managed store in the country.[295] The store opened with the complex on November 22, 2019.[296]
Since Nintendo Tokyo's opening, two additional Nintendo stores have opened in Japan. Nintendo Osaka opened on November 11, 2022, located on the thirteenth floor of the Daimaru Umeda department store in Kita-ku, as a store-within-a-store.[297] Nintendo Kyoto, located within the Takashimaya Department Store building in Kyoto, opened on October 17, 2023.[298]
In May 2012, Shas Samurai, Nintendo's official representative in Saudi Arabia, opened a ""Nintendo World Store"" at Al Faisaliah Mall in Riyadh.[299][300]
Nintendo opened its first retail store, Nintendo World (now Nintendo New York), on May 14, 2005, at the former location of the Pokémon Center at Rockefeller Center in New York City.[301]
Nintendo opened its second US store called Nintendo San Francisco in the city's Union Square neighborhood on May 15, 2025.[302][303]
The Nintendo of America headquarters in Redmond, Washington has a private store which is open only to employees and invited guests.[304]
Additionally, Nintendo launched official pop-up stores in 2021 at various Japanese cities,[305] and later in 2023 in Seoul,[306][307] Singapore,[308] and Hong Kong.[309][310]
In use since the 1960s, Nintendo's most recognizable logo is the ovoid racetrack shape, especially the red-colored wordmark typically displayed on a white background, primarily used in the Western markets from 1985 to 2006. In Japan, a monochromatic version that lacks a colored background is on Nintendo's own Famicom, Super Famicom, Nintendo 64, GameCube, and handheld console packaging and marketing. Since 2006, in conjunction with the launch of the Wii, Nintendo changed its logo to a gray variant that lacks a colored background inside the wordmark, making it transparent. Nintendo's official, corporate logo remains this variation.[311][failed verification] For consumer products and marketing, a white variant on a red background has been used since 2016, and has been in full effect since the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017.
Unlike most Japanese companies, Nintendo has generally kept a large cash reserve instead of using the extra funds for investments or stock buybacks and dividends, a policy set in place by Hiroshi Yamauchi. As of September 2025, the company is estimated to have ¥1.5 trillion in cash reserves, amounting to around 120% of its sales. This cash reserved helped Nintendo quickly recover from poor sales of the GameCube and Wii U, as well as provide financial assurance for Nintendo to put into long-term projects.[52]
For many years, Nintendo had a policy of strict content guidelines for video games published on its consoles. Although Nintendo allowed graphic violence in its video games released in Japan, nudity and sexuality were strictly prohibited. Former Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi believed that if the company allowed the licensing of pornographic games, the company's image would be forever tarnished.[312] Nintendo of America went further and games released for Nintendo consoles could not feature nudity, sexuality, profanity (including racism, sexism or slurs), blood, graphic or domestic violence, drugs, political messages, or religious symbols—with the exception of widely unpracticed religions, such as the Greek Pantheon.[313] The Japanese parent company was concerned that it may be viewed as a ""Japanese invasion"" by forcing Japanese community standards on North American and European children. Past the strict guidelines, some exceptions have occurred: Bionic Commando (though swastikas were eliminated in the US version), Smash TV and Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode contain human violence, the latter also containing implied sexuality and tobacco use, River City Ransom and Taboo: The Sixth Sense contain nudity, and the latter also contains religious images, as do Castlevania II and III.
Nintendo's content policy is responsible for the Genesis version of Mortal Kombat having more than double the unit sales of the Super NES version, largely due to Nintendo forcing its publisher Acclaim to recolor red blood to look like white sweat within the game and to tone down its gorier and more violent graphics.[314] By contrast, Sega allowed blood and gore to remain in the Genesis version (though a code is required to unlock the gore). Nintendo allowed the Super NES version of Mortal Kombat II to ship uncensored the following year with a content warning on the packaging.[315]
Video game ratings systems were introduced with the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) of 1994 and the Pan European Game Information of 2003, and Nintendo discontinued most of its censorship policies in favor of consumers making their own choices. Today changes to the content of games are done primarily by the game's developer or, occasionally, at the request of Nintendo. The only clear-set rule is that ESRB AO-rated games will not be licensed on Nintendo consoles in North America,[316] a practice which is also enforced by Sony and Microsoft, its greatest competitors in the present market. Nintendo has since allowed several mature-content games to be published on its consoles, including Perfect Dark, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Doom, Doom 64, BMX XXX, the Resident Evil series, Killer7, the Mortal Kombat series, Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, BloodRayne, Geist, Dementium: The Ward, Bayonetta 2, Devil's Third, and Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water.
Certain games have continued to be modified, however. For example, Konami was forced to remove all references to cigarettes in the 2000 Game Boy Color game Metal Gear Solid (although the previous NES version of Metal Gear, the GameCube game Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, and the 3DS game Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater 3D, included such references), and maiming and blood were removed from the Nintendo 64 port of Cruis'n USA.[317] Another example is in the Game Boy Advance game Mega Man Zero 3, in which one of the bosses, called Hellbat Schilt in the Japanese and European releases, was renamed Devilbat Schilt in the North American localization. In North American releases of the Mega Man Zero games, enemies and bosses killed with a saber attack do not gush blood as they do in the Japanese versions. However, the release of the Wii was accompanied by several even more controversial games, such as Manhunt 2, No More Heroes, The House of the Dead: Overkill, and MadWorld, the latter three of which were initially published exclusively for the console.
Nintendo of America also had guidelines before 1993 that had to be followed by its licensees to make games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, in addition to the above content guidelines.[312] Guidelines were enforced through the 10NES lockout chip.
The last rule was circumvented in several ways; for example, Konami, wanting to produce more games for Nintendo's consoles, formed Ultra Games and later Palcom to produce more games as a technically different publisher.[312] This disadvantaged smaller or emerging companies, as they could not afford to start more companies. In another side effect, Square Co. (now Square Enix) executives have suggested that the price of publishing games on the Nintendo 64[319] along with the degree of censorship and control which Nintendo enforced over its games,[citation needed] most notably Final Fantasy VI, were factors in switching its focus towards Sony's PlayStation console.
In 1993, a class action suit was taken against Nintendo under allegations that their lockout chip enabled unfair business practices. The case was settled, with the condition that California consumers were entitled to a $3 discount coupon for a game of Nintendo's choice.[320]
Nintendo has generally been proactive in ensuring that its intellectual property in both hardware and software is protected. Nintendo's protection of its properties began as early as the arcade release of Donkey Kong which was widely cloned on other platforms, a practice common to the most popular arcade games of the era. Nintendo did seek legal action to try to stop the release of these unauthorized clones but estimated they still lost $100 million in potential sales to these clones.[321] Since then, Nintendo has been proactive in preventing copyright infringement of its games by video game emulators and fan games and other works using the company's intellectual property. The company has also suffered from various data breaches and has sought action against those that have released these leaks.
The gold sunburst seal was first used by Nintendo of America, and later by Nintendo of Europe. It is displayed on any game, system, or accessory licensed for use on one of its video game consoles, denoting the game has been properly approved by Nintendo. The seal is also displayed on any Nintendo-licensed merchandise, such as trading cards, game guides, or apparel, albeit with the words ""Official Nintendo Licensed Product"".[322]
In 2008, game designer Sid Meier cited the Seal of Quality as one of the three most important innovations in video game history, as it helped set a standard for game quality that protected consumers from shovelware.[323]
In NTSC regions, this seal is an elliptical starburst named the ""Official Nintendo Seal"". Originally, for NTSC countries, the seal was a large, black and gold circular starburst. The seal read as follows: ""This seal is your assurance that NINTENDO has approved and guaranteed the quality of this product."" This seal was later altered in 1988: ""approved and guaranteed"" was changed to ""evaluated and approved"". In 1989, the seal became gold and white, as it currently appears, with a shortened phrase, ""Official Nintendo Seal of Quality"". It was changed in 2003 to read ""Official Nintendo Seal"".[322]
The seal currently reads:[324]
The official seal is your assurance that this product is licensed or manufactured by Nintendo. Always look for this seal when buying video game systems, accessories, games, and related products.In PAL regions, the seal is a circular starburst named the ""Original Nintendo Seal of Quality"". Text near the seal in the Australian Wii manual states:
This seal is your assurance that Nintendo has reviewed this product and that it has met our standards for excellence in workmanship, reliability, and entertainment value. Always look for this seal when buying games and accessories to ensure complete compatibility with your Nintendo product.[325]In 1992, Nintendo teamed with the Starlight Children's Foundation to build Starlight Fun Center mobile entertainment units and install them in hospitals.[326] By the end of 1995, 1,000 Starlight Nintendo Fun Center units were installed.[326] The units combine several forms of multimedia entertainment including gaming, and are a distraction as well as brightening moods and boosting children's morale during hospital stays.[327]
Nintendo has consistently been ranked last in Greenpeace's ""Guide to Greener Electronics"" due to Nintendo's failure to publish information.[328] Similarly, they are ranked last in the Enough Project's ""Conflict Minerals Company Rankings"" due to Nintendo's refusal to respond to multiple requests for information.[329]
Like many other electronics companies, Nintendo offers a recycling program for customers to mail in unused products. Nintendo of America claimed 548 tons of returned products in 2011, 98% of which became reused or recycled.[330]
""Nearly every generation, Nintendo has led a charge of innovation that has fundamentally reshaped the gaming world. These innovations haven't always been well received, but Nintendo's fingerprints are so firmly etched into our industry, that the company is arguably the most important figure in it.""
It is considered that Hiroshi Yamauchi's strategic decisions, mainly to take Nintendo into the world of electronic games, ensured not only the success of his company but the survival of the industry as a whole, as it ""restored public confidence in electronic games after the gloomy collapse of the U.S. market in the early 1980s"". The company was already the most successful in Japan by 1991, with its products having ""redefined the way we play games"" and its business model having prioritized title sales strategies over consoles, unlike what most distributors at the time were doing.[332]
Its social responsibility policy and philosophy focused on quality and innovation have already led to Nintendo being classified as a ""consumer-centric manufacturer"", something that has allowed it to differentiate itself from its direct competitors, Sony and Microsoft.[332] Forbes magazine has since 2013 included Nintendo in its list of the ""World's Best Employers"", which takes into consideration work environment and staff diversity.[333][334] Time magazine in turn chose Nintendo in 2018 as one of the ""50 Genius Companies"" of the year, saying that ""resurrection"" has become a ""habit"" of the company and highlighting the success of the Nintendo Switch over the Wii U.[335] Its capital in 2018 exceeded ten billion yen and net sales were over nine billion dollars, mostly in the North American market,[336] making it one of Japan's richest and most valuable companies.[337][182]
Nintendo characters have had a significant impact on contemporary popular culture. Mario has gone from being just a corporate mascot to a ""cultural icon"",[338] as well as one of the most famous characters in the industry. According to John Taylor of Arcadia Investment Corp. the character ""is by far the biggest single property in electronic gaming.""[339] Other prominent company characters include Princess Peach, Pikachu, Link,[340] Donkey Kong, Kirby, and Samus Aran.[341]

Future plc is a British publishing company. It was started in 1985 by Chris Anderson. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.
The company was founded by Chris Anderson as Future Publishing in Somerton, Somerset, England, with the sole magazine Amstrad Action in 1985.[2] An early innovation was the inclusion of free software on magazine covers.[2] It acquired GP Publications and established what would become Future US in 1994.[3]
Anderson sold the company to Pearson plc for £52.7m in 1994, but bought it back in 1998, for £142 million.[2] The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1999.[4] Anderson left the company in 2001.[5]
In 2004, the company was accused of corruption when it published positive reviews for the video game Driver 3 in two of its owned magazines, Xbox World and PSM2.[6]
Future published the official magazines for the consoles of all three major games console manufacturers (Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony); however PlayStation: The Official Magazine ceased publishing in November 2012, and Official Nintendo Magazine ceased publishing in October 2014.[7][8]
The chief executive and finance director both resigned at short notice after a profit warning in October 2011. It was noted that a re-structuring would be necessary as the company moved to a digital model.[9]
Future announced it would cut 55 jobs from its UK operation as part of a restructuring to adapt ""more effectively to the company's rapid transition to a primarily digital business model.""[10]  The company announced in March 2014 that it would close all of its U.S.-based print publications and shift U.S. print support functions such as consumer marketing, production and editorial leadership for Future's international print brands to the UK.[11] Later in 2014, Future sold its sport and craft titles to Immediate Media, and its auto titles to Kelsey Media.[12]
In April 2014, Zillah Byng-Thorne (then finance director) was appointed chief executive to replace Mark Wood, who had been in the position since 2011.[11]
In 2018, Future made further major acquisitions. It bought the What Hi-Fi?, FourFourTwo, Practical Caravan, and Practical Motorhome brands from Haymarket; and it acquired NewBay Media, publisher of numerous broadcast, professional-video, and systems-integration trade titles, as well as several consumer music magazines.[13] This acquisition returned most of the U.S. consumer music magazines to Future, with the exception of Revolver which had been sold to Project M Group in 2017.[14]
It bought the Purch Group for $132m by September 2018,[15][16] and in February 2019 bought Mobile Nations including the titles Android Central, iMore, Windows Central and Thrifter for $115 million.[17][18] Future also acquired Procycling and Cyclingnews.com from Immediate Media.[19] In July 2019 the company bought SmartBrief, a digital media publisher, for an initial sum of $45 million.[20]

In April 2020, it acquired TI Media with 41 brands for £140 million.[23] In November, it agreed to a £594m takeover of GoCo plc, known for its Gocompare.com price-comparison website.[24] In August 2021, it acquired Dennis Publishing and its 12 magazines, for £300 million.[25]
The company was criticised in February 2022 for the size of the remuneration package being offered to Zillah Byng-Thorne, the chief executive. It was noted that she could receive £40 million if the company performed well.[26]
Byng-Thorne resigned with effect from 3 April 2023 and was replaced as chief executive by Jon Steinberg.[27]
In April 2023, the company sold its shooting magazines including Shooting Times and Sporting Gun to Fieldsports Press.[28]
In August 2024, the company announced that its American trade papers Broadcasting & Cable and Multichannel News[29] would be closing after more than 90 years, with the main title  Broadcasting having been first published in 1931 and the merged title Multichannel News dating from 1980.[30] In October 2024, the company closed a number of consumer titles in the United Kingdom, including Play, All About Space, Total 911, and 3D World, with the monthly movie magazine Total Film[31][32] ceasing publication after 27 years.[33]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtua_Fighter_(video_game),Virtua Fighter (video game),"
Virtua Fighter[a] is a 1993 fighting game developed and published by Sega for arcades. It was developed for the Sega Model 1 arcade platform by AM2, a development group within Sega headed by Yu Suzuki. An early prototype version was location tested in Japan by August 1993, before the complete game was released worldwide in December 1993.[4] It was the first arcade fighting game to feature fully 3D polygon graphics. The game was ported to Sega Saturn as a global launch title in 1994 and 1995, and also received a port to the Sega 32X.
The game was critically acclaimed and a major hit, becoming one of Sega's best-selling arcade games of all time with more than 40,000 arcade units sold while the Saturn versions sold over 1 million copies. Virtua Fighter was highly regarded for its in-depth 3D fighting engine and real-world fighting techniques, and has been revolutionary and highly influential in the evolution of the genre and video games in general.[5][6] Its success led to the Virtua Fighter series, with its sequel Virtua Fighter 2 released in 1994.
In 1995, an update titled Virtua Fighter Remix was developed and released by AM1,[7] featuring drastic graphical improvements.[8] This improved version was quickly ported to the Saturn console[9] and later received a port to Windows. The game's remake, Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary, was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2003 as a standalone title in Japan and as a bonus in Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution in North America.
The Virtua label indicates that the onscreen action takes place in a 3D environment; however, movement is restricted to 2D. The graphics were made using wireframe and flat-shaded quad polygons. The game retains the fighting game staple of having multiple characters, each with their own distinctive moves.
In the game's single-player mode, the player faces all eight characters (including a duplicate of the chosen character) in a pre-determined order, followed by a fight with the game's boss, Dural. Each fight is a best-of-three match, and the player has three ways of winning: knocking out the opponent, forcing them out of the ring, or having more health left when time runs out.

Unlike other fighting games of the early 1990s (such as Street Fighter II or Mortal Kombat), the game relies on a control stick and only three buttons, punch, kick and guard (block), although different situations and button combinations led to a vast variety of moves for each character. An Arab fighter named Majido ""Siba"" Abdul was planned, and his character model appeared on some Virtua Fighter arcade cabinets (though, in some cases, Akira's name was placed under his portrait). Siba was originally to be the protagonist of the franchise. He was ultimately dropped, but later appeared in Fighters Megamix. Two other characters were also discovered. One was an early design of Akira Yuki, under an early name Takeru Ryushoji, who was shirtless and wore pants and shoes. The other was a military man named Jeffery ""Jeff"" Buckman.[citation needed], other fighters in the game that were planned to appear were the Koskol brothers Rekka (the eldest) Score (the middle) and Aeon (the youngest), these 6 fighters were part of an organization known as the ""Red Scorpions"", but was later scrapped.
Once in the Shōwa period, the defunct Japanese army intended to approach Puyi, the last Emperor of the Qing Dynasty in their effort to take advantages. However, they were defeated by the Imperial guards who used the martial art called Hakkyoku-ken. During World War II, the Japanese army research the mysteries of Hakkyoku-ken to create supersoldiers, developing the ultimate martial art.
Approximately half a century has passed since then, the ultimate World Fighting Tournament is about to start, and all kinds of fighters from around the world engage to determine the world's best. Behind the Tournament, however, there exists an intrigue designed by a sinister syndicate.
The game's development began in 1992, following the development of Virtua Racing.[10] Virtua Fighter was developed to run on Sega Model 1 arcade hardware,[11] developed internally at Sega.[12][13] According to Sega of Japan's publicity manager, Kurokawa, ""We deliberately didn't publicize all the [fighting] moves at the same time but instead revealed them to gamers one at a time by means of the Japanese videogame press.""[14] Virtua Fighter also used 3D motion capture technology.[15][16] Before Virtua Fighter, Sega AM3 simulated 3D using a creative method of sprite scaling on the 1993 arcade fighting game Dark Edge.[17]
According to Suzuki, an issue during the game's development was performing fast division calculations for 3D operations. The only applications he was aware of performing fast enough divisions at the time were nuclear reactors and space rockets. The team ""were working away with craftsmanship equivalent to inscribing 100 words on a single grain of rice"" to achieve fast 3D division operations, according to Suzuki.[18]
An early prototype version of the arcade game featured an Arab fighter called Siba. This early version did not have Akira Yuki, who was added later in development as a replacement for Siba, with Akira becoming the game's protagonist.[19] This early prototype version was location tested in Japan and then demonstrated at the Amusement Machine Show (AM Show) in August 1993.[20][21]
Virtua Fighter was a launch game for the Sega Saturn,[22] and served as the pack-in launch game in North America.[23] Its Sega 32X version was developed by the same team responsible for the Genesis port of Virtua Racing.[24]
Virtua Fighter Remix was an update of the original Virtua Fighter with higher-polygon models, texture mapping, and some gameplay changes. It was given free to all registered Saturn owners in the United States via mail.[8][25] It had an arcade release on the ST-V (an arcade platform based on the Sega Saturn) and later ported to Microsoft Windows as Virtua Fighter PC.[26] In Japan, Game Machine listed it on their August 1, 1995, issue as being the twenty-first most-successful arcade game of the month.[27]
With the 2003 PlayStation 2 release of Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution arriving in time for the series' tenth anniversary, a remake of Virtua Fighter, Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary, was released on the PlayStation 2. While the music, stages and low-polygon visual style were retained from the first game, the character roster, animations, mechanics and movesets were taken from Evolution. In the previous PS2 release of Virtua Fighter 4, a button code would make the player's character look like a Virtua Fighter model. In Japan, the game was included as part of a box set with a book called Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary: Memory of a Decade and a DVD. The box set was released in November 2003 and was published by Enterbrain.[28] In North America, the game was included in the home version of Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution, and in Europe it was only available as a promotional item; it was not sold at retail.
Sega began location testing an early prototype version in Japan prior to the game's demonstration at the Amusement Machine Show (AM Show) in August 1993. Sega reported it to be their highest-earning location test performance of all time, with each test machine earning a daily average of ¥60,000 or $600 (equivalent to $1,306 in 2024). At the 1993 AM Show, it was rated the ""hit of the show"" by many visitors.[20]
Upon the game's release in Japan, Game Machine listed Virtua Fighter as the country's most popular upright/cockpit arcade game of December 1993.[56] It went on to become Japan's highest-grossing arcade game of 1994,[57] and one of the country's highest-grossing arcade games of all time.[58] According to Next Generation magazine in 1995, Virtua Fighter was ""the biggest game in Japan since Super Mario World.""[5] In North America, RePlay reported Virtua Fighter to be the sixth most popular upright arcade game of February 1994;[59] it went on to be one of America's top five highest-grossing arcade games of 1994.[51] In the United Kingdom, it was the second top-grossing arcade game in London during early 1994 (below Ridge Racer),[60] and went on to be one of the most popular coin-ops of the year.[15]
Virtua Fighter sold more than 40,000 arcade units worldwide by 1996,[61] with each unit costing between $15,000 (equivalent to $33,000 in 2024)[15] and £14,000 / $21,000 (equivalent to $46,000 in 2024).[29] Virtua Fighter and Virtua Fighter 2 (1994) became Sega's best-selling arcade games of all time, surpassing their previous record holder Out Run (1986).[62]
Following its demonstration at the 1993 AM Show, Virtua Fighter received a positive industry reception. RePlay magazine called ""the adaptation of 3-D polygon graphics to video fighting games"" a ""sensational development that could define and revitalize this already-hot category."" California Games CEO Pat Schroeder said Virtua Fighter ""was by far the dawn of a new era of games"" with praise for the ""computerized 3-D graphics with effects that are unreal"" and how it ""shows the fighting action"" from different angles.[20] Edge magazine called Virtua Fighter ""a tantalising glimpse into the future of fighting games employing the same ground-breaking CG computer graphics system as Virtua Racing."" While criticizing the appearance of the ""excessively blocky polygonised people,"" Edge said ""the 3D scrolling, animation and movement are all silky-smooth and very realistic"" and that ""the fluid animation and imaginative camera angles quickly won the audience over.""[21] Electronic Gaming Monthly hailed Virtua Fighter as a demonstration of ""just how far video games have come in the last eight years."" EGM made particular note of the advanced graphics, how the camera moves along different axes depending on the fighters' location, the use of multiple viewpoints in the instant replay, the high quality of the gameplay, and the smoothness and realism of the animation.[32]
In January 1994, Rik Skews of Computer and Video Games magazine, after playing for 1 hour, initially praised the ""brilliant 64-bit"" 3D graphics, animation and camera work but compared the gameplay unfavorably to Street Fighter II.[29] Computer and Video Games was later more positive towards the gameplay, stating in December 1994 that the game ""combined cutting edge arcade technology with motion capture techniques and some excellent gameplay design.""[15] Next Generation said in 1995 that it epitomized Yu Suzuki's ""skill of finding the perfect blend of state-of-the-art technology with solid gameplay"" in ""the cut-throat world"" of arcades.[5]
The console port of Virtua Fighter, which was very close to the arcade game, sold at a nearly 1:1 ratio with the Saturn hardware during the Japanese launch.[63] The Future Publishing magazine Ultimate Future Games called Virtua Fighter the ""game that killed"" the 16-bit machines.[49] The Saturn version sold 630,000 units in Japan, while Remix sold a further 437,036 units there in 1995, for a combined total of 1,067,036 units sold for the Saturn in Japan.[64]
On release of the Saturn version, Sega Saturn Tsūshin scored the game a 38 out of 40.[48] Famicom Tsūshin's four critics would each score the same version a nine out of ten rating in December 1994.[35] Computer and Video Games reviewed a Japanese import in December 1994, stating ""the last machine to generate so much interest in this office was the arrival of"" the Super Famicom with Super Mario World. Steve James praised the ""superlative"" moves, ""amazingly crisp"" sound samples, and ""totally realistic"" action; Mark Patterson, while criticizing the high UK import price of £70–80 ($107–122), concluded with ""credit to Sega for producing an excellent machine, and even more to AM2 for its near-perfect conversion of this fantastic game.""[15] In a review of the Japanese release, GamePro praised the retention of the fighters, moves, varying camera angles, and controls of the arcade version, as well as the improved voice and sound effects and home version options, and concluded it to be ""one of the best games ever bundled with a system"".[65] Their later review of the North American release was similarly laudatory, but remarked that Tekken and Battle Arena Toshinden for the soon-to-launch PlayStation were even better.[66] Next Generation, which also reviewed the game prior to the Saturn's USA launch, disagreed, contending that ""What Virtua Fighter lacks in [Battle Arena] Tohshinden's immediate graphical punch, it makes up for in grinding longevity."" They particularly praised the game's depth and realism, and summarized that ""The Saturn Virtua Fighter is, to all intents and purposes, the coin-op game brought home. And away from the arcade, under the harsh light of unhurried examination, its merits grow.""[42]
Maximum gave it five out of five stars, calling it ""a stunningly close conversion that is quite possibly the best game available for the machine."" They remarked that the innovations such as the 3D motion capture remained impressive, as well as the depth and variety of the character's gameplay application: ""every fighter has almost limitless scope for coming up with all-new attacks."" They also praised the ""very clever mixture of superbly exaggerated sound effects coupled with a tangible, realistic impact for every blow.""[16] Electronic Gaming Monthly were more subdued in their reaction, but two of their four reviewers commented that it was nearly identical to the arcade version. They scored it 31.5 out of 40 (average 7.875 out of 10).[33] Edge rated the Saturn version 9/10, stating: ""Saturn Virtua Fighter has all the pulling power of the arcade version, including the swooping, gliding game camera, the stylish polygon characters, the totally convincing animation and the compulsive gameplay ... [The graphics] were impressive enough in the original, but on the Saturn, under the kind of intense scrutiny you can never give a game in the arcades, they emerge as simply astounding ... It's arguably the first true 'next generation' console game, fusing the best aspects of combat gameplay with groundbreaking animation and gorgeous sound"".[31]
Sega Saturn Magazine gave Virtua Fighter Remix five out of five stars, saying that it fixed the glitches and graphics of the original game while maintaining the already excellent gameplay.[47] Electronic Gaming Monthly scored Remix 29 out of 40 (average 7.25 out of 10). The reviewers praised all the game's improvements, but most of them concluded that it was still not worth buying for players who already owned the original game.[34] Maximum likewise praised the quality of the game and its low price tag, but felt it was not worth buying, with the release of the even better Saturn conversion of Virtua Fighter 2 less than a month away. They scored it four out of five stars.[67] The staff of Next Generation gave it five out of five stars, applauding the graphical improvements and glitch fixes. They commented: ""Perhaps never in videogame history has a problem such as Virtua Fighter been so quickly and thoroughly corrected. Virtua Fighter Remix contains all the great gameplay of the original without any of the weak spots.""[43] Scary Larry of GamePro gave the game a highly positive review for its graphical enhancements and retention of all the excellent gameplay of the original Saturn version. GamePro also ran two reader-submitted reviews for the game; King Kane argued that the graphical and audio improvements make the game worth trying even for those who are not fans of Virtua Fighter, while Tricky Ricky argued that though the game is an impressive upgrade, the lack of changes to the gameplay make its appeal quickly fade.[68] Famicom Tsūshin scored Virtua Fighter Remix a 35 out of 40,[69] and the Sega 32X version of the game a 30 out of 40.[36] Next Generation reviewed the arcade version of the game, and stated that ""The drawback of all Titan games, including Remix, is that the technology isn't as advanced, fast, or powerful as Model 2B [...] and these games are really like playing fast Saturn games in the arcade.""[9]
Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the 32X version 30.5 out of 40 (average 7.625 out of 10), calling it an excellent conversion given the system it's on, but dated next to the graphically superior Saturn version and especially Virtua Fighter Remix, both of which had already been released.[70] GamePro also noted that the 32X version suffers from more slowdown and fewer polygons than the Saturn version, as well as ""tinny sound quality"", but praised the additional options not included in the Saturn version and rated it as an overall strong port.[71] A critic for Next Generation similarly said that the 32X version is not as impressive looking as the Saturn version but has more options and fewer glitches, making it an overall excellent port. He argued that the game was not worth buying a 32X for, since the system was not powerful enough to handle ports of Virtua Fighter Remix or Virtua Fighter 2 (which was soon to be released for the Saturn), but that it was an essential purchase for those who already own a 32X.[44]
In 1995, Flux rated the arcade version 16th in its Top 100 Video Games. At the time, they called Virtua Fighter: ""The most satisfying fighter in existence.""[72] In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared Virtua Fighter PC the 121st-best computer game ever released.[54] In 1996, GamesMaster ranked Virtua Fighter eighth on their ""The GamesMaster Saturn Top 10.""[73]
Virtua Fighter dispensed with sprite-based graphics, replacing them with flat-shaded polygons rendered in real-time, by the Model 1's 3D-rendering hardware, allowing for effects and technologies that were impossible in sprite-based fighters, such as characters that could move in three dimensions, and a dynamic camera that could zoom, pan and swoop dramatically around the arena. It has been credited with both introducing and popularizing the use of polygon-based 3D graphics in fighting games.[74][75][76] Next Generation said in 1995 that Virtua Fighter was ""arguably the most significant game"" of the 1990s.[5] 1UP listed it as one of the 50 most important games of all time. They credited Virtua Fighter for creating the 3D fighting game genre, and more generally, demonstrating the potential of 3D polygon human characters (as the first to implement them in a useful way), showing the potential of realistic gameplay (introducing a character physics system and realistic character animations), and introducing fighting game concepts such as the ring-out and the block button.[6]
At a time when fighting games were becoming increasingly focused on violence and shock value, the popularity of Virtua Fighter demonstrated that fighting games focused on gameplay were still commercially viable.[75] Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto said that for several years after Virtua Fighter was released he was disinterested in making fighting games because he felt that ""I was beaten to the punch when Virtua Fighter came out"", and that any fighting game he produced would have been perceived as an attempt to copy Virtua Fighter.[77] Game designer Yasuyuki Oda remarked that he was impressed by this video game while working for SNK.[78] In particular, Virtua Fighter garnered praise for its simple three-button control scheme, with the game's strategy coming from the intuitively observed differences between characters that felt and acted differently rather than the more ornate combos of two-dimensional competitors. Virtua Fighter's fluid animation and relatively realistic depiction of distinct fighting styles gave its combatants a lifelike presence considered impossible to replicate with sprites.[79][80][81]
Virtua Fighter played a crucial role in popularizing 3D polygonal graphics.[74][82][83] Some of the Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) staff involved in the creation of the original PlayStation video game console credit Virtua Fighter as inspiration for the PlayStation's 3D graphics hardware. According to SCE's former producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, the PlayStation was originally being considered as a 2D focused hardware, and it was not until the success of Virtua Fighter in the arcades that they decided to design the PlayStation as a 3D focused hardware.[84] Toby Gard also cited Virtua Fighter as an influence on the use of polygon characters—and the creation of Lara Croft—in Tomb Raider: ""It became clear to me watching people play Virtua Fighter, which was kind of the first big 3D-character console game, that even though there were only two female characters in the lineup, in almost every game I saw being played, someone was picking one of the two females.""[85] John Romero also cited Virtua Fighter as a major influence on the creation of 3D first-person shooter Quake.[86][87] Team Ico's Fumito Ueda also cited Virtua Fighter as an influence on his animation work.[88]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_the_Beholder_(video_game),Eye of the Beholder (video game),"
Eye of the Beholder is a role-playing video game for personal computers and video game consoles developed by Westwood Associates. It was published by Strategic Simulations, Inc. in 1991,[3][4] for the MS-DOS operating system and later ported to the Amiga, the Sega CD and the Super NES. The Sega CD version features a soundtrack composed by Yuzo Koshiro and Motohiro Kawashima.[5][6] A port to the Atari Lynx handheld was developed by NuFX in 1993, but was not released.[7] In 2002, an adaptation of the same name was developed by Pronto Games for the Game Boy Advance.
The game has two sequels: the first was Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon, which was also released in 1991; after Westwood Studios was acquired by Virgin Interactive in 1992, Eye of the Beholder III: Assault on Myth Drannor was released in 1993. The third game, however, was not developed by Westwood, who instead went on to create the Lands of Lore series.
The lords of the city of Waterdeep hire a team of adventurers to investigate an evil coming from beneath the city. The adventurers enter the city's sewer, but the entrance gets blocked by a collapse caused by Xanathar, the eponymous beholder. The team descends further beneath the city, going through Dwarf and Drow clans, to Xanathar's lair, where the final confrontation takes place.
Once the eponymous beholder is killed, the player would be treated to a small blue window describing that the beholder was killed and that the adventurers returned to the surface where they were treated as heroes. Nothing else was mentioned in the ending and there were no accompanying graphics. This was changed in the later released Amiga version, which featured an animated ending.
Eye of the Beholder features a first-person perspective in a dungeon rendered using 3D computer graphics,[8] very similar to the earlier Dungeon Master.[9] The player controls four characters, initially, using a point-and-click interface to fight monsters.[8] This can be increased to a maximum of six characters, by resurrecting one or more skeletons from dead non-player characters (NPCs), or finding NPCs that are found throughout the dungeons.
The possibility to increase the size of the player's party through the recruiting of NPCs was a tradition in all of the Eye of the Beholder series. It was also possible to import a party from Eye of the Beholder into The Legend of Darkmoon or from The Legend of Darkmoon into Assault on Myth Drannor; thus, a player could play through all three games with the same party.
The graphics for the MS-DOS version were created using Deluxe Paint. Over 150 Adlib sound effects exist in the game's audio.[10]
Eye of the Beholder was reviewed in 1991 in Dragon #171 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in ""The Role of Computers"" column, who gave it 5 out of 5 stars.[14] It was #1 on the Software Publishers Association's list of top MS-DOS games for April 1991, the last SSI D&D game to reach the rank.[21] Dennis Owens of Computer Gaming World called it ""a stunning, brilliantly graphic and agonizingly tricky"" 3-D CRPG. The magazine stated that the game's VGA graphics and sound card audio finally gave IBM PC owners a Dungeon Master-like game.[22] Scorpia, another reviewer for the magazine, was less positive. Although also praising the graphics and audio, stating that they ""really give you the feeling of being in an actual dungeon"", she criticized the awkward spell user interface and the ""outrageous"" abrupt ending. Other areas that needed work included the combat, plot, and NPC interaction; nonetheless, she was hopeful that with such improvements ""the Legend series will become one of the leaders in the CRPG field"".[23] In 1993, Scorpia called the game ""an impressive first effort that bodes well for the future"".[24]
Jim Trunzo reviewed Eye of the Beholder in White Wolf #27 (June/July, 1991), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that ""While the unforgiving nature of Eye of the Beholder makes the basic dungeon crawl a challenge, the graphics and sound employed in the game might well make it a classic!""[25]
The One gave the Amiga version of Eye of the Beholder an overall score of 92%, heavily comparing it to Dungeon Master, stating that ""comparisons to the [aging] classic – Dungeon Master – are inevitable. When two games look this similar, even their programmers would have trouble telling them apart"". The One praises Eye of the Beholder's gameplay, stating that ""in contrast to previous AD&D titles, there's more emphasis on puzzle-solving than combat – a refreshing change ... Combat is also handled extremely well, the spells and 'ranged weapons' rules are all faithful to the original game ... The gameplay works wonderfully, conjuring up both the spirit and the atmosphere that you get from [tabletop AD&D]"". Despite this, The One expresses that Eye of the Beholder is on par with Dungeon Master and Chaos Strikes Back, but states that Eye of the Beholder is still ""an essential purchase for followers of the AD&D series"".[18]
Hailing the game as ""a dream come true"" for Dungeons & Dragons fans, Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Super NES version a 6.2 out of 10, praising its 3-D graphics and variety of characters.[16] They gave the Sega CD version a 7.2 out of 10, this time praising the ability to create custom characters but criticizing the audio. They also remarked that the game has a difficult learning curve.[15] While reviewing the Sega CD version, Computer and Video Games said it is ""not quite up there with Snatcher, but without doubt a highly ace role-player"".[13]
According to GameSpy in 2004, despite the issues in the first Eye of the Beholder, ""most players found the game well worth the effort"".[26] IGN ranked Eye of the Beholder No. 8 on their list of ""The Top 11 Dungeons & Dragons Games of All Time"" in 2014.[27] Ian Williams of Paste rated the game #8 on his list of ""The 10 GreatestDungeons and Dragons Videogames"" in 2015.[28] In 1991, PC Format placed Eye of the Beholder on its list of the 50 best computer games of all time. The editors called it a ""classic romp through dungeons dealing with monsters, puzzles, traps and things mythical"".[29]
SSI sold 129,234 copies of Eye of the Beholder. By mid-1991, over 150,000 copies had been sold worldwide.[30] The Eye of the Beholder series overall, including the game's two sequels, reached global sales above 350,000 units by 1996.[31]
In January 1991, SSI participated in Computer Gaming World's Top Ad contest and their cover art for Eye of the Beholder came in first place among voting readers, despite the magazine publisher's objection to the piece.[32] From February till October, SSI started up a contest ""Beholder Bonus"", which required players to find a bonus feature (easter egg) in each level of the game, indicated by an onscreen message. The first 50 PC players and 50 Amiga players to discover all 12 features would win $100 worth of prizes.[33][34]
There were two sequels:
Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon used a modified version of the first game's engine, added outdoor areas and greatly increased the amount of interaction the player had with their environment, along with substantially more 'roleplaying' aspects to the game.
Eye of the Beholder III: Assault on Myth Drannor was not developed by Westwood, the developer of Eye of the Beholder and The Legend of Darkmoon, but rather in-house by the publisher SSI.
Eye of the Beholder Trilogy (1995, SSI) was a rerelease of all the three games for MS-DOS on CD-ROM. Interplay released the three games along with a number of other AD&D DOS Games in two collection CDs: The Forgotten Realms Archives (1997) and Gamefest: Forgotten Realms Classics (2001).
Several modules for Neverwinter Nights (2002) have been created by fans as remakes of the original Eye of the Beholder game.[35][36] A team of Indie game developers led by Andreas Larsson did a fan conversion of the game for the Commodore 64 available for free as a cartridge image.[37]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Siege_of_Dragonspear,Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear,"
Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear is an expansion pack for the role-playing video game Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition developed and published by Beamdog. The expansion was the first new original content to the Baldur's Gate series released after more than 10 years, and its plot takes place between the events of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. Gameplay remained similar to Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, although a class, companions and areas have been added. Siege of Dragonspear received mixed reviews by video game publications who appreciated the return to the franchise after a long hiatus. It received backlash from some consumers who criticized the general quality of the writing and the introduction of a transgender non-playable character.
Like Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, Siege of Dragonspear follows the rules of the 2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, licensed by Wizards of the Coast.
The game takes place shortly after the conclusion of Baldur's Gate and centers on a mysterious crusade to the north of Baldur's Gate city, led by a warrior named Caelar Argent who is known as the Shining Lady.
The story begins several weeks after Sarevok's death, with the player character's party hunting the remains of Sarevok's forces in the sewers and catacombs of the city. Shortly after, word arrives in the city of Caelar Argent's crusade, warning that she is making her way down along the Sword Coast and threatening the city. The player is sent with a contingent of Flaming Fist soldiers (sent by Duke Eltan) to halt Argent's advance at Dragonspear Castle. The company is joined by forces from several other major cities of the Coast who are also threatened by Argent's crusade. Throughout the journey, the player is visited by a hooded man who teaches the player more about his heritage and how to use it.
The main river crossing is destroyed by Caelar's forces, and the coalition is forced to cross at the last standing bridge along the river where Bhaal, the player character's father, had been killed by the mad god Cyric years earlier. After driving Argent's forces back, the player suffers a vision of Bhaal's death and burns his symbol into the bridge, lowering the morale of the coalition soldiers. The player's party must sneak into Dragonspear Castle and learn what they can about Argent and gather intel on her forces. Inside the castle, the player character discovers Argent's chief lieutenant communicating with an unknown source before they are discovered and forced to leave the castle without gathering any information.
The coalition attacks Dragonspear castle after successfully repelling an attack from Caelar's army, and destroys most of her forces. Caelar is trapped in the keep, so she has her chief lieutenant Hephernaan cast a paralysis spell over the whole keep. However, his spell traps Caelar as well and his true intentions are revealed: he planned to use the Bhaalspawn's blood to open the portal to the Nine Hells to unleash his master and his army upon the Material Plane. Caelar and her surviving men, along with the player character and their party, travel into the portal to stop Hephernaan. It is revealed that Hephernaan's master is Belhifet, a demon who was cast into the Nine Hells as punishment one hundred years prior. After defeating him and Hephernaan, Argent reveals that her true intention was to free her uncle from the Nine Hells and all the death that has occurred has been in pursuit of retrieving him. Caelar stays behind to seal the portal, trapping herself in the Nine Hells forever as punishment for her actions.
The player character returns to the Material Plane and the coalition celebrates Caelar's defeat at Dragonspear. Later that night, the player character suffers a nightmare of an avatar of Bhaal attacking him. It is revealed that the ""avatar"" was Skie Silvershield, a companion from the first game and the only child of Grand Duke Entar Silvershield, one of the dukes of Baldur's Gate. The player character is arrested and dragged back to the city in irons. Many call for him to be executed, but Grand Duke Belt informs the player character that he will be smuggled out of the city in order to avoid execution as a reward for all the service that he has done for the city. After escaping the city, the player character is met by Imoen, Minsc, Dynaheir, Khalid, and Jaheira, who promise to always travel with them. Shortly after, they are ambushed by unseen figures, setting up the beginning of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. It is also revealed that the hooded man is Jon Irenicus, the antagonist of the second game.
Siege of Dragonspear was revealed in July 2015, during a live event hosted by Beamdog as a bridge between the events of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.[1] Trent Oster, game director and co-founder of Beamdog, described the development of the game as: ""We move from custodian to creator"", and the intention of the expansion was to rival to Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast and Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal expansions. Oster said that Siege of Dragonspear is bigger than the two previous expansions combined, taking the player occupied for at least 25 hours of play across 70 new areas and that introduces a new monster summoning class called ""The Shaman"", and adds 4 new companions to complement the original roster of characters that can be imported from Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.[2][3][4] In addition, Oster said that there are several improvements to the UI including the addition of health bars and journal pop-up entries.[5]
Oster admitted that recovering all original voice actors, to reprise their original roles, was not simple since some of them left the industry, but Ginny McSwain, the voice director for the original Baldur's Gate, managed to recreate a performance as faithful as possible working with them.[4] Since the fact that the Forgotten Realms of Baldur's Gate belongs to the 2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, they were a very different place to that of the most recent edition, so game writers Amber Scott and Andrew Foley did a very complicated job to make sure that the plot of Siege of Dragonspear matches the canon of second edition.[4]
Skybound Games, a division of Skybound Entertainment, released the game to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on October 15, 2019.[6][7]
Siege of Dragonspear was released on March 31, 2016, and received mixed reviews.[8] Hayden Dingman of PC World was generally positive to the game, praising the gameplay and updated visuals, but was critical to combat system.[12] Jason Wilson of VentureBeat's GamesBeat appreciated the will of Beamdog to do more than just re-releasing enhanced version of great classics, and liked to return to the Forgotten Realms to see the long-unforeseen events between Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.[11]
More stringent were Destructoid and PC Gamer's opinions on Siege of Dragonspear. Patrick Hancock, of Destructoid, defined the game to be ""fun as an experience"" although ""there could be some hard-to-ignore faults"".[10] Phil Savage of PC Gamer, wrote that ""Beamdog has proven they can continue the Baldur's Gate story"" but defined their work as a mere replication of ""the antiquated nature of the Baldur's Gate games"".[9]
GameStar offers a more negative opinion, strongly criticising the writing of the main story by pointing out plot holes, illogical changes to the recurring characters from the first Baldur's Gate and a ""bizarre soap opera ending"". The publication also took issue with the graphical changes which make the game look ""cartoony"" as well as numerous bugs and crashes occurring during the review.[13]
Parts of the game's writing attracted some negative initial reviews on Steam and GOG.com, with Eurogamer's Robert Purchese reporting that criticism focused on two scenes. The first is the character Minsc's quip, ""Really, it's about ethics in heroic adventuring"", a reference to the Gamergate controversy. The second is an optional dialogue tree in which the cleric Mizhena mentions that she was raised as a boy, indicating that she is a trans woman.[14] Colin Campbell of Polygon reported that writer Amber Scott faced online harassment and insults, and that the game's Steam and GOG.com pages were bombarded with complaints that the transgender reference constituted ""political correctness"", ""LGBT tokenism"" and ""SJW pandering"".[15] Scott said that she wanted to address elements in the original Baldur's Gate that she considered sexist, including its depictions of Safana as a ""sex object"" and Jaheira as a ""nagging wife"" played for comedy.[16] She had previously commented: ""I get to make decisions about who I write about and why. I don't like writing about straight/white/cis people all the time. It's not reflective of the real world, it sets up s/w/c as the 'normal' baseline from which 'other' characters must be added, and it's boring"".[17]
Five days after the expansion's release, Jeff Grubb of VentureBeat reported that 142 people had posted negative user reviews on Metacritic, the vast majority giving a score of ""zero"", and suggested that a mob of gamers were attempting to review bomb the expansion for adding diversity.[18] Ed Greenwood, creator of the Forgotten Realms game world in which the Baldur's Gate series takes place, defended the inclusion of a transgender character.[15] Trent Oster also defended this decision.[19]
On an April 2016 post discussing both technical and content issues, Beamdog revealed that they will remove the Gamergate joke and expand Mizhena's story.[20] To this effect, the 2.5 patch added a new quest, given by Mizhena; the dialogue tree where Mizhena indicate being a trans woman is now after the player has completed the quest, rather than the first time the player meets Mizhena.[21] Paul Tumburro of CraveOnline termed this as ""spineless and disappointing"" stating that Beamdog's founder Trent Oster refused to acknowledge the transphobic criticisms leveled at the game.[22]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot,GameSpot,"
GameSpot is an American video gaming website that provides news, reviews, previews, downloads, and other information on video games. The site was launched on May 1, 1996, created by Pete Deemer, Vince Broady, and Jon Epstein. In addition to the information produced by GameSpot staff, the site also allows users to write their own reviews, blogs, and post on the site's forums. It has been owned by Fandom, Inc. since October 2022.[2]
In 2004, GameSpot won ""Best Gaming Website"" as chosen by the viewers in Spike TV's second Video Game Award Show,[3] and has won Webby Awards several times. The domain GameSpot.com attracted at least 60 million visitors annually by October 2008 according to a Compete.com study.[4]
In January 1996, Pete Deemer, Vince Broady, and Jon Epstein quit their positions at IDG and founded SpotMedia Communications.[5][6][7] SpotMedia then launched GameSpot on May 1, 1996.[7] Originally, GameSpot focused solely on personal computer games, so a sister site, VideoGameSpot, was launched on December 1, 1996.[7][8] Eventually VideoGameSpot, then renamed VideoGames.com, was merged into GameSpot.[8]
On January 6, 1997, SpotMedia and publisher Ziff Davis announced a $20 million agreement allowing the publisher to run content from Computer Gaming World and Electronic Gaming Monthly on SpotMedia's websites.[9] By the following month, Ziff Davis's substantial financial infusion enabled GameSpot to grow to 45 employees.[7] Upon the May 11, 1998 launch of Ziff Davis's cable channel ZDTV, a program by GameSpot was projected for a mid-summer release,[10] and would premiere as GameSpot TV on July 4.[11] In February 1999, PC Magazine named GameSpot one of the hundred best websites, alongside competitors IGN and CNET Gamecenter.[12]
On July 19, 2000, CNET announced its acquisition of ZDNET, putting GameSpot and Gamecenter under the same parent company.[13] That December, The New York Times declared GameSpot and Gamecenter the ""Time and Newsweek of gaming sites"".[14] In February 2001, GameSpot was spared from a redundancy reduction effort by CNET which shuttered Gamecenter.[15][16]
In October 2005, GameSpot adopted a new design similar to that of TV.com, now considered a sister site to GameSpot.[17] GameSpot ran a few different paid subscriptions from 2006 to 2013, but is no longer running those.[18][19][20] In June 2008, GameSpot's parent company CNET was acquired by CBS Corporation, and GameSpot along with CNET's other online assets were managed by the CBS Interactive division.[21]
A new layout change was adopted in October 2013.[citation needed]
CNET was sold to Red Ventures in October 2020.[22] Two years later, Fandom acquired GameSpot, along with Metacritic, TV Guide, GameFAQs, Giant Bomb, Cord Cutters News, and Comic Vine from Red Ventures.[2][23] In January 2023, 40-50 employees were affected by a round of layoffs.[24] More layoffs at GameSpot took place in January 2024.[25]
GameSpot UK (United Kingdom) was started in October 1997 and operated until mid-2002, offering content that was oriented for the British market that often differed from that of the U.S. site. During this period, GameSpot UK won the 1999 PPAi (Periodical Publishers Association interactive) award for best website,[26] and was short listed in 2001.[27] PC Gaming World was considered a ""sister print magazine"" and some content appeared on both GameSpot UK and PC Gaming World.[28] Following the purchase of ZDNet by CNET, GameSpot UK was merged with the main US site. On April 24, 2006, GameSpot UK was relaunched.[29]
In a similar fashion, GameSpot AU (Australia) existed on a local scale in the late 1990s with Australian-produced reviews. It ceased in 2003. When a local version of the main CNET portal, CNET.com.au was launched in 2003, GameSpot AU content was folded into CNET.com.au. The site was fully re-launched in mid-2006, with a specialized forum, local reviews, special features, local pricings in Australian dollars, Australian release dates, and more local news.[citation needed]
Jeff Gerstmann, editorial director of the site, was fired on November 28, 2007 as a result of pressure from Eidos Interactive, a major advertiser; Eidos objected to the 6/10 review that Gerstmann had given Kane & Lynch: Dead Men, a game they were heavily advertising on GameSpot at the time.[30][31][32] Both GameSpot and parent company CNET initially stated that his dismissal was unrelated to the review.[33][34] However, in March 2012, the non-disclosure agreement that forced Gerstmann to withhold the details of his termination was nullified. Not long after, Giant Bomb (a site Gerstmann founded after leaving GameSpot) was being purchased by the same parent company as GameSpot, and that they moved their headquarters into the same building. As part of this announcement, Gerstmann revealed that the firing was indeed related to threats of Eidos pulling advertising revenue away from GameSpot as a result of Gerstmann's poor review score, which was confirmed by GameSpot's Jon Davison.[30][31]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre,Louvre,"
The Louvre,[a] or the Louvre Museum (French: Musée du Louvre [myze dy luvʁ] ⓘ), is a national art museum in Paris, France, and the most visited museum in the world[6]. It is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement (district) and home to some of the most canonical works of Western art, including the Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, and Winged Victory. The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built in the late 12th to 13th century under Philip II. Remnants of the Medieval Louvre fortress are visible in the basement of the museum. Due to urban expansion, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function, and in 1546 Francis I converted it into the primary residence of the French kings.[7]
The building was redesigned and extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture.[8] In 1692, the building was occupied by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons. The Académie remained at the Louvre for 100 years.[9] During the French Revolution, the National Assembly decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum to display the nation's masterpieces.  The palace and exhibition space was expanded in the 19th century and again in the 20th.
The museum opened on 10 August 1793 with an exhibition of 537 paintings, the majority of the works being royal and confiscated church property. Because of structural problems with the building, the museum was closed from 1796 until 1801. The collection was increased under Napoleon, after the Napoleonic looting of art in Europe, Egypt, and Syria, and the museum was renamed Musée Napoléon, but after Napoleon's abdication, many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners.[citation needed] The collection was further increased during the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X, and during the Second French Empire the museum gained 20,000 pieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and bequests since the Third Republic. The collection is divided into eight departments: Egyptian Antiquities; Near Eastern Antiquities; Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities; Islamic Art; Sculpture; Decorative Arts; Paintings; Prints and Drawings.
The Musée du Louvre contains approximately 500,000 objects[10] and displays 35,000 works of art in eight curatorial departments with more than 60,600 m2 (652,000 sq ft) dedicated to the permanent collection.[2] The Louvre exhibits sculptures, objets d'art, paintings, drawings, and archaeological finds. At any given point in time, approximately 38,000 objects from prehistory to the 21st century are being exhibited over an area of 72,735 m2 (782,910 sq ft), making it the largest museum in the world. It received 8.7 million visitors in 2024,  ranking it as the most-visited art museum, and most-visited museum of any category, in the world.[11]
The Louvre museum is located inside the Louvre Palace, in the centre of Paris, adjacent to the Tuileries Gardens. The two nearest Métro stations are Louvre–Rivoli and Palais Royal–Musée du Louvre, the latter having a direct underground access to the Carrousel du Louvre commercial mall.[12]
Before the Grand Louvre overhaul of the late 1980s and 1990s, the Louvre had several street-level entrances, most of which are now permanently closed. Since 1993, the museum's main entrance has been the underground space under the Louvre Pyramid, or Hall Napoléon, which can be accessed from the Pyramid itself, from the underground Carrousel du Louvre, or (for authorised visitors) from the passage Richelieu connecting to the nearby rue de Rivoli. A secondary entrance at the Porte des Lions, near the western end of the Denon Wing, was created in 1999 but is not permanently open.[13]
The museum's entrance conditions have varied over time. Prior to the 1850s, artists and foreign visitors had privileged access. At the time of initial opening in 1793, the French Republican calendar had imposed ten-day ""weeks"" (French: décades), the first six days of which were reserved for visits by artists and foreigners and the last three for visits by the general public.[14]: 37  In the early 1800s, after the seven-day week had been reinstated, the general public had only four hours of museum access per week, between 2pm and 4pm on Saturdays and Sundays.[15]: 8  In 1824, a new regulation allowed public access only on Sundays and holidays; the other days the museum was open only to artists and foreigners, except for closure on Mondays.[14]: 39  That changed in 1855 when the museum became open to the public all days except Mondays.[14]: 40  It was free until 1922, when an entrance fee was introduced except on Sundays.[14]: 42  Since its post-World War II reopening in 1946,[14]: 43  the Louvre has been closed on Tuesdays, and habitually open to the public the rest of the week except for some holidays.
The use of cameras and video recorders is permitted inside, but flash photography is forbidden.[16]
Beginning in 2012, Nintendo 3DS portable video game systems were used as the official museum audio guides. The following year, the museum contracted Nintendo to create a 3DS-based audiovisual visitor guide.[17] Entitled Nintendo 3DS Guide: Louvre, it contains over 30 hours of audio and over 1,000 photographs of artwork and the museum itself, including 3D views,[18] and also provides navigation thanks to differential GPS transmitters installed within the museum.[19]
The upgraded 2013 Louvre guide was also announced in a special Nintendo Direct featuring Satoru Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto demonstrating it at the museum,[20] and 3DS XLs pre-loaded with the guide are available to rent at the museum.[21] The 3DS Louvre guide was scheduled to be retired in September 2025 and will be replaced by a different guide system.[22]
The Louvre Palace, which houses the museum, was begun by King Philip II in the late 12th century to protect the city from the attack from the west, as the Kingdom of England still held Normandy at the time. Remnants of the Medieval Louvre are still visible in the crypt.[23]: 32  Whether this was the first building on that spot is not known, and it is possible that Philip modified an existing tower.[24]
The origins of the name ""Louvre"" are somewhat disputed. According to the authoritative Grand Larousse encyclopédique, the name derives from an association with a wolf hunting den (via Latin: lupus, lower Empire: lupara).[24][25] In the 7th century, Burgundofara (also known as Saint Fare), abbess in Meaux, is said to have given part of her ""Villa called Luvra situated in the region of Paris"" to a monastery,[26] even though it is doubtful that this land corresponded exactly to the present site of the Louvre.
The Louvre Palace has been subject to numerous renovations since its construction. In the 14th century, Charles V converted the building from its military role into a residence. In 1546, Francis I started its rebuilding in French Renaissance style.[27] After Louis XIV chose Versailles as his residence in 1682, construction works slowed to a halt. The royal move away from Paris resulted in the Louvre being used as a residence for artists, under Royal patronage.[27][23]: 42 [28] For example, four generations of craftsmen-artists from the Boulle family were granted Royal patronage and resided in the Louvre.[29][30][31]
Meanwhile, the collections of the Louvre originated in the acquisitions of paintings and other artworks by the monarchs of the House of France. At the Palace of Fontainebleau, Francis collected art that would later be part of the Louvre's art collections, including Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.[32]
The Cabinet du Roi consisted of seven rooms west of the Galerie d'Apollon on the upper floor of the remodelled Petite Galerie. Many of the king's paintings were placed in these rooms in 1673, when it became an art gallery, accessible to certain art lovers as a kind of museum. In 1681, after the court moved to Versailles, 26 of the paintings were transferred there, somewhat diminishing the collection, but it is mentioned in Paris guide books from 1684 on, and was shown to ambassadors from Siam in 1686.[33]
By the mid-18th century there were proposals to create a public gallery in the Louvre. Art critic Étienne La Font de Saint-Yenne in 1747 published a call for a display of the royal collection. On 14 October 1750, Louis XV decided on a display of 96 pieces from the royal collection, mounted in the Galerie royale de peinture of the Luxembourg Palace. A hall was opened by Le Normant de Tournehem and the Marquis de Marigny for public viewing of the ""king's paintings"" (Tableaux du Roy) on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The Luxembourg gallery included Andrea del Sarto's Charity and works by Raphael; Titian; Veronese; Rembrandt; Poussin or Van Dyck. It closed in 1780 as a result of the royal gift of the Luxembourg palace to the Count of Provence (the future king, Louis XVIII) by the king in 1778.[34] Under Louis XVI, the idea of a royal museum in the Louvre came closer to fruition.[35] The comte d'Angiviller broadened the collection and in 1776 proposed to convert the Grande Galerie of the Louvre – which at that time contained the plans-reliefs or 3D models of key fortified sites in and around France – into the ""French Museum"". Many design proposals were offered for the Louvre's renovation into a museum, without a final decision being made on them. Hence the museum remained incomplete until the French Revolution.[34]
The Louvre finally became a public museum during the French Revolution. In May 1791, the National Constituent Assembly declared that the Louvre would be ""a place for bringing together monuments of all the sciences and arts"".[34] On 10 August 1792, Louis XVI was imprisoned and the royal collection in the Louvre became national property. Because of fear of vandalism or theft, on 19 August, the National Assembly pronounced the museum's preparation urgent. In October, a committee to ""preserve the national memory"" began assembling the collection for display.[36]
The museum opened on 10 August 1793, the first anniversary of the monarchy's demise, as Muséum central des Arts de la République. The public was given free access on three days per week, which was ""perceived as a major accomplishment and was generally appreciated"".[38] The collection showcased 537 paintings and 184 objects of art. Three-quarters were derived from the royal collections, the remainder from confiscated émigrés and Church property (biens nationaux).[39][23]: 68-69  To expand and organise the collection, the Republic dedicated 100,000 livres per year.[34] In 1794, France's revolutionary armies began bringing pieces from Northern Europe, augmented after the Treaty of Tolentino (1797) by works from the Vatican, such as the Laocoön and Apollo Belvedere, to establish the Louvre as a museum and as a ""sign of popular sovereignty"".[39][40]
The early days were hectic. Privileged artists continued to live in residence, and the unlabelled paintings hung ""frame to frame from floor to ceiling"".[39] The museum closed in May 1796 due to structural deficiencies. It reopened on 14 July 1801, arranged chronologically and with new lighting and columns.[39] On 15 August 1797, the Galerie d'Apollon was opened with an exhibition of drawings. Meanwhile, the Louvre's Gallery of Antiquity sculpture (musée des Antiques), with artefacts brought from Florence and the Vatican, had opened in November 1800 in Anne of Austria's former summer apartment, located on the ground floor just below the Galerie d'Apollon. 
On 19 November 1802, Napoleon appointed Vivant Denon, a scholar and polymath who had participated in the Egyptian campaign of 1798–1801, as the museum's first director, in preference to alternative contenders such as antiquarian Ennio Quirino Visconti, painter Jacques-Louis David, sculptor Antonio Canova and architects Léon Dufourny or Pierre Fontaine.[41] On Denon's suggestion in July 1803, the museum itself was renamed Musée Napoléon.[42]: 79 
The collection grew through successful military campaigns.[23]: 52  Acquisitions were made of Spanish, Austrian, Dutch, and Italian works, either as the result of war looting or formalised by treaties such as the Treaty of Tolentino.[43] At the end of Napoleon's First Italian Campaign in 1797, the Treaty of Campo Formio was signed with Count Philipp von Cobenzl of the Austrian Monarchy. This treaty marked the completion of Napoleon's conquest of Italy and the end of the first phase of the French Revolutionary Wars. It compelled Italian cities to contribute pieces of art and heritage to Napoleon's ""parades of spoils"" through Paris before being put into the Louvre Museum.[44] The Horses of Saint Mark, which had adorned the basilica of San Marco in Venice after the sack of Constantinople in 1204, were brought to Paris where they were placed atop Napoleon's Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in 1797.[44] Under the Treaty of Tolentino, the two statues of the Nile and Tiber were taken to Paris from the Vatican in 1797, and were both kept in the Louvre until 1815. (The Nile was later returned to Rome,[45] whereas the Tiber has remained in the Louvre to this day.) The despoilment of Italian churches and palaces outraged the Italians and their artistic and cultural sensibilities.[46]
After the French defeat at Waterloo, the looted works' former owners sought their return. The Louvre's administrator, Denon, was loath to comply in absence of a treaty of restitution. In response, foreign states sent emissaries to London to seek help, and many pieces were returned, though far from all.[43][23]: 69 [47] In 1815 Louis XVIII finally concluded agreements with the Austrian government[48][49] for the keeping of works such as Veronese's Wedding at Cana which was exchanged for a large Le Brun or the repurchase of the Albani collection.
For most of the 19th century, from Napoleon's time to the Second Empire, the Louvre and other national museums were managed under the monarch's civil list and thus depended much on the ruler's personal involvement. Whereas the most iconic collection remained that of paintings in the Grande Galerie, a number of other initiatives mushroomed in the vast building, named as if they were separate museums even though they were generally managed under the same administrative umbrella. Correspondingly, the museum complex was often referred to in the plural (""les musées du Louvre"") rather than singular.[50]
During the Bourbon Restoration (1814–1830), Louis XVIII and Charles X added to the collections. The Greek and Roman sculpture gallery on the ground floor of the southwestern side of the Cour Carrée was completed on designs by Percier and Fontaine. In 1819 an exhibition of manufactured products was opened in the first floor of the Cour Carrée's southern wing and would stay there until the mid-1820s.[42]: 87  Charles X in 1826 created the Musée Égyptien and in 1827 included it in his broader Musée Charles X, a new section of the museum complex located in a suite of lavishly decorated rooms on the first floor of the South Wing of the Cour Carrée. The Egyptian collection, initially curated by Jean-François Champollion, formed the basis for what is now the Louvre's Department of Egyptian Antiquities. It was formed from the purchased collections of Edmé-Antoine Durand, Henry Salt and the second collection of Bernardino Drovetti (the first one having been purchased by Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia to form the core of the present Museo Egizio in Turin). The Restoration period also saw the opening in 1824 of the Galerie d'Angoulême, a section of largely French sculptures on the ground floor of the Northwestern side of the Cour Carrée, many of whose artefacts came from the Palace of Versailles and from Alexandre Lenoir's Musée des Monuments Français following its closure in 1816. Meanwhile, the French Navy created an exhibition of ship models in the Louvre in December 1827, initially named musée dauphin in honour of Dauphin Louis Antoine,[51] building on an 18th-century initiative of Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau. This collection, renamed musée naval in 1833 and later to develop into the Musée national de la Marine, was initially located on the first floor of the Cour Carrée's North Wing, and in 1838 moved up one level to the 2nd-floor attic, where it remained for more than a century.[52]
Following the July Revolution, King Louis Philippe focused his interest on the repurposing of the Palace of Versailles into a Museum of French History conceived as a project of national reconciliation, and the Louvre was kept in comparative neglect. Louis-Philippe did, however, sponsor the creation of the musée assyrien to host the monumental Assyrian sculpture works brought to Paris by Paul-Émile Botta, in the ground-floor gallery north of the eastern entrance of the Cour Carrée. The Assyrian Museum opened on 1 May 1847.[53] Separately, Louis-Philippe had his Spanish gallery displayed in the Louvre from 7 January 1838, in five rooms on the first floor of the Cour Carrée's East (Colonnade) Wing,[54] but the collection remained his personal property. As a consequence, the works were removed after Louis-Philippe was deposed in 1848, and were eventually auctioned away in 1853.
The short-lived Second Republic had more ambitions for the Louvre. It initiated repair work, the completion of the Galerie d'Apollon and of the salle des sept-cheminées, and the overhaul of the Salon Carré (former site of the iconic yearly Salon) and of the Grande Galerie.[23]: 52  In 1848, the Naval Museum in the Cour Carrée's attic was brought under the common Louvre Museum management,[52] a change which was again reversed in 1920. In 1850 under the leadership of curator Adrien de Longpérier, the musée mexicain opened within the Louvre as the first European museum dedicated to pre-Columbian art.[55]
The rule of Napoleon III was transformational for the Louvre, both the building and the museum. In 1852, he created the Musée des Souverains in the Colonnade Wing, an ideological project aimed at buttressing his personal legitimacy. In 1861, he bought 11,835 artworks including 641 paintings, Greek gold and other antiquities of the Campana collection. For its display, he created another new section within the Louvre named Musée Napoléon III, occupying a number of rooms in various parts of the building. Between 1852 and 1870, the museum added 20,000 new artefacts to its collections.[56]

The main change of that period was to the building itself. In the 1850s architects Louis Visconti and Hector Lefuel created massive new spaces around what is now called the Cour Napoléon, some of which (in the South Wing, now Aile Denon) went to the museum.[23]: 52-54  In the 1860s, Lefuel also led the creation of the pavillon des Sessions with a new Salle des Etats closer to Napoleon III's residence in the Tuileries Palace, with the effect of shortening the Grande Galerie by about a third of its previous length. A smaller but significant Second Empire project was the decoration of the salle des Empereurs below the Salon carré.[citation needed] The Louvre narrowly escaped serious damage during the suppression of the Paris Commune. On 23 May 1871, as the French Army advanced into Paris, a force of Communards led by Jules Bergeret [fr] set fire to the adjoining Tuileries Palace. The fire burned for forty-eight hours, entirely destroying the interior of the Tuileries and spreading to the north west wing of the museum next to it. The emperor's Louvre library (Bibliothèque du Louvre) and some of the adjoining halls, in what is now the Richelieu Wing, were separately destroyed. But the museum was saved by the efforts of Paris firemen and museum employees led by curator Henry Barbet de Jouy.[57]
Following the end of the monarchy, several spaces in the Louvre's South Wing went to the museum. The Salle du Manège was transferred to the museum in 1879, and in 1928 became its main entrance lobby.[58] The large Salle des Etats that had been created by Lefuel between the Grande Galerie and Pavillon Denon was redecorated in 1886 by Edmond Guillaume [fr], Lefuel's successor as architect of the Louvre, and opened as a spacious exhibition room.[59][60] Edomond Guillaume also decorated the first-floor room at the northwest corner of the Cour Carrée, on the ceiling of which he placed in 1890 a monumental painting by Carolus-Duran, The Triumph of Marie de' Medici originally created in 1879 for the Luxembourg Palace.[60]
Meanwhile, during the Third Republic (1870–1940) the Louvre acquired new artefacts mainly via donations, gifts, and sharing arrangements on excavations abroad. The 583-item Collection La Caze, donated in 1869 by Louis La Caze, included works by Chardin; Fragonard, Rembrandt and Watteau.[23]: 70-71  In 1883, the Winged Victory of Samothrace, which had been found in the Aegean Sea in 1863, was prominently displayed as the focal point of the Escalier Daru.[23]: 70-71  Major artefacts excavated at Susa in Iran, including the massive Apadana capital and glazed brick decoration from the Palace of Darius there, accrued to the Oriental (Near Eastern) Antiquities Department in the 1880s. The Société des amis du Louvre was established in 1897 and donated prominent works, such as the Pietà of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon. The expansion of the museum and its collections slowed after World War I, however, despite some prominent acquisitions such as Georges de La Tour's Saint Thomas and Baron Edmond de Rothschild's 1935 donation of 4,000 prints, 3,000 drawings, and 500 illustrated books.
From the late 19th century, the Louvre gradually veered away from its mid-century ambition of universality to become a more focused museum of French, Western and Near Eastern art, covering a space ranging from Iran to the Atlantic. The collections of the Louvre's musée mexicain were transferred to the Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro in 1887. As the Musée de Marine was increasingly constrained to display its core naval-themed collections in the limited space it had in the second-floor attic of the northern half of the Cour Carrée, many of its significant holdings of non-Western artefacts were transferred in 1905 to the Trocadéro ethnography museum, the National Antiquities Museum in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and the Chinese Museum in the Palace of Fontainebleau.[61] The Musée de Marine itself was relocated to the Palais de Chaillot in 1943. The Louvre's extensive collections of Asian art were moved to the Guimet Museum in 1945. Nevertheless, the Louvre's first gallery of Islamic art opened in 1893.[62]
In the late 1920s, Louvre Director Henri Verne devised a master plan for the rationalisation of the museum's exhibitions, which was partly implemented in the following decade. In 1932–1934, Louvre architects Camille Lefèvre [fr] and Albert Ferran redesigned the Escalier Daru to its current appearance. The Cour du Sphinx in the South Wing was covered by a glass roof in 1934. Decorative arts exhibits were expanded in the first floor of the North Wing of the Cour Carrée, including some of France's first period room displays. In the late 1930s, The La Caze donation was moved to a remodelled Salle La Caze above the salle des Caryatides, with reduced height to create more rooms on the second floor and a sober interior design by Albert Ferran.[citation needed]
During World War II, the Louvre conducted an elaborate plan of evacuation of its art collection. When Germany occupied the Sudetenland, many important artworks such as the Mona Lisa were temporarily moved to the Château de Chambord. When war was formally declared a year later, most of the museum's paintings were sent there as well. Select sculptures such as Winged Victory of Samothrace and the Venus de Milo were sent to the Château de Valençay.[64] On 27 August 1939, after two days of packing, truck convoys began to leave Paris. By 28 December, the museum was cleared of most works, except those that were too heavy and ""unimportant paintings [that] were left in the basement"".[65] In early 1945, after the liberation of France, art began returning to the Louvre.[66]
New arrangements after the war revealed the further evolution of taste away from the lavish decorative practices of the late 19th century. In 1947, Edmond Guillaume's ceiling ornaments were removed from the Salle des Etats,[60] where the Mona Lisa was first displayed in 1966.[67] Around 1950, Louvre architect Jean-Jacques Haffner [fr] streamlined the interior decoration of the Grande Galerie.[60] In 1953, a new ceiling by Georges Braque was inaugurated in the Salle Henri II, next to the Salle La Caze.[68] In the late 1960s, seats designed by Pierre Paulin were installed in the Grande Galerie.[69] In 1972, the Salon Carré's museography was remade with lighting from a hung tubular case, designed by Louvre architect Marc Saltet [fr] with assistance from designers André Monpoix [fr], Joseph-André Motte and Paulin.[70]
In 1961, the Finance Ministry accepted to leave the Pavillon de Flore at the southwestern end of the Louvre building, as Verne had recommended in his 1920s plan. New exhibition spaces of sculptures (ground floor) and paintings (first floor) opened there later in the 1960s, on a design by government architect Olivier Lahalle.[71]
In 1981, French President François Mitterrand proposed, as one of his Grands Projets, the Grand Louvre plan to relocate the Finance Ministry, until then housed in the North Wing of the Louvre, and thus devote almost the entire Louvre building (except its northwestern tip, which houses the separate Musée des Arts Décoratifs) to the museum which would be correspondingly restructured. In 1984 I. M. Pei, the architect personally selected by Mitterrand, proposed a master plan including an underground entrance space accessed through a glass pyramid in the Louvre's central Cour Napoléon.[23]: 66 
The open spaces surrounding the pyramid were inaugurated on 15 October 1988, and its underground lobby was opened on 30 March 1989. New galleries of early modern French paintings on the 2nd floor of the Cour Carrée, for which the planning had started before the Grand Louvre, also opened in 1989. Further rooms in the same sequence, designed by Italo Rota, opened on 15 December 1992.[citation needed]
On 18 November 1993, Mitterrand inaugurated the next major phase of the Grand Louvre plan: the renovated North (Richelieu) Wing in the former Finance Ministry site, the museum's largest single expansion in its entire history, designed by Pei, his French associate Michel Macary, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte. Further underground spaces known as the Carrousel du Louvre, centred on the Inverted Pyramid and designed by Pei and Macary, had opened in October 1993. Other refurbished galleries, of Italian sculptures and Egyptian antiquities, opened in 1994. The third and last main phase of the plan unfolded mainly in 1997, with new renovated rooms in the Sully and Denon wings. A new entrance at the porte des Lions opened in 1998, leading on the first floor to new rooms of Spanish paintings.[citation needed]
As of 2002, the Louvre's visitor count had doubled from its pre-Grand-Louvre levels.[72]
President Jacques Chirac, who had succeeded Mitterrand in 1995, insisted on the return of non-Western art to the Louvre, upon a recommendation from his friend the art collector and dealer Jacques Kerchache [fr]. On his initiative, a selection of highlights from the collections of what would become the Musée du Quai Branly – Jacques Chirac was installed on the ground floor of the Pavillon des Sessions and opened in 2000, six years ahead of the Musée du Quai Branly itself.
The main other initiative in the aftermath of the Grand Louvre project was Chirac's decision to create a new department of Islamic Art, by executive order of 1 August 2003, and to move the corresponding collections from their prior underground location in the Richelieu Wing to a more prominent site in the Denon Wing. That new section opened on 22 September 2012, together with collections from the Roman-era Eastern Mediterranean, with financial support from the Al Waleed bin Talal Foundation and on a design by Mario Bellini and Rudy Ricciotti.[73][74][75]
In 2007, German painter Anselm Kiefer was invited to create a work for the North stairs of the Perrault Colonnade, Athanor. This decision announces the museum's reengagement with contemporary art under the direction of Henri Loyrette, fifty years after the institution's last order to a contemporary artists, George Braque.[76]
In 2010, American painter Cy Twombly completed a new ceiling for the Salle des Bronzes (the former Salle La Caze), a counterpoint to that of Braque installed in 1953 in the adjacent Salle Henri II. The room's floor and walls were redesigned in 2021 by Louvre architect Michel Goutal to revert the changes made by his predecessor Albert Ferran in the late 1930s, triggering protests from the Cy Twombly Foundation on grounds that the then-deceased painter's work had been created to fit with the room's prior decoration.[77]
That same year, the Louvre commissioned French artist François Morellet to create a work for the Lefuel stairs, on the first floor. For L'esprit d'escalier Morellet redesigned the stairscase's windows, echoing their original structures but distorting them to create a disturbing optical effect.[78]
On 6 June 2014, the Decorative Arts section on the first floor of the Cour Carrée's northern wing opened after comprehensive refurbishment.[79]
In January 2020, under the direction of Jean-Luc Martinez, the museum inaugurated a new contemporary art commission, L'Onde du Midi by Venezuelan kinetic artist Elias Crespin. The sculpture hovers under the Escalier du Midi, the staircase on the South of the Perrault Colonnade.[80]
The Louvre, like many other museums and galleries, felt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage. The museum closed after the end of the day on 29 February 2020,[81] and it did not reopen until 6 July.[82] The museum operated with limited capacity until 29 October, when it was ordered closed again due to an increase in COVID cases in France,[83] and reopened on 19 May 2021.[84] As a result, the museum recorded only 2.7 million visitors in 2020, down from 9.6 million in 2019 and a record 10.2 million in 2018.[85]
In preparation for the 2024 Olympics, the Louvre staged an exhibit about the Games' history that links their ancient beginnings to the modern era.[86]
Attendance rose to 8.9 million in 2023, 14 percent above 2022, but still short of the record of 10.2 million in 2018.[87]
In January 2025, French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans for a renovation and expansion of the Louvre, including a room solely for the Mona Lisa. The planned renovation and expansion was a result of the increasing number of visitors each year to the Louvre.[88] On 16 June 2025, the museum's employees went on strike in protest against chronic issues such as overcrowding, understaffing and ""untenable"" working conditions.[89][90]
On 19 October 2025, the Louvre was subjected to a robbery through a forced window in the Galerie d'Apollon. The museum reported that jewellery had been stolen, and the perpetrators fled by motorbike.[91] They used a construction platform left by the building to enter a window and leave with their score.[92] The museum was closed for the day.[93] French interior minister Laurent Nuñez said the robbery involved intruders entering the museum via a basket lift using a platform mounted on a lorry and then cut into the window using what appeared to be angle grinders.[94] Nine major pieces of jewellery from the crowns of France were taken in a few minutes.[95] Eight pieces were stolen, including an emerald necklace that belonged to Empress Marie-Louise and three jewels that belonged to queens Marie-Amelie and Hortense.[96] The ninth item, the Crown of Empress Eugénie, was recovered the same day in a street close to the Louvre but in a damaged condition.[97]
On 25 October, two of the suspected thieves were arrested, one was trying to fly to Algeria from Charles de Gaulle Airport.[98]On 29 October, the prosecutor in charge said that they had ""partially admitted"" to their involvement in the heist. She added that the jewels were yet to be recovered.[99]On the same day, five additional suspects were arrested, but only one of them was allegedly part of the four-man heist team.[100]
On 30 October, police arrested five more suspects, but there was still no sign of the stolen jewels.[101]
The Musée du Louvre owns 615,797 objects[1] of which 482,943 are accessible online since 24 March 2021[102] and displays 35,000 works of art in eight curatorial departments.[2]
The Louvre is home to one of the world's most extensive collections of art, including works from diverse cultures and time periods. Visitors can view iconic works like the Mona Lisa and the Winged Victory of Samothrace, as well as pieces from ancient civilisations such as Egypt, Greece, and Rome. The museum also features collections of decorative arts, Islamic art, and sculptures.[103]
The department, comprising over 50,000 pieces,[23]: 74  includes artefacts from the Nile civilisations which date from 4,000 BC to the 4th century AD.[104] The collection, among the world's largest, overviews Egyptian life spanning Ancient Egypt, the Middle Kingdom, the New Kingdom, Coptic art, and the Roman, Ptolemaic, and Byzantine periods.[104]
The department's origins lie in the royal collection, but it was augmented by Napoleon's 1798 expeditionary trip with Dominique Vivant, the future director of the Louvre.[23]: 76-77  After Jean-François Champollion translated the Rosetta Stone, Charles X decreed that an Egyptian Antiquities department be created. Champollion advised the purchase of three collections, formed by Edmé-Antoine Durand, Henry Salt, and Bernardino Drovetti; these additions added 7,000 works. Growth continued via acquisitions by Auguste Mariette, founder of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Mariette, after excavations at Memphis, sent back crates of archaeological finds including The Seated Scribe.[23]: 76-77 [105]
Guarded by the Great Sphinx of Tanis, the collection is housed in more than 20 rooms. Holdings include art, papyrus scrolls, mummies, tools, clothing, jewellery, games, musical instruments, and weapons.[23]: 76-77 [104] Pieces from the ancient period include the Gebel el-Arak Knife from 3400 BC, The Seated Scribe, and the Head of King Djedefre. Middle Kingdom art, ""known for its gold work and statues"", moved from realism to idealisation; this is exemplified by the schist statue of Amenemhatankh and the wooden Offering Bearer. The New Kingdom and Coptic Egyptian sections are deep, but the statue of the goddess Nephthys and the limestone depiction of the goddess Hathor demonstrate New Kingdom sentiment and wealth.[104][105]
Near Eastern antiquities, the second newest department, dates from 1881 and presents an overview of early Near Eastern civilisation and ""first settlements"", before the arrival of Islam. The department is divided into three geographic areas: the Levant, Mesopotamia (Iraq), and Persia (Iran). The collection's development corresponds to archaeological work such as Paul-Émile Botta's 1843 expedition to Khorsabad and the discovery of Sargon II's palace.[104][23]: 119  These finds formed the basis of the Assyrian museum, the precursor to today's department.[104]
The museum contains exhibits from Sumer and the city of Akkad, with monuments such as the Prince of Lagash's Stele of the Vultures from 2450 BC and the stele erected by Naram-Sin, King of Akkad, to celebrate a victory over barbarians in the Zagros Mountains. The 2.25-metre (7.38 ft) Code of Hammurabi, discovered in 1901, displays Babylonian Laws prominently, so that no man could plead their ignorance. The 18th-century BC mural of the Investiture of Zimrilim and the 25th-century BC Statue of Ebih-Il found in the ancient city-state of Mari are also on display at the museum.[106]
A significant portion of the department covers the ancient Levant, including the Sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II discovered in 1855, which catalysed Ernest Renan's 1860 Mission de Phénicie. It contains one of the world's largest and most comprehensive collections of Canaanite and Aramaic inscriptions. The section also covers North African Punic antiquities (Punic = Western Phoenician), given the significant French presence in the region in the 19th century, with early finds including the 1843 discovery of the Ain Nechma inscriptions.
The Persian portion of Louvre contains work from the archaic period, like the Funerary Head and the Persian Archers of Darius I,[104][107] and rare objects from Persepolis.[108]
The Greek, Etruscan, and Roman department displays pieces from the Mediterranean Basin dating from the Neolithic to the 6th century.[109] The collection spans from the Cycladic period to the decline of the Roman Empire. This department is one of the museum's oldest, and contains works acquired by Francis I.[104][23]: 155-58  Initially, the collection focused on marble sculptures, such as the Venus de Milo. Works such as the Apollo Belvedere arrived during the Napoleonic Wars, of which some were returned after Napoleon I's fall in 1815. Other works, such as the Borghese Vase, were bought by Napoleon. Later in the 19th century, the Louvre acquired works including vases from the Durand collection and bronzes.[23]: 92 [109]
The archaic is demonstrated by jewellery and pieces such as the limestone Lady of Auxerre, from 640 BC; and the cylindrical Hera of Samos, c. 570–560 BC.[104][110] After the 4th century BC, focus on the human form increased, exemplified by the Borghese Gladiator. The Louvre holds masterpieces from the Hellenistic era, including The Winged Victory of Samothrace (190 BC) and the Venus de Milo, symbolic of classical art.[23]: 155  The long Galerie Campana displays an outstanding collection of more than one thousand Greek potteries. In the galleries paralleling the Seine, much of the museum's Roman sculpture is displayed.[109] The Roman portraiture is representative of that genre; examples include the portraits of Agrippa and Annius Verus; among the bronzes is the Greek Apollo of Piombino.
The Islamic art collection, the museum's newest, spans ""thirteen centuries and three continents"".[112] These exhibits, of ceramics, glass, metalware, wood, ivory, carpet, textiles, and miniatures, include more than 5,000 works and 1,000 shards.[113] Originally part of the decorative arts department, the holdings became separate in 2003. Among the works are the Pyxide d'al-Mughira, a 10th century ivory box from Andalusia; the Baptistery of Saint-Louis, an engraved brass basin from the 13th or 14th century Mamluk period; and the 10th century Shroud of Saint-Josse from Iran.[23]: 119-121 [112] The collection contains three pages of the Shahnameh, an epic book of poems by Ferdowsi in Persian, and a Syrian metalwork named the Barberini Vase.[113] In September 2019, a new and improved Islamic art department was opened by Princess Lamia bint Majed Al Saud. The new department exhibits 3,000 pieces were collected from Spain to India via the Arabian peninsula dating from the 7th to the 19th centuries.[114]
The sculpture department consists of works created before 1850 not belonging in the Etruscan, Greek, and Roman department.[115] The Louvre has been a repository of sculpted material since its time as a palace; however, only ancient architecture was displayed until 1824, except for Michelangelo's Dying Slave and Rebellious Slave.[23]: 397-401  Initially the collection included only 100 pieces, the rest of the royal sculpture collection being at Versailles. It remained small until 1847, when Léon Laborde was given control of the department. Laborde developed the medieval section and purchased the first such statues and sculptures in the collection, King Childebert and stanga door, respectively.[23]: 397-401  The collection was part of the Department of Antiquities but was given autonomy in 1871 under Louis Courajod, a director who organised a wider representation of French works.[115][23]: 397-401  In 1986, all post-1850 works were relocated to the new Musée d'Orsay. The Grand Louvre project separated the department into two exhibition spaces; the French collection is displayed in the Richelieu Wing, and foreign works in the Denon Wing.[115]
The collection's overview of French sculpture contains Romanesque works such as the 11th-century Daniel in the Lions' Den and the 12th-century Virgin of Auvergne. In the 16th century, Renaissance influence caused French sculpture to become more restrained, as seen in Jean Goujon's bas-reliefs, and Germain Pilon's Descent from the Cross and Resurrection of Christ. The 17th and 18th centuries are represented by Gian Lorenzo Bernini's 1640–1 Bust of Cardinal Richelieu, Étienne Maurice Falconet's Woman Bathing and Amour menaçant, and François Anguier's obelisks. Neoclassical works includes Antonio Canova's Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss (1787).[23]: 397-401  The 18th and 19th centuries are represented by the French sculptors like Alfred Barye and Émile Guillemin.
The Objets d'art collection spans the time from the Middle Ages to the mid-19th century. The department began as a subset of the sculpture department, based on royal property and the transfer of work from the Basilique Saint-Denis, the burial ground of French monarchs that held the Coronation Sword of the Kings of France.[116][23]: 451-454  Among the budding collection's most prized works were pietre dure vases and bronzes. The Durand collection's 1825 acquisition added ""ceramics, enamels, and stained glass"", and 800 pieces were given by Pierre Révoil. The onset of Romanticism rekindled interest in Renaissance and Medieval artwork, and the Sauvageot donation expanded the department with 1,500 middle-age and faïence works. In 1862, the Campana collection added gold jewellery and maiolicas, mainly from the 15th and 16th centuries.[23]: 451-454 [117]
The works are displayed on the Richelieu Wing's first floor and in the Apollo Gallery, named by the painter Charles Le Brun, who was commissioned by Louis XIV (the Sun King) to decorate the space in a solar theme. The medieval collection contains the coronation crown of Louis XV, Charles V's sceptre, and the 12th century porphyry vase.[118] The Renaissance art holdings include Giambologna's bronze Nessus and Deianira and the tapestry Maximillian's Hunt.[116] From later periods, highlights include Madame de Pompadour's Sèvres vase collection and Napoleon III's apartments.[116]
In September 2000, the Louvre Museum dedicated the Gilbert Chagoury and Rose-Marie Chagoury Gallery to display tapestries donated by the Chagourys, including a 16th-century six-part tapestry suite, sewn with gold and silver threads representing sea divinities, which was commissioned in Paris for Colbert de Seignelay, Secretary of State for the Navy.
The painting collection has more than 7,500 works[14]: 229  from the 13th century to 1848 and is managed by 12 curators who oversee the collection's display. Nearly two-thirds are by French artists, and more than 1,200 are Northern European. The Italian paintings compose most of the remnants of Francis I and Louis XIV's collections, others are unreturned artwork from the Napoleon era, and some were bought.[122][23]: 199-201, 272–273, 333–335  The collection began with Francis, who acquired works from Italian masters such as Raphael and Michelangelo[123] and brought Leonardo da Vinci to his court.[32][124] After the French Revolution, the Royal Collection formed the nucleus of the Louvre. When the d'Orsay train station was converted into the Musée d'Orsay in 1986, the collection was split, and pieces completed after the 1848 Revolution were moved to the new museum. French and Northern European works are in the Richelieu Wing and Cour Carrée; Spanish and Italian paintings are on the first floor of the Denon Wing.[23]: 199 
Exemplifying the French School are the early Avignon Pietà of Enguerrand Quarton; the anonymous painting of King Jean le Bon (c. 1360), possibly the oldest independent portrait in Western painting to survive from the postclassical era;[23]: 201  Hyacinthe Rigaud's Louis XIV; Jacques-Louis David's The Coronation of Napoleon; Théodore Géricault's The Raft of the Medusa; and Eugène Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People. Nicolas Poussin, the Le Nain brothers, Philippe de Champaigne, Le Brun, La Tour, Watteau, Fragonard, Ingres, Corot, and Delacroix are well represented.[125]
Northern European works include Johannes Vermeer's The Lacemaker and The Astronomer; Caspar David Friedrich's The Tree of Crows; Rembrandt's The Supper at Emmaus, Bathsheba at Her Bath, and The Slaughtered Ox.
The Italian holdings are notable, particularly the Renaissance collection.[126] The works include Andrea Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini's Calvarys, which reflect realism and detail ""meant to depict the significant events of a greater spiritual world"".[127] The High Renaissance collection includes Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, Virgin and Child with St. Anne, St. John the Baptist, and Madonna of the Rocks. The Baroque collection includes Giambattista Pittoni's The Continence of Scipio, Susanna and the Elders, Bacchus and Ariadne, Mars and Venus, and others Caravaggio is represented by The Fortune Teller and Death of the Virgin. From 16th century Venice, the Louvre displays Titian's Le Concert Champetre, The Entombment, and The Crowning with Thorns.[23]: 378 [128]
The La Caze Collection, a bequest to the Musée du Louvre in 1869 by Louis La Caze, was the largest contribution of a person in the history of the Louvre. La Caze gave 584 paintings of his personal collection to the museum. The bequest included Antoine Watteau's Commedia dell'arte player of Pierrot (""Gilles""). In 2007, this bequest was the topic of the exhibition ""1869: Watteau, Chardin... entrent au Louvre. La collection La Caze"".[129]
Some of the best known paintings of the museum have been digitised by the French Centre for Research and Restoration of Museums of France.[130]
The prints and drawings department encompasses works on paper.[23]: 496  The origins of the collection were the 8,600 works in the Royal Collection (Cabinet du Roi), which were increased via state appropriation, purchases such as the 1,200 works from Fillipo Baldinucci's collection in 1806, and donations.[23]: 92 [131] The department opened on 5 August 1797, with 415 pieces displayed in the Galerie d'Apollon. The collection is organised into three sections: the core Cabinet du Roi, 14,000 royal copper printing-plates, and the donations of Edmond de Rothschild,[132] which include 40,000 prints, 3,000 drawings, and 5,000 illustrated books. The holdings are displayed in the Pavillon de Flore; due to the fragility of the paper medium, only a portion are displayed at one time.[23]: 496 
The Louvre is owned by the French government. Since the 1990s, its management and governance have been made more independent.[133][134][135][136] Since 2003, the museum has been required to generate funds for projects.[135] By 2006, government funds had dipped from 75 percent of the total budget to 62 percent. Every year, the Louvre now raises as much as it gets from the state, about €122 million. The government pays for operating costs (salaries, safety, and maintenance), while the rest – new wings, refurbishments, acquisitions – is up to the museum to finance.[137] A further €3 million to €5 million a year is raised by the Louvre from exhibitions that it curates for other museums, while the host museum keeps the ticket money.[137] As the Louvre became a point of interest in the book The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the book, the museum earned $2.5 million by allowing filming in its galleries.[138][139] In 2008, the French government provided $180 million of the Louvre's yearly $350 million budget; the remainder came from private contributions and ticket sales.[134]
The Louvre employs a staff of 2,000 led by Director Jean-Luc Martinez,[140] who reports to the French Ministry of Culture and Communications. Martinez replaced Henri Loyrette in April 2013. Under Loyrette, who replaced Pierre Rosenberg in 2001, the Louvre has undergone policy changes that allow it to lend and borrow more works than before.[133][135] In 2006, it loaned 1,300 works, which enabled it to borrow more foreign works. From 2006 to 2009, the Louvre lent artwork to the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia, and received a $6.9 million payment to be used for renovations.[135]
In 2009, Minister of culture Frédéric Mitterrand approved a plan that would have created a storage facility 30 km (19 mi) northwest of Paris to hold objects from the Louvre and two other national museums in Paris's flood zone, the Musée du Quai Branly and the Musée d'Orsay; the plan was later scrapped. In 2013, his successor Aurélie Filippetti announced that the Louvre would move more than 250,000 works of art[141] held in a 20,000 square metres (220,000 sq ft) basement storage area in Liévin; the cost of the project, estimated at €60 million, will be split between the region (49%) and the Louvre (51%).[142] The Louvre will be the sole owner and manager of the store.[141] In July 2015, a team led by British firm Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners was selected to design the complex, which will have light-filled work spaces under one vast, green roof.[141][143]
In 2012, the Louvre and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco announced a five-year collaboration on exhibitions, publications, art conservation and educational programming.[144][145] The €98.5 million expansion of the Islamic Art galleries in 2012 received state funding of €31 million, as well as €17 million from the Alwaleed Bin Talal Foundation founded by the eponymous Saudi prince. The Republic of Azerbaijan, the Emir of Kuwait, the Sultan of Oman and King Mohammed VI of Morocco donated in total €26 million. In addition, the opening of the Louvre Abu Dhabi is supposed to provide €400 million over the course of 30 years for its use of the museum's brand.[73] Loyrette has tried to improve weak parts of the collection through income generated from loans of art and by guaranteeing that ""20% of admissions receipts will be taken annually for acquisitions"".[135] He has more administrative independence for the museum and achieved 90 percent of galleries to be open daily, as opposed to 80 percent previously. He oversaw the creation of extended hours and free admission on Friday nights and an increase in the acquisition budget to $36 million from $4.5 million.[134][135]
In March 2018, an exhibition of dozens of artworks and relics belonging to France's Louvre Museum was opened to visitors in Tehran, as a result of an agreement between Iranian and French presidents in 2016.[146] In the Louvre, two departments were allocated to the antiquities of the Iranian civilisation, and the managers of the two departments visited Tehran. Relics belonging to Ancient Egypt, Rome and Mesopotamia as well as French royal items were showcased at the Tehran exhibition.[147][148][149]
Iran's National Museum building was designed and constructed by French architect André Godard.[150] Following its time in Tehran, the exhibition is set to be held in the Khorasan Grand Museum in Mashhad, northeastern Iran in June 2018.[151]
On the 500th anniversary of Leonardo da Vinci's death, the Louvre held the largest ever single exhibit of his work, from 24 October 2019 to 24 February 2020.[152][153] The event included over a hundred items: paintings, drawings and notebooks. A full 11 of the fewer than 20 paintings that Da Vinci completed in his lifetime were displayed.[154] Five of them are owned by the Louvre, but the Mona Lisa was not included because it is in such great demand among visitors to the Louvre museum; the work remained on display in its gallery. Salvator Mundi was also not included since the Saudi owner did not agree to move the work from its hiding place. Vitruvian Man, however, was on display, after a successful legal battle with its owner, the Galleria dell'Accademia in Venice.[155][156]
In 2021, a Renaissance era ceremonial helmet and breastplate stolen from the museum in 1983 were recovered. The museum noted that the 1983 theft had ""deeply troubled all the staff at the time."" There are few publicly accessible details on the theft itself.[157][158]
The current director of the Louvre is Laurence des Cars, who was selected by French president Emmanuel Macron in 2021.[159][160] She is the first woman to hold this position.[161]
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Louvre has launched a digital platform where most of its works, including those that are not on display, can be seen. The database includes more than 482,000 illustrated records, representing 75% of the Louvre's collections.[162] The museum was visited by over 7.6 million visitors in 2022, up 170 percent from 2021, but still below the 10.8 million visitors in 2018 before the COVID-19 pandemic.[163]
In 2023, the Louvre Museum in Paris implemented a significant change in its pricing policy, marking the first price increase since 2017.[164] The decision to raise ticket prices by 30% is part of a broader strategy aimed at supporting free entry during the Olympics and effectively managing the anticipated crowd. Director Laurence des Cars has introduced measures to regulate attendance, including capping daily visitors at 30,000 and planning a new entrance to alleviate congestion. These efforts are geared towards ensuring a top-notch experience for art enthusiasts during the Olympic Games, as the museum expects to host approximately 8.7 million visitors this year, with a remarkable 80% seeking to view the Mona Lisa.
The Louvre's ancient art collections are to a significant extent the product of excavations, some of which the museum sponsored under various legal regimes over time, often as a companion to France's diplomacy and colonial enterprises. In the Rotonde d'Apollon, a carved marble panel lists a number of such campaigns, led by:
The rest of the plaque combines donors of archaeological items, many of whom were archaeologists themselves, and other archaeologists whose excavations contributed to the Louvre's collections:
Several museums in and outside France have been or are placed under the Louvre's administrative authority or linked to it through exclusive partnerships, while not being located in the Louvre Palace. Since 2019, the Louvre has also maintained a large art storage and research facility in the Northern French town of Liévin, the Centre de conservation du Louvre [fr], which is not open to the public.[165]
In February 1926, the Musée de Cluny, whose creation dates back to the 19th century, was brought under the aegis of the Louvre's department of decorative arts (Objets d'Art).[166] That affiliation was terminated in 1977.[167]
The Jeu de Paume building in the Tuileries Garden, initially intended as a sports venue, was repurposed from 1909 as an art gallery. In 1947, it became the exhibition space for the Louvre's collections of late 19th and early 20th paintings, most prominently Impressionism, as the Louvre Palace was lacking space to display them, and was consequently brought under direct management by the Louvre's Département des Peintures. In 1986, these collections were transferred to the newly created Musée d'Orsay.[168]
The Musée du Petit Palais opened in 1976 in the former urban mansion of the archbishops of Avignon, close to the Papal Palace in Avignon. An initiative led by Avignon Mayor Henri Duffaut [fr] and Louvre President-Director Michel Laclotte, part of its permanent collection is made of artworks from the Collection Campana [fr] deposited by the Louvre. On 2 April 2024, a new agreement between the City of Avignon and the Louvre allowed its rebranding as Musée du Petit Palais – Louvre en Avignon.[169]
The gypsothèque (plaster cast gallery) of the Louvre is a collection of plaster casts that was formed in 1970 by the reunion of the corresponding inventories of the Louvre, the Beaux-Arts de Paris and the Art and Archaeology Institute of the Sorbonne University, the latter two following depredations during the May 68 student unrest. Initially called the Musée des Monuments Antiques from 1970 to 1978, the project was subsequently left unfinished and only came to fruition after being brought under the Louvre's management by ministerial decision in 2001.[170] It is located in the Petite Écurie, a dependency of Versailles Palace, and has been open to the public since 2012.[171]
The small museum located in Eugène Delacroix's former workshop in central Paris, created in the 1930s, has been placed under management by the Louvre since 2004.[172]
The Louvre-Lens follows a May 2003 initiative by then culture minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon to promote cultural projects outside of Paris that would make the riches of major Parisian institutions available to a broader French public, including a satellite (antenne) of the Louvre.[173] After several rounds of competition, a former mining site in the town of Lens was selected for its location and announced by Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin on 2004-11-29. Japanese architects SANAA and landscape architect Catherine Mosbach were respectively selected in September 2005 to design the museum building and garden. Inaugurated by President François Hollande on 2012-12-04, the Louvre-Lens is run by the Hauts-de-France region under a contract (convention scientifique et culturelle) with the Louvre for art loans and brand use. Its main attraction is an exhibition of roughly 200 artworks from the Louvre on a rotating basis, presented chronologically in a single large room (the Galerie du Temps or ""gallery of time"") that transcends the geographical and object-type divisions along which the Parisian Louvre's displays are organised. The Louvre-Lens has been successful at attracting around 500,000 visitors per year until the COVID-19 pandemic.[174]
The Louvre Abu Dhabi is a separate entity from the Louvre, but the two entities have a multifaceted contractual relationship that allows the Emirati museum to use the Louvre name until 2037, and to exhibit artworks from the Louvre until 2027.[175] It was inaugurated on 2017-11-08 and opened to the public three days later. A 30-year agreement, signed in early 2007 by French Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres and Sheik Sultan bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, establishes that Abu Dhabi shall pay €832,000,000 (US$1.3 billion) in exchange for the Louvre name use, managerial advice, art loans, and special exhibitions.[176] The Louvre Abu Dhabi is located on Saadiyat Island and was designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel and engineering firm of Buro Happold.[177] It occupies 24,000 square metres (260,000 sq ft) and is covered by an iconic metallic dome designed to cast rays of light mimicking sunlight passing through date palm fronds in an oasis. The French art loans, expected to total between 200 and 300 artworks during a 10-year period, come from multiple museums, including the Louvre, the Centre Georges Pompidou, the Musée d'Orsay, Versailles, the Guimet Museum, the Musée Rodin, and the Musée du quai Branly.[178]
The Louvre is involved in controversies that surround cultural property seized under Napoleon I,[179][page needed] as well as during World War II by the Nazis.[180][181] In the early 2010s, workers' rights in the construction of Louvre Abu Dhabi were also a point of controversy for the museum.[182]
Napoleon's campaigns acquired Italian pieces by treaties, as war reparations, and Northern European pieces as spoils, as well as some antiquities excavated in Egypt, though the vast majority of the latter were seized as war reparations by the British army and are now part of collections of the British Museum. On the other hand, the Dendera zodiac is, like the Rosetta Stone, claimed by Egypt even though it was acquired in 1821, before the Egyptian Anti-export legislation of 1835. The Louvre administration has thus argued in favour of retaining this item despite requests by Egypt for its return. The museum participates too in arbitration sessions held via UNESCO's Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to Its Countries of Origin.[183] The museum consequently returned in 2009 five Egyptian fragments of frescoes (30 cm x 15 cm each) whose existence of the tomb of origin had only been brought to the authorities attention in 2008, eight to five years after their good-faith acquisition by the museum from two private collections and after the necessary respect of the procedure of déclassement from French public collections before the Commission scientifique nationale des collections des musées de France.[184]
During Nazi occupation, thousands of artworks were stolen.[185] But after the war, 61,233 articles of more than 150,000 seized artworks returned to France and were assigned to the Office des Biens Privés.[186] In 1949, it entrusted 2,130 unclaimed pieces (including 1,001 paintings) to the Direction des Musées de France in order to keep them under appropriate conditions of conservation until their restitution and meanwhile classified them as MNRs (Musées Nationaux Recuperation or, in English, the National Museums of Recovered Artwork). Some 10% to 35% of the pieces are believed to come from Jewish spoliations[187] and until the identification of their rightful owners, which declined at the end of the 1960s, they are registered indefinitely on separate inventories from the museum's collections.[188]
They were exhibited in 1946 and shown all together to the public during four years (1950–1954) in order to allow rightful claimants to identify their properties, then stored or displayed, according to their interest, in several French museums including the Louvre. From 1951 to 1965, about 37 pieces were restituted. Since November 1996, the partly illustrated catalogue of 1947–1949 has been accessible online and completed. In 1997, Prime Minister Alain Juppé initiated the Mattéoli Commission, headed by Jean Mattéoli, to investigate the matter and according to the government, the Louvre is in charge of 678 pieces of artwork still unclaimed by their rightful owners.[189] During the late 1990s, the comparison of the American war archives, which had not been done before, with the French and German ones as well as two court cases which finally settled some of the heirs' rights (Gentili di Giuseppe and Rosenberg families) allowed more accurate investigations. Since 1996, the restitutions, according sometimes to less formal criteria, concerned 47 more pieces (26 paintings, with 6 from the Louvre including a then displayed Tiepolo), until the last claims of French owners and their heirs ended again in 2006.[citation needed]
According to Serge Klarsfeld, since the now complete and constant publicity which the artworks got in 1996, the majority of the French Jewish community is nevertheless in favour of the return to the normal French civil rule of prescription acquisitive of any unclaimed good after another long period of time and consequently to their ultimate integration into the common French heritage instead of their transfer to foreign institutions like during World War II.[citation needed]
In 2011, over 130 international artists urged a boycott of the new Guggenheim museum as well as Louvre Abu Dhabi, citing reports, since 2009, of abuses of foreign construction workers on Saadiyat Island, including the arbitrary withholding of wages, unsafe working conditions, and failure of companies to pay or reimburse the steep recruitment fees being charged to labourers.[190][191] According to Architectural Record, Abu Dhabi has comprehensive labour laws to protect the workers, but they are not conscientiously implemented or enforced.[192] In 2010, the Guggenheim Foundation placed on its website a joint statement with Abu Dhabi's Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC) recognising the following workers' rights issues, among others: health and safety of the workers; their access to their passports and other documents that the employers have been retaining to guaranty that they stay on the job; using a general contractor that agrees to obey the labour laws; maintaining an independent site monitor; and ending the system that has been generally used in the Persian Gulf region of requiring workers to reimburse recruitment fees.[193]
In 2013, The Observer reported that conditions for the workers at the Louvre and New York University construction sites on Saadiyat amounted to ""modern-day slavery"".[194][195] In 2014, the Guggenheim's Director, Richard Armstrong, said that he believed that living conditions for the workers at the Louvre project were now good and that ""many fewer"" of them were having their passports confiscated. He stated that the main issue then remaining was the recruitment fees charged to workers by agents who recruit them.[196][197] Later in 2014, the Guggenheim's architect, Gehry, commented that working with the Abu Dhabi officials to implement the law to improve the labour conditions at the museum's site is ""a moral responsibility.""[192] He encouraged the TDIC to build additional worker housing and proposed that the contractor cover the cost of the recruitment fees. In 2012, TDIC engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers as an independent monitor required to issue reports every quarter. Labour lawyer Scott Horton told Architectural Record that he hoped the Guggenheim project will influence the treatment of workers on other Saadiyat sites and will ""serve as a model for doing things right.""[192][198]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hogan,Ben Hogan,"
William Ben Hogan (August 13, 1912 – July 25, 1997) was an American professional golfer who is considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of the game.[1] He profoundly influenced golf swing theory, and was noted for his ballstriking skill and assiduous practice. Hogan won nine major championships and is one of six men to complete the modern career grand slam.
Hogan was introduced to golf through caddying at age 11 and turned professional when he was 17. He struggled at the start of his career and did not win a professional tournament until he was 26. After serving in the U.S. Army Air Forces from 1943 to 1945, Hogan claimed his first major championship at the 1946 PGA Championship, which was one of his 13 tournament victories that year. He won the 1948 U.S. Open with a record score of 8-under 276.
In 1949, Hogan was struck in a head-on collision with a bus while driving home from a tournament. He sustained serious injuries, but recovered and returned to professional golf, winning the 1950 U.S. Open in what became known as the ""miracle at Merion"". Hogan achieved the Triple Crown in 1953, with victories at the Masters Tournament, the U.S. Open and the Open Championship. In total, he won 64 professional tournaments recognized as PGA Tour events.
Outside of playing golf, Hogan started his own equipment company and authored Ben Hogan's Five Lessons, which became one of the most influential and best-selling golf books. He was named an inaugural inductee to the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974.
William Ben Hogan[2] was born in Stephenville, Texas, on August 13, 1912. He was the third and youngest child of Clara (née Williams) and Chester Hogan. The family lived in nearby Dublin, Texas, where Chester worked as a blacksmith.[3] Hogan's grandfather and namesake William Hogan was a blacksmith for the 1st Mississippi Cavalry Regiment in the American Civil War.[4][5] The Hogans were of Irish descent.[5] After the war, William worked as a tenant farmer then moved from Mississippi to Dublin, Texas, where Hogan's father Chester was born in 1885.[3] William opened a blacksmith shop in Dublin. Chester worked as a bottler at Dublin Dr Pepper, before inheriting William's blacksmith shop. As a child, Hogan (who went by the name Ben)[6] spent much of his time around the shop, where he was regarded as a shy but polite boy who calmed horses which were in line to be shoed.[3]
As the blacksmith trade declined due to automobiles replacing horses, Chester spiraled into debt; Hogan biographer James Dodson stated Chester ""became so despondent that he could barely lift a hammer"".[3] In 1921, the family sold their house in Dublin and rented a small house in downtown Fort Worth, where Clara worked as a seamstress to support the family and arranged for Chester to be treated by a doctor for his ""black moods"". On February 13, 1922, Chester shot himself with a .38 revolver in the family home in Fort Worth. By some accounts, Hogan was in the same room as his father at that time, although Dodson noted this was uncertain as the Hogan family afterwards refused to discuss the incident and contemporary newspapers gave conflicting reports whether Hogan witnessed his father's suicide or not. He had regarded his father as his hero and he could not bear to see him in a casket during the funeral.[3] The suicide troubled Hogan for the remainder of his life.[7]
The family incurred financial difficulties after Chester's suicide, and the children took jobs to help their mother make ends meet. Hogan's brother Royal quit school aged 14 and delivered office supplies, sold copies of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on street corners. pumped gasoline at a service station, and later took night classes to study accounting. Clara described Royal as her ""rock of Gibraltar"" and said he was crucial to sustaining the family. Nine-year-old Hogan also sold newspaper copies at a nearby train station, and his sister Princess helped by babysitting local children.[3] In a 1983 interview with Ken Venturi, Hogan said he was grateful for his difficult childhood: ""Because I know tough things, and I had a tough day all my life, and I can handle tough things. ... And every day that I progressed was a joy for me, and I recognized that. I don't think I could have done what I've done if I hadn't had the tough days to begin with.""[8][9]
A tip from a friend led Hogan to caddying at age 11 at Glen Garden Country Club in Fort Worth. He walked seven miles each way to the club.[10] Hogan was enticed by hearing caddies could make $0.65 (equivalent to $12 in 2024) per round. Glen Garden had a driving range and the members rarely used it, which meant caddies were free to hit balls while waiting for a bag to carry. Hogan hit more balls than any other caddie. He received pointers from the club professional Ted Longworth on basics such as gripping the club. Outside of this, Hogan was self-taught through watching the swings of the players he caddied for and through trial and error.[11]
Hogan did not show natural ability at golf, but had an intense work ethic and improved rapidly. Caddies at Glen Garden had a game where the shortest hitter would have to retrieve all the balls from the range, which motivated Hogan to become a long hitter despite his slight stature.[11] In his attempt to gain distance, he began hooking the ball, a tendency which plagued him for years afterwards.[12] Hogan's mother Clara initially discouraged him from golf as she did not see a future in it. She unfavorably compared him to his older brother and said Hogan's golf was ""nothing"", adding that ""nothing divided by nothing is nothing"", a phrase which Hogan later used throughout his life. He persisted with golf despite the criticism.[13] Hogan also attempted to play American football but he proved too small, and baseball did not pique his interest. He later said: ""Why golf did I do not know, but I just loved it."" After seeing Walter Hagen arrive in an extravagant car and clothing for the 1927 PGA Championship in Dallas, Hogan decided that ""if golf could make it possible for a fellow to live like that, then I would have a fling at it myself.""[13]
One of Hogan's fellow caddies at Glen Garden was future major champion Byron Nelson, who was six months older than Hogan. The two became friends, but never close friends.[13] At the annual Christmas caddie tournament in 1927, when both were 15, Nelson sank a 30-foot (9.1 m) putt on the final hole to tie the match and force a playoff. Hogan had a putt to win the match on the first extra hole, but he then was informed the format had changed from sudden death to a nine-hole playoff. He ultimately lost the playoff on the final green, after Nelson holed another long putt.[12] Hogan later said that he felt Nelson had received preferential treatment at Glen Garden.[6] When Nelson was chosen to receive junior membership at Glen Garden instead of him the following year, Hogan became determined to surpass Nelson.[13]
Once he turned 16 and reached the age-limit for caddying, Hogan began working in Glen Garden's golf shop, where he repaired and polished clubs. He recalled of this time: ""Boy, I'd look at those clubs and they were the most beautiful things, Nichols and Stewarts, all made in Scotland. I got my own set of mongrel clubs out of a dime store barrel for a dollar a piece.""[13] As he was no longer a caddie and had not received membership, Hogan was not allowed to practice at Glen Garden. He instead practiced at the nearest public course, Katy Lake.[6] In September 1928, Hogan competed in a match play championship held at River Crest Country Club in Fort Worth. He made eagle on the final hole to force extra holes against defending champion M. L. ""Happy"" Massingill, but was eliminated on the 19th hole. Hogan also impressed in the tournament's long-drive contest, leading fellow competitor Ed Stewart to say of the 130-pound (59 kg) Hogan: ""It's a good thing that kid don't weigh about 170.""[12] As a Christmas present in 1928, Clara bought Hogan a set of clubs. She later stated that, upon receiving the clubs, Hogan proclaimed: ""Mama, I'm going to be the greatest golfer that ever lived.""[3]
In 1929, while still in high school, Hogan won the Cleburne Invitational at Cleburne Country Club, where he defeated 52-year-old John Douglas in the final. This was Hogan's first win in a significant tournament.[12][14] In July of that year, he finished second in the Southwest Amateur in Shreveport, Louisiana, losing in the final to Gus Moreland.[12][15] Hogan then won the Dublin-DeLeon tournament in August. He shot a course-record 68 to advance to the final, where he defeated George Meredith. This was Hogan's last amateur victory before turning professional.[12] By this stage, he was prioritizing golf ahead of his formal education. He decided to drop out of Central High School in Fort Worth and attempt to become a professional golfer.[13] Hogan persuaded his mother that he would make up for his lack of a diploma by doubling his efforts to read newspapers and books.[3]
As a 17-year-old, Hogan was hired as an assistant at Oakhurst Country Club, a nine-hole course in downtown Fort Worth.[11] The job paid less than $30 (equivalent to $549 in 2024) per week, but it permitted him to practice whenever customers were not around.[3] Hogan made his professional tournament debut in January 1930 at the Texas Open, a PGA Tour event held at Brackenridge Park Golf Course in San Antonio. He hitched a ride from Fort Worth and paid $5 (equivalent to $94 in 2024) as a registration fee.[3][16] Amidst the Great Depression, Hogan felt that he could not afford to spend time playing amateur tournaments,[3] remarking: ""You can't eat trophies.""[17] He shot rounds of 78-75 and withdrew.[18] He stated afterwards: ""I found out the first day that I shouldn't even be there.""[19] A week later, Hogan competed in the Houston Open, where he shot 77-76 and again withdrew.[13]
Hogan returned to Fort Worth and took on various jobs, such as mopping floors in a restaurant and bellhopping at the Blackstone Hotel. He also worked as a croupier at night at the hotel, a job which he became ashamed of and was reluctant to mention afterwards.[20] Hogan continued his diligent practice. He would practice to the point that his hands bled, and once the skin blistered and cracked open he soaked his hands in pickle brine to toughen them. He made his second attempt to play on tour in late 1931, having received $75 (equivalent to $1,551 in 2024): 25 from his brother, and 50 from businessman Marvin Leonard, whom Hogan had met while caddying at Glen Garden. He joined fellow Texan Ralph Guldahl and headed west.[3]
At the Pasadena Open In December 1931, Hogan failed to finish inside the money as he struggled with a smother hook. Sponsors of the tournament gave competitors a bag of oranges, which he lived off for a week.[21] He earned his first check as a professional in January 1932 at the Los Angeles Open, shooting 71-72-79-69 to receive $50 (equivalent to $1,152 in 2024).[18] He cashed another check at the Agua Caliente Open, shooting 295 over four rounds to earn $200.[22] He also placed in the money at the Phoenix Open, which Guldahl won. Hogan then followed the tour east, but had little success. Paying for his own food, transportation and accommodation while on the road, he soon whittled away his earnings and returned to Texas broke. Hogan then secured a position as club professional at Nolan River Country Club, a small club in Cleburne, Texas.[12] He received $35 (equivalent to $807 in 2024) per week, and rented a room in the back of the club at a nominal price. At Nolan River, Hogan spent a significant amount of his time in the golf shop reshafting clubs from hickory to steel, which gave him a deeper understanding of club construction and mechanics. The club had few members and he rarely was requested to give formal lessons, leaving him ample time to practice and attempt to fix his tendency towards snap hooks.[3][23]
Hogan made two more failed attempts to play on tour in 1933 and 1934. In the latter attempt, he made his first appearance in a major championship, at the 1934 U.S. Open held at Merion Golf Club, where he shot 79-79 to miss the cut.[11] Hogan married Valerie Fox in 1935, and considered quitting the sport as he felt that he was failing to provide for his wife by unsuccessfully pursuing a career as a touring professional. She refused to let him quit and functioned as a form of sports psychologist.[24] He recalled: ""She kept saying, 'You can't give up now. You're so close. I just know it'.""[13] Hogan's mother later stated that ""Valerie is the only one who can honestly say, 'I told you so.' The rest of us hoped Ben would make it, but Valerie was always sure he would.""[25] Hogan qualified for the 1936 U.S. Open at Baltusrol Golf Club,[26] where he again missed the cut, shooting 75-79.[27]
After amassing $1,400 (equivalent to $30,622 in 2024) in savings, Hogan made another attempt to play on tour beginning in 1937. He brought Valerie along with him, as his ""secretary, treasurer, and wardrobe mistress"".[11] By the time he entered the Oakland Open at Sequoyah Country Club in January 1938, they were down to $86.[28] They stayed at the Leamington Hotel in Oakland, and Hogan parked his car across the street to avoid paying the hotel's parking fee. When he exited the hotel on the morning of the first round, he discovered that his car's wheels had been stolen.[29][30] Childhood friend and fellow competitor Byron Nelson gave him a ride to the course. Hogan ultimately finished the tournament in sixth-place, shooting a final-round 67 to earn $285. This enabled him to continue playing on tour.[31]
At the Sacramento Open the following week, Hogan finished third and received $350 (equivalent to $7,818 in 2024). He then received an offer to become assistant professional at Century Country Club in Purchase, New York, a wealthy club which offered him a comfortable salary. Two months later, Hogan made his debut at the 1938 Masters Tournament, where he finished tied-25th. In September of that year, he partnered with Vic Ghezzi to win the Hershey Four-Ball. The pair opened with a best-ball 61, and Hogan made 31 birdies in the 126-hole tournament, six more than anyone else in the field.[3] Despite holding a large lead, he remained determined and emotionless on the final holes. Ghezzi remarked that: ""If we had lost, I am quite certain that [Hogan] would have jumped out of a window."" This was Hogan's first professional victory, and they earned $1,100 (equivalent to $24,572 in 2024).[32] Hogan ended the year at 13th in the PGA Tour's money list, and he later stated this was the turning point of his career.[3]
Hogan had been invited to the Hershey Four-Ball thanks to Henry Picard, who convinced the organizers at Hershey Country Club that the as-yet-winless Hogan was a talented player. Picard also helped Hogan by advising him that weakening his grip might alleviate the tendency to hook the ball. Hogan had received a similar tip to cure the hook in 1937 from Harry Cooper, who noticed that Hogan was letting go of the club slightly at the top of his backswing then regripping it stronger during the downswing than he had done at address.[33] Hogan continued to have success on tour in 1939. He finished runner-up at the Phoenix Open in February, and ninth at the 1939 Masters Tournament in April. Hogan made the cut for the first time at the 1939 U.S. Open, held at Philadelphia Country Club in June, which was won by Nelson. Although he did not win during the year, Hogan recorded 16 top-10 finishes and placed seventh on the money list.[34]
Hogan's significant breakthrough came in 1940. He recorded his first individual win in a professional tournament at the North and South Open in March, held at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina. He shot a record 11-under 277 to finish three shots ahead of runner-up Sam Snead.[35] Hogan followed this with a nine-stroke win at the Greater Greensboro Open the next week. He added his third straight win at the Asheville Land of the Sky Open at the end of March, shooting 67-68-69-69 to win by three strokes. Although he had previously struggled on the greens, Hogan displayed top-class putting during this winning streak.[36] During the trophy presentation at Pinehurst, Hogan said: ""They've kidded me about practicing so much. I'd go out there before a round and practice, and when I was through I'd practice some more. Well, they can kid me all they want because it finally paid off.""[37][38] Hogan added his fourth win of the year at the Goodall Palm Beach Round Robin in May, and ended 1940 as the PGA Tour's money list leader, with over $10,000 (equivalent to $224,442 in 2024) in earnings. He also received the Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring average.[6]
In 1941, Hogan was hired as head professional at Hershey Country Club. He filled the vacancy left by Picard, who recommended that Hogan receive the job. He did not give lessons, and his role was largely ceremonial in that he would represent Hershey while playing tournaments and visit the club to give the members a close-up look at an elite golfer's swing. He received annual payment in the region of $4,000 (equivalent to $85,511 in 2024).[39] Members at Hershey recalled that Hogan had a meticulous attitude towards practice, focusing on each shot on the range as he would during a tournament.[40] During the year, Hogan had eleven runner-up finishes and won five times, including at the Hershey Open. He again topped the tour's money list, with over $18,000 (equivalent to $384,801 in 2024), and won the Vardon Trophy for a second time. Despite this, he stated that he was not yet satisfied with his play.[11]
Hogan started 1942 by winning the Los Angeles Open and the San Francisco Open in January. At the Texas Open in February, he finished runner-up for the third consecutive year. Hogan won his second North and South Open in March, and his third consecutive Asheville Land of the Sky Open at the start of April.[41] The following week, at the 1942 Masters Tournament, Hogan shot 67 on Saturday, the lowest round of the day by four strokes, to move into contention.[42] He shot 2-under 70 in the final round to finish in a tie for first alongside Byron Nelson. In the ensuing 18-hole playoff, Hogan shot 70 but was defeated by one stroke. This extended Hogan's drought in the majors.[43]
Due to World War II, the U.S. Open was cancelled in 1942. In its place, the USGA and the PGA of America organized the Hale America Open in June. Subject to the same open qualifying system as the U.S. Open, it drew over 1,000 attempted qualifiers and the field included many of the top players on tour. It was held at Chicago's Ridgemoor Country Club, which was not a U.S. Open venue.[44] Hogan opened with a 72, then followed with a 10-under 62 to take the lead. He shot 69-68 on the weekend to win by three strokes ahead of Jimmy Demaret and Mike Turnesa. Hogan was presented with the gold medal as traditionally given to a U.S. Open champion by USGA director Joseph Dey. Due to these factors, Hogan's supporters and some golf historians considered this to be a major championship victory for Hogan. Officially, the tournament is not recognized as a major championship.[45][46][47] The event was recognized as a PGA Tour victory, and helped Hogan end the year as the tour's money list leader for the third consecutive year.[3]
Hogan did not play a tournament in 1943. He received his draft notice on March 1, and was inducted into the United States Army Air Forces on March 25. Hogan served in non-combat roles during the war. He was admitted to Officer Candidate School in Miami; he passed and was promoted to second lieutenant later that year. He then returned to Fort Worth and joined the Civilian Pilot Training Program unit, where he received $225 (equivalent to $4,089 in 2024) per month.[48] When aviators returning from overseas arrived in Fort Worth, they were deemed more qualified flight instructors, so Hogan's responsibilities decreased.[49][50] He was afforded time to continue practicing golf and was permitted to play a handful of events when the tour resumed in 1944, including the Chicago Victory Open in June, where he lost in a playoff to Jug McSpaden. He also offered golf instruction to returning pilots who had been wounded in action. Shortly before being honorably discharged on August 5, 1945, Hogan was promoted to the rank of captain.[50] He received a personal letter of gratitude from President Harry S. Truman.[3]
While Hogan was enlisted, Byron Nelson, who was exempt from military service, established himself as the leading player on tour. Nelson won eight tournaments in 1944, and eighteen in 1945, including an unprecedented eleven-straight victories.[51] At the Nashville Invitational in September 1945, Hogan won his first tournament since being drafted, shooting 19-under to win by four ahead of Nelson and Johnny Bulla. Later that month, at the Portland Open Invitational, he won again, finishing 14 strokes clear of runner-up Nelson. Hogan's score of 27-under 261 broke the PGA Tour scoring record in relation to par; this record stood for 53 years, until John Huston shot 28-under at the Hawaiian Open in 1998.[52] Hogan ultimately won five tournaments in his return to the tour in 1945, the last being the Orlando Open in December.[53]
Hogan won four tournaments in the first three months of 1946, including the Texas Open. He entered the 1946 Masters Tournament among the favorites to win, and two of Augusta National's members had bet $50,000 (equivalent to $806,229 in 2024) on Hogan at 4/1 odds. Outsider Herman Keiser led wire-to-wire to claim victory, one stroke ahead of Hogan.[54] The following month, Hogan won the inaugural Colonial National Invitation, held at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth. At the 1946 U.S. Open in June, Hogan had a short-range putt on the final green to enter a playoff, but missed it and finished in tied-fourth. He rebounded with a win at the Inverness Invitational Four-Ball the next week.[55]
Ahead of the 1946 PGA Championship at Portland Golf Club in August, defending champion Byron Nelson announced that he planned to retire from full-time professional golf.[56] Hogan and Nelson were seeded on opposite sides of the draw, so a showdown in the final between the two was possible, but Nelson was eliminated by Porky Oliver.[57] Hogan dispatched Jimmy Demaret, 10 and 9, to reach the final, where he then defeated Oliver, 6 and 4, to win his first major championship. Aged 34, the victory came 17 years after Hogan had turned professional. In total, Hogan played 32 tournaments in 1946. He made the cut in all 32 events and recorded 27 top-10 finishes, including 13 wins. He claimed the title as money list leader for the fourth time in his career, with over $42,000 (equivalent to $677,232 in 2024) in earnings.[55] As Nelson had retired and Sam Snead won only once between December 1946 and March 1949, Hogan established himself as the dominant player on tour.[58]
Partially influenced by Nelson's early retirement, Hogan reduced his tournament schedule in 1947 to avoid potential burnout.[59] He continued his form from 1946 and won four tournaments at the start of the year. Regarding his success, he proclaimed to a sportswriter: ""I've found the secret.""[60] He did not initially reveal the secret, and it became the subject of much speculation. He added three more tournament victories in 1947 after announcing this epiphany.[59] Hogan was chosen as a playing-captain at the 1947 Ryder Cup in November, the first edition of the contest since 1937.[61] The United States trounced Great Britain 11–1.[62] Hogan ended 1947 third in the money list, behind Bobby Locke and leader Jimmy Demaret.[63][64]
Hogan opened 1948 with a win at the Los Angeles Open held at Riviera Country Club. He led wire-to-wire, shooting a record 9-under 275 to win by four strokes ahead of Lloyd Mangrum.[65] Hogan added his second major title at the 1948 PGA Championship, held at Norwood Hills Country Club in May. He defeated Mike Turnesa, 7 and 6, in the final. In this era, the PGA Championship was a grueling 216-hole, seven-day format. After his win, Hogan was exhausted and stated he might not play the PGA Championship again.[65] In June, Hogan competed in the 1948 U.S. Open, which was also held at Riviera Country Club. He opened with a 4-under 67 to take the lead, but was overtaken by Sam Snead in the second round. Hogan rallied with 68-69 on the 36-hole final day to win his first U.S. Open and third major championship title. His total of 276 shattered the U.S. Open scoring record previously held by Ralph Guldahl's 281 in 1937.[66] Hogan's aggregate score of 8-under also set a new U.S. Open record, which stood until Tiger Woods shot 12-under in 2000.[67] With the win, Hogan became the first man to win the PGA Championship and U.S. Open in the same year since Gene Sarazen in 1922.[68]
Following his victory at the U.S. Open, Hogan won five more consecutive tournaments. He was sponsored by equipment company MacGregor Golf at the time, and MacGregor awarded him matching prize money for each of his victories, which averaged $2,090 (equivalent to $27,352 in 2024) during this streak.[66] After the final victory of the streak, at the Denver Open Invitational in August, Hogan signed his scorecard and walked off the course before the trophy presentation. He also refused numerous media requests during this time and the Associated Press issued a report on the incident, which led to negative coverage of Hogan. Biographer Curt Sampson remarked that ""Hogan was extraordinarily driven and had no particular interest in savoring a win in public or in public relations. He was a shy man trying to hide while everyone watched, a sad impossibility.""[69] Hogan added two more wins before the end of the year. In total, he played 25 events in 1948, finishing in the top-three in 17 of them, including 10 wins. He won the inaugural PGA Player of the Year award, and topped the tour's money list for the fifth and final time of his career, with over $30,000 (equivalent to $392,618 in 2024).[69]
In January 1949, Hogan won the Bing Crosby Pro-Am held at Pebble Beach Golf Links. He won again the following week at the Long Beach Open, and finished runner-up at the Phoenix Open at the end of the month. Afterwards, Hogan decided to drive home to Fort Worth in his new Cadillac Sedan.[70]
On the morning of February 2, Hogan and his wife Valerie were driving along a narrow, two-lane bridge near Van Horn, Texas. Hogan had slowed down to under 30 mph (48 km/h) due to fog limiting visibility. At 8:30, a Greyhound Bus 548, whose driver was running late, attempted to overtake a truck by entering the oncoming lane and collided head-on with Hogan's car. The bus weighed approximately 20,000 pounds (9,100 kg) and was traveling at around 50 mph (80 km/h). Moments before the collision, Hogan saw the approaching headlights and let go of the steering wheel to dive in front of Valerie. Hogan would likely have been killed if he had not done so, as the steering column shot through the car upon collision. The edge of the steering wheel nevertheless fractured Hogan's left collarbone, and it was followed by the Cadillac's engine, which snapped his left ankle and crushed his left leg.[71] He also suffered a fractured pelvis, fractured rib, damage to his left eye, and injuries to his internal organs due to the force of the impact. Valerie, who had suffered less severe injuries, managed to exit the car and then remove Hogan from the mangled front seat with the help of two people who had stopped to investigate the scene.[72] The bus had continued onwards until plowing into an embankment several hundred feet past the crash site. None of the passengers in the bus or any other vehicles on the road suffered serious injuries.[3]
A nurse who happened to be on scene recognized that Hogan was descending into circulatory shock after he was removed from the car. He lost and regained consciousness several times before an ambulance arrived around 90 minutes later from El Paso. He was transported to Hôtel-Dieu Hospital in El Paso, where he underwent X-rays before being placed in plaster casts. Valerie was interviewed by reporters who gathered outside the hospital and the detail that Hogan had dove across his wife in an attempt to save her dominated newspapers, with headlines such as ""Hogan's Greatest Win - Saving His Gal Val"". While in hospital, Hogan received thousands of get-well-soon messages from strangers. Hogan's niece Jackie later recalled that: ""Ben really was genuinely startled to discover what he meant to millions of people he'd never met. He simply had no idea how and why they cared about him.""[3] Hogan had previously been regarded as aloof and cold, and the incident caused a sea change in his public image.[73] Regarding the notion that his reason for diving in front of Valerie was to save her, Hogan later said: ""That was a bunch of bullshit. I was trying to get out of the way of the bus.""[74][75]
Hogan's condition quickly improved from ""critical"" to ""fair"" to ""good"", and he was informed that he would soon be able to leave the hospital. However, on February 18, Hogan reported a sharp pain in his chest and it was determined that blood clots were traveling from his damaged left leg towards his lungs, creating the threat of a pulmonary embolism.[76] Attempts to thin Hogan's blood proved ineffective so the decision was made to have an emergency operation. Alton Ochsner, regarded as the top vascular surgeon in the country, accepted the request to perform the surgery, but was unable to fly from New Orleans to El Paso due to a rainstorm. U.S. Air Force brigadier general David William Hutchison agreed to a plea from Hogan's family to send a B-29 to transport Ochsner.[77] The surgery lasted around two hours and Ochsner successfully ligated Hogan's inferior vena cava.[78] Hogan left the hospital at the start of April and returned home by train to Fort Worth.[79] During his hospital stay, Hogan was asked by journalist Charles Bartlett if he would return to golf: ""I'm going to try. ... You work for perfection all your life, and then something like this happens. My nervous system has been all shot by this, and I don't see how I can readjust it to competitive golf. But you can bet I'll be back there swinging.""[80]
As a result of his broken collarbone, Hogan experienced regular pain in his left shoulder for the remainder of his life. Blood flow to his legs was also permanently restricted, which caused discomfort and pain. His doctors were skeptical that he would ever walk independently again, let alone play golf. They advised that it would take around five months before the swelling in his legs subsided and informed him that his muscles had atrophied. By April 17, Hogan walked a half-block around Westover Hills with the aid of a cane and assistance from a nurse. After a promising evaluation from Ochsner on April 30, Hogan doubled his recovery efforts. He mailed an entry form for the 1949 U.S. Open in June, but was unable to participate. While the U.S. Open was ongoing, the driver of the Greyhound bus which collided with Hogan was on trial for aggravated assault and failure to yield the right-of-way. He was found responsible but received the minimum penalty: a fine and legal costs which totaled only $127 (equivalent to $1,678 in 2024). Separately, Hogan reached an undisclosed financial settlement with Greyhound. It was reported that he received $25,000 (equivalent to $330,385 in 2024) a year for life in compensation.[3][11] Later in 1949, the driver of the Greyhound bus was involved in another crash, which resulted in two deaths and 34 injuries.[80]
By September 1949, Hogan had recovered enough to travel aboard the RMS Queen Elizabeth to England, where he was selected as non-playing captain for the United States at the 1949 Ryder Cup held at Ganton Golf Club. More than a ceremonial captain, Hogan demanded his players to wake earlier than usual and practice before and after each match. The American team rallied on the final day to win by a score of 7–5.[81] Upon his return to Fort Worth, Hogan began hitting full shots on the practice range. He experienced significant pain when shifting weight during the swing, but this lessened over time. He played eighteen holes for the first time since the crash on December 10, at Colonial Country Club with the aid of a scooter, which he reluctantly rode on in between shots. Two weeks later, he registered to make his return to the tour and play the Los Angeles Open.[82]
Hogan played in his first tournament since the car crash in January 1950, at the Los Angeles Open held at Riviera Country Club.[83] He opened with a 73, then followed with three consecutive rounds of 69 to post 4-under 280. Sam Snead birdied the 17th and 18th holes to match Hogan's score and force a playoff. A member of Riviera recalled that, during the fourth round, Hogan ""was telling me his arms felt like wet noodles and he was in some kind of pain on every step.""[84] In the playoff, Hogan shot a 5-over 76 and was defeated by Snead, who shot 72.[83] Sportswriter Grantland Rice wrote: ""[Hogan's] legs simply were not strong enough to carry his heart any longer.""[85] Two weeks later, he played in the Phoenix Open, which was ceremonially named the ""Ben Hogan Open"". He shot 65 in the first round, but faltered with three over-par rounds and finished tied-20th.[86] Hogan did not play again until the 1950 Masters Tournament in April, where he finished in a tie for fourth.[80] He recorded his first victory of the season at the Greenbrier Pro-Am in May, shooting 64-64-65-66 to total 21-under 259 and win by 10 strokes ahead of Snead.[87][88]
Despite his successful return to tournament play, Hogan struggled with near-blindness in his left eye which had been damaged in the crash, a condition which he refused to mention to the press. He also experienced constant pain while on the course.[89] As a result, Hogan dramatically reduced his tournament schedule. Previously he had averaged around 30 tournaments per year, but now he could only play five or so. To compensate for the lack of tournament play, Hogan underwent pre-round preparations that lasted four hours. In the mornings, he soaked in hot water and Epsom salt. He followed this by consuming large amounts of aspirin, wrapped his legs in bandages to prevent swelling, had breakfast, then started his lengthy practice routine.[90]
At the 1950 U.S. Open held at Merion Golf Club, Hogan opened with a 2-over 72 on Thursday. His legs began to cramp on the back nine on Friday, but he played through severe pain and carded a 69 to trail the lead by two shots heading into the 36-hole final day. As he had a 9:30 tee time the next morning, Hogan woke at 5 a.m. to undergo his pre-round preparations.[91] In the morning round, he shot a 72 and remained two strokes off the lead, which was held by the 1946 U.S. Open champion Lloyd Mangrum. In the afternoon round, Hogan's 37 on the front nine was enough claim the lead, as his competitors all struggled. With nine holes remaining, most of the 13,000 spectators on the course were following Hogan.[92] After climbing the hill to the 12th tee and hitting his drive, Hogan visibly staggered and almost fell. He ultimately made bogey on the hole, and later recalled: ""My legs had turned to stone.""[11] Hogan retained a two-shot lead on the 15th hole, but three-putted for bogey. He dropped another shot on the 230-yard (210 m) par-3 17th after finding the greenside bunker, meaning he required a par on the uphill, 458-yard (419 m) par-4 18th hole to force a playoff.[93] After finding the fairway, Hogan still had 213 yards (195 m) remaining for his approach. He hit a 17-degree 1-iron to 40 feet (12 m) and two-putted for par to join the playoff alongside Mangrum and George Fazio.[94][95] Hy Peskin of Sports Illustrated photographed Hogan playing his 1-iron approach to the green at the 72nd hole. It subsequently became one of the most famed images in golf history.[96][97]
The 18-hole playoff was set for the following day. Hogan returned to the Barclay Hotel in Philadelphia and was rejuvenated by a good night's sleep.[98] He fell behind early in the playoff after Mangrum birdied the 2nd hole, but thereafter never trailed.[98] Hogan holed a 50-foot (15 m) putt for birdie on the 17th hole to establish a four-shot lead headed to the 18th hole, where he hit a 5-iron into the green and made par to win his second U.S. Open title.[93][99] Just 16 months after his near-fatal car crash, Hogan had won what was generally considered the most important tournament in the golfing calendar at that time. It was immediately credited as one of the most impressive comeback achievements in sports history.[100] Hogan's victory at the 1950 U.S. Open subsequently became known as the ""miracle at Merion"".[101][102]
Hogan made his first start of 1951 at the Phoenix Open in January. He shot an opening round of 6-under 65 to take the lead, but was forced to withdraw due to intestinal influenza.[103][104] Hogan did not return until April, at the 1951 Masters Tournament. After rounds of 70-72-70, Hogan was positioned in third place, one shot off the lead shared by Skee Riegel and Sam Snead.[105] Hogan went out in 33, and built a two-shot lead after making birdie on the par-5 13th hole. He maintained this advantage headed to the 18th hole, where he holed a 4-foot (1.2 m) putt for par to shoot a bogey-free 68 and win his first Masters title. He was presented with the green jacket by Bobby Jones. When a reporter asked him which tournament he would like to win next, Hogan said: ""If I never win another one, I'll be satisfied.""[106]
In his title defense at the 1951 U.S. Open held at Oakland Hills Country Club, Hogan started with a 6-over 76. Oakland Hills' South Course was a Donald Ross design but had been renovated by Robert Trent Jones prior to the U.S. Open to tighten the fairways and add more fairway bunkers; the course was subsequently dubbed ""the Monster"" by the media.[107] Hogan said after his 76 that it was ""the most stupid round of golf I ever played."" He followed with a 73 and stood five strokes behind the lead. A third-round 71 on Saturday morning left Hogan in fifth-place at 10-over-par.[108] In the final round on Saturday afternoon, Hogan decided to attack the course and almost holed multiple approach shots. He finished with a 15-foot (4.6 m) putt for birdie on the 459-yard (420 m) par-4 18th to shoot 67, the lowest round of the week, and retain his U.S. Open title.[109] Afterwards, Hogan described it as ""the finest round of golf I have ever played"" and said ""I'm glad I brought this course, this monster, to its knees.""[110]
Hogan played in only three tournaments in 1952.[111] As the defending champion at the 1952 Masters Tournament in April, he was tied for the lead after 54 holes alongside Snead, but shot a 7-over 79 and finished in tied-7th. As part of the 79, he three-putted on five occasions.[112] During that year, Hogan started the tradition of the Masters champions' dinner, after suggesting the idea to Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts. He recalled: ""They thought it would be a great idea, especially since I was the defending champion and would pick up the check.""[112] He won the Colonial National Invitation in May,[111] and held the 36-hole lead at the 1952 U.S. Open in June, but shot 74-74 over the final two rounds to finish in third place.[113]
On the eve of the 1953 Masters Tournament in April, 40-year-old Hogan stated to a reporter: ""I'm in grand shape. I practiced every day of the winter.""[114] He opened with a 2-under 70 in the first round, and followed with a 69 to take a one-shot lead at 5-under.[115] Hogan extended his lead to four strokes thanks to a third-round 66, which also set the 54-hole scoring record at the tournament at 11-under 205. He closed out the tournament with a 69 on Sunday to claim the second Masters title of his career. His total of 14-under 274 broke the previous tournament record by five strokes. Hogan said afterwards: ""That's as good as I can play.""[116] President Dwight D. Eisenhower flew to Augusta and two days later played the course together with Hogan, Byron Nelson, and Clifford Roberts. Eisenhower joked that: ""Ben Hogan made fun of your course, didn't he, Cliff?""[117]
In May, Hogan competed in the Pan American Open, for which he received an appearance fee of $5,000 (equivalent to $58,762 in 2024). He won the tournament by three strokes.[118][119] Later that month, Hogan won the Colonial National Invitation for the fourth time in his career. He shot a final-round 67 to win by five strokes. Sportswriters quipped that the tournament should be renamed the ""Colonial National Second Place Invitation"" due to the difficulty other players had in defeating Hogan at the event.[120]
Although he had won three of the previous five U.S. Opens, Hogan had to participate in 36-hole qualifying for the 1953 U.S. Open held at Oakmont Country Club in June due to the USGA's rules at the time. Biographer Curt Sampson stated that making Hogan play a qualifier for the U.S. Open was ""like running a credit check on John D. Rockefeller, an insult and a waste of time.""[121] After qualifying, Hogan shot a bogey-free 67 to take the first-round lead.[122] He retained his lead following rounds of 72-73, but his long-time rival Sam Snead had closed within one stroke.[123] In the final round, Hogan drove the green on the 292-yard (267 m) par-4 17th hole to set up a birdie, then hit a 5-iron approach close to the pin on the 18th and rolled in the birdie putt to shoot 71. Hogan's total of 5-under 283 was six strokes clear of the runner-up Snead.[124] With the victory, Hogan joined Willie Anderson and Bobby Jones as the only men to have won four U.S. Opens. Jack Nicklaus equaled this mark in 1980.[118]
Towards the end of June, Hogan traveled across the Atlantic to compete in the 1953 Open Championship, held at Carnoustie Golf Links in Scotland.[125] He arrived two weeks early in Scotland to practice on links courses and familiarize himself with the British-sized golf ball, which had a 1.62 in (41 mm) diameter compared to the American 1.68 in (43 mm) ball.[126] He practiced at Panmure Golf Club, which afforded him more privacy than Carnoustie.[127] In this era, the Open offered a prize pool that was a fraction of the American major championships. When asked why he chose to compete in the Open, Hogan said fellow major champions such as Tommy Armour and Walter Hagen had urged him to play.[126] The 1953 PGA Championship was scheduled in the same week as the 1953 Open Championship, meaning it was impossible to compete in both.[118]
Hogan initially was not fond of Carnoustie. He stated: ""These greens are awful. It's like putting on glue. I've got a lawnmower back in Texas. I'll send it over to you."" The Open Championship rules at the time also meant that Hogan had to participate in qualifying on July 6–7 despite his status as the reigning Masters and U.S. Open champion.[127] He stated afterwards: ""I kept asking myself, 'What am I doing over here?'"" He felt pressure to perform and believed if he did not win, ""people over there would have thought, 'Well, American players aren't so good as they're supposed to be, especially under British conditions'.""[128] Hogan made it through qualifying and shot a 1-over 73 in the first round. He struggled on the greens on the opening day and the struggles continued in the second round, but he shot 71 thanks to quality ballstriking and moved within two strokes of the lead.[129] Hogan developed a flu prior to the 36-hole final day; he had a temperature of 103 °F (39 °C), but received a shot of penicillin and continued to play. He shot 70 in the third round to tie for the lead alongside Roberto De Vicenzo.[130]
In the final round at Carnoustie, Hogan chipped in from 40 feet (12 m) for birdie on the 5th hole, then made another birdie at the par-5 6th.[131] Hogan was notified he had a two-stroke lead while on the 15th hole, and after hitting his approach to 12 feet (3.7 m) on the 235-yard (215 m) par-3 16th, he told reporter John Derr: ""This tournament's over. You can go in now and set up for the broadcast.""[131] Hogan finished with a birdie on the 18th hole to shoot a course-record 68 and claim the Claret Jug, totaling 6-under 282 to win by four strokes over Antonio Cerdá, Dai Rees, Frank Stranahan, and Peter Thomson.[132] This made him the second golfer after Gene Sarazen to complete the modern career grand slam, and the first to win the Triple Crown. As well as the ""Triple Crown"", the press dubbed it the ""Hogan Slam"" and compared it to Bobby Jones's 1930 season.[118][133] For this win, Hogan received £500 (equivalent to $17,634 in 2023).[134]
When asked afterwards if he would return to the Open Championship, Hogan said: ""I don't know when I'll be back. But I'll try to make it next year."" He never played again in the Open, and the win at Carnoustie was his ninth and final major championship.[135] Hogan returned to America on July 21, aboard the SS United States.[132] When he arrived in New York City, he received a ticker-tape parade down Broadway. He stated: ""Only in America could such a thing as this happen to a little guy like me. Ever since I can remember, new things and better things have been happening to me. I owe it all to the people who have been pulling for me—and to the good Lord.""[136][137] Hogan was the first golfer to have been honored in this way since Bobby Jones in 1930.[133] For his achievements, Hogan was named the 1953 AP Athlete of the Year and was awarded the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete in the United States.[138]
As the defending champion at the 1954 Masters Tournament, Hogan held a three-stroke lead after 54 holes, but shot a 75 in the final round to fall into a tie for the lead with Sam Snead. In the ensuing 18-hole playoff, Hogan lost with a score of 71 to Snead's 70. This was one of Hogan's many close calls in major championships in his later years. He missed multiple short putts in the final round of the 1955 Masters Tournament, where he again finished runner-up, this time to Cary Middlecoff. With his persistent struggles on the green, he found it difficult to contend over the course of four rounds at Augusta National for the rest of his career.[139] Hogan missed the cut for the first time at the 1957 Masters Tournament.[140] This ended his streak of 14 consecutive top-10 finishes at Augusta National.[141]
Despite his putting struggles, Hogan continued to contend in U.S. Opens.[139] At the 1955 U.S. Open, Hogan had the outright lead through three rounds. After two putting for par on the final hole to post 287, he was congratulated by Gene Sarazen, who was commentating the event for NBC-TV.[142] NBC then finished its coverage by declaring Hogan the champion. Meanwhile, Jack Fleck was still on the course, and birdied his final hole to match Hogan's score of 287 and force a playoff.[143] In the playoff, Hogan trailed by one headed to the 18th hole. He hooked his drive left and took multiple strokes to remove the ball from deep rough, which resulted in a double-bogey. Fleck made par to win with 69 to Hogan's 72. Hogan announced afterwards: ""I'm through with competitive golf. From now on, I'm a weekend golfer.""[144] He contended again at the 1956 U.S. Open. He missed a putt on the 71st hole from approximately 3 feet (0.91 m) and ultimately finished one stroke behind the winning mark of 282.[145] Hogan competed in the 1956 Canada Cup the following week, where he partnered with Snead to represent the United States. They won by 14 strokes over the South African team of Bobby Locke and Gary Player. Hogan also led the individual leaderboard with a score of 7-under 277, five strokes clear of second.[146]
Hogan won the final professional tournament of his career at the Colonial National Invitation in May 1959. After missing a 3-foot (0.91 m) putt to win in regulation, he entered an 18-hole playoff with Fred Hawkins. Regarding the miss, he said: ""I was completely confident I could sink that putt. I guess I didn't hit enough club."" In windy conditions, Hogan shot 1-under 69 in the playoff to best Hawkins' 73 and claim the fifth victory of his career at Colonial. He stated afterwards: ""It's been quite a dry spell. I've had five years of poor putting.""[12] The following month, Hogan was in solo-second place after three rounds at the 1959 U.S. Open but shot a 76 to finish five strokes behind the winner Billy Casper.[147]
After three rounds at the 1960 Masters Tournament, Hogan was one stroke behind the lead held by Arnold Palmer, but carded a final-round 76 to finish seven behind Palmer. Two months later, Hogan was in contention at the 1960 U.S. Open. After opening with a 4-over 75, Hogan rebounded with a 67. Paired with 20-year-old Jack Nicklaus in the third round, Hogan shot a 69, as did Nicklaus.[148] In the final round, Hogan was tied for the lead on the par-5 17th and had around 50 yards (46 m) for his approach.[149] He went directly at the pin for his third shot, but hit it too short and his ball found the stream guarding the green. Hogan was able to play his fourth shot onto the green, but missed the par putt and dropped out of the lead.[150] In an attempt to reclaim the lost stroke, Hogan hit an aggressive drive on the long, par-4 18th hole, but hooked it into the water and made a 7.[151] With his bogey, triple-bogey finish, he fell into a tie for ninth, four strokes behind the champion Palmer.[152] In 1983, Hogan commented on his approach to the 17th green: ""I find myself waking up at night thinking of that shot. ... That was 23 years ago and there isn't a month that goes by that that doesn't cut my guts out.""[153]
At the 1967 Masters Tournament, 54-year-old Hogan opened with 74-73 to make the cut but was seven strokes adrift of the lead. On Saturday, he shot the low round of the tournament with a 6-under 66, including a 30 on the back nine, to move within two of the lead.[154] He faltered with a final-round 77 and finished tied-10th. He limped badly during the tournament and it proved to be Hogan's final appearance at the Masters, although he did not announce it beforehand.[155] Hogan detested being seen as a ceremonial golfer and after 1967 did not attend the Masters champions' dinner.[156]
In 1971, Hogan entered the Houston Champions International held at Champions Golf Club. He played at the request of his friends Jack Burke Jr. and Jimmy Demaret, who had founded the Champions Golf Club. In the opening round, Hogan hit his approach into a creek left of the green on the par-3 4th hole. When he went down to retrieve the ball, he injured his knee which had been damaged in the 1949 car crash. He continued to play through the pain until the 12th hole, at which point he returned to the clubhouse and withdrew from the event. Aged 58, this was Hogan's last professional tournament.[157] As he left the course, he told a friend in the gallery: ""Don't ever get old.""[158]
Hogan met his wife Valerie Fox in Sunday school in Fort Worth when they were both aged around 12.[23] They married on April 14, 1935, with a handful of friends and family in attendance at the home of Valerie's parents. The wedding was officiated by Albert Venting, pastor of the First Baptist Church in Cleburne.[27] The couple never had children.[62][159] Hogan regularly attended services by Reverend Granville Walker at University Christian Church in Fort Worth. He also attended services at the Catholic church where his niece and her husband were parishioners.[3]
Outside of golf, Hogan became wealthy through oil exploration. He was advised by Fort Worth oilman Gary Laughlin.[160] An oil broker who negotiated with Hogan recalled: ""He studied drilling histories and geology reports and had everything down to the smallest detail. You really had to be on your toes with Ben.""[3] Hogan was a political conservative. He said in 1970: ""The trouble in this country started when I was young, when the vote was extended to people who had no property.""[161]
Throughout his career, Hogan was considered introverted and shy by the media and his competitors.[6][162] Sam Snead stated: ""About all Ben ever said on a golf course was 'good luck' on the tee and 'you're away'.""[163] Hogan was compared to Greta Garbo due to his shunning of publicity.[164] In his private life, Hogan was more open and affectionate. He played practical jokes on his friends and used an alterego, ""Henny Bogan"".[3] He also mentored younger golfers who had asked him for help, such as Gardner Dickinson and John Schlee.[62] Prior to his golf career, Dickinson had earned a degree in clinical psychology. He administered a psychometric evaluation of Hogan and said the results showed Hogan had ""an IQ of 170 to 172"".[165][166]
Hogan was close friends with Marvin Leonard, a department store owner whom he had met while caddying at Glen Garden as a child.[167] Leonard founded Colonial Country Club in 1936. He also built Shady Oaks Country Club in 1958, of which Hogan was a founding member. Leonard loaned Hogan money early in his golf career and later declined Hogan's attempt to pay the money back. Hogan gave a book to Leonard with the inscription: ""To Marvin Leonard, the best friend I will ever have. If my father had lived, I would have wanted him to be just like you.""[12][168]
After retiring from professional golf, Hogan spent much of his time at Shady Oaks, where he continued to practice. In the clubhouse, he generally sat alone at a table overlooking the 9th and 18th greens.[169] Hogan was fond of animals, particularly dogs, and donated to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.[170][171] He and Valerie had a poodle named Duffer; following its death, Hogan swore not to have another dog as he did not want to experience the pain of grief again.[3] At Shady Oaks, he befriended two dogs, Buster and Max, which the club had adopted. Members at Shady Oaks recalled that Hogan cried at Buster's grave after the dog died in 1993.[172]
Hogan began smoking cigarettes around the same time he began caddying, and continued the habit into his 80s. He averaged around two packs per day.[6] Hogan appeared in an advertisement for Chesterfield in 1953.[173] After surgery for a ruptured appendix in 1987 led to him developing pneumonia, Hogan's doctors strongly advised him to stop smoking, but he continued to do so.[174]
In his final years, Hogan suffered from blindness and Alzheimer's disease.[175][176] During an event at Colonial Country Club in 1992 with Ben Crenshaw, Hogan toured the Hogan Room where his trophies and medals were displayed. He did not recognize them and asked Crenshaw: ""Are all of these mine?"" When Crenshaw confirmed they were, Hogan said: ""I really must have been something.""[6] As Hogan's mental condition worsened, Valerie forbade visitors from seeing him.[3] In 1995, Hogan had surgery due to colon cancer. He developed bronchitis after the surgery.[177]
Hogan died on July 25, 1997,[178][179][180] after suffering a stroke at his home in Fort Worth. He was 84.[181] Pallbearers at the funeral included golfers Tommy Bolt, Sam Snead, and Ken Venturi, as well as sportswriters Dan Jenkins and Jim Murray.[181] Hogan's wife Valerie died two years later on June 30, 1999;[182] they were interred at Greenwood Memorial Park in Fort Worth.[183]
Hogan was known to practice more than any of his contemporary golfers and is credited as having ""invented practice"".[184][185] Around the time Hogan began his career, players generally did not have structured practice sessions. Biographer Curt Sampson stated: ""The old-timers in golf rarely practiced. They'd take a few swings and then go out and play in a tournament.""[186] Hogan believed that there is ""not enough daylight in a day to practice all the shots you ought to be practicing.""[187] In an interview following his win at the 1953 Masters, Hogan said: ""Practice means as much as playing itself. A tournament is an anticlimax to preparation, the way I see it.""[116]
When asked in 1983 why he practiced more than his contemporaries, Hogan recalled: ""My swing wasn't the best in the world, and I knew it wasn't. And I thought, 'Well, the only way I can win is just to outwork these fellas'.""[188] He added: ""You hear stories about me beating my brains out practicing, but... I was enjoying myself. I couldn't wait to get up in the morning, so I could hit balls. When I'm hitting the ball where I want, hard and crisply, it's a joy that very few people experience.""[189] Hogan often stated that the secret to improving at golf was ""in the dirt"", meaning the dirt of the practice range.[190][191]
At 5 ft 8.5 in (1.74 m) and 145 pounds (66 kg), Hogan was slight of build.[192] This earned him the nickname ""Bantam Ben"", which he disliked.[193] In his autobiography, Byron Nelson wrote of Hogan: ""Though he was short, he had big hands and arms for his size.""[194][195] Hogan never wore gloves;[196] fellow Masters champion Jimmy Demaret said shaking hands with Hogan felt like ""putting your hand in a meat grinder"" due to his extensive calluses.[82] After meeting Hogan for the first time in 1951, baseball player Ted Williams stated: ""I just shook a hand that felt like five bands of steel.""[197]
Despite his modest stature, Hogan was among the longer hitters on tour in his era. Hogan had exceptional athleticism and a fast swing, which enabled him to keep pace with his physically larger rivals such as Nelson and Sam Snead.[188] Hogan believed that driving was the most important part of the golf game.[161] Golf instructor Jim McLean stated that, during a visit to the equipment company Spalding, Hogan had recorded the fastest clubhead speed among all professionals at that time.[198] Hogan had a significant lateral slide of his hips at the start of his downswing, which allowed him to create a lot of lag. Professional golfer Bob Toski said Hogan had the ""fastest and most complete clearance of his hips toward the target, and he kept right-arm extension past impact longer than anyone.""[188] Hogan was double-jointed, which helped him to execute his swing. Gary Player said: ""I tried to copy Hogan for a long time, but I finally had to give up. It was wrecking my game. The man was a gymnast.""[188]
Early in his career, Hogan primarily used a right-to-left ball flight. This at times manifested as a snap hook, particularly under pressure.[127][199][200]  Demaret said Hogan's change in 1942 from a slight hook to a soft fade led him to becoming a great golfer.[201] Hogan's efforts to fix the hook were perfected in 1946 and he stated he had discovered the ""secret"" that year.[188] The result was the ""Hogan fade"", a relatively low-trajectory shot which curved only a few yards left-to-right.[198] The shot involved a weakening of his left-hand grip and rotating the clubface open on the backswing, thus creating a cupped wrist. These measures allowed him to release the club as hard as he wanted without fear of the clubface shutting and producing a hook. Gardner Dickinson said of Hogan's changes: ""In this final, brilliant product, Hogan had taken his biggest enemy, the huge forward slide, and turned it into his biggest asset.""[188] Butch Harmon said in 2009: ""Until Tiger came along, I'd never seen a good player with body speed as fast as Mr. Hogan's. That's why he ruined so many emulators. As open as he got the club on the downswing, he needed tremendous speed to get it back to square.""[188]
Hogan had a negative angle of attack, meaning he hit down on the ball slightly with the driver. To prevent the balata balls used at the time ballooning up as a result of the negative attack angle, Hogan covered the ball through impact. His ability to compress the ball meant he was one of the few players of his era who did not lose distance by hitting a fade. According to instructors polled by Golf Digest, Hogan created his fade through his club path, which was left of the target. He combined this with a square club face at impact, as a leftward path and an open face would have caused a slice rather than a tight fade. Sean Foley, formerly a coach of Tiger Woods, dissented to this opinion and stated that Hogan had a neutral path and clubface. Foley believed instead that Hogan intentionally hit towards the heel of the club, thus utilizing the gear effect to produce a fade. As radar monitors such as TrackMan did not exist during Hogan's time, the specifics of how he created his power fade are unknown in quantifiable terms and can only be surmised.[198] Alongside the fade, Hogan continued to hit draws if required by the pin location.[127]
Due to the injuries he suffered in the 1949 accident, Hogan was forced to change his swing. The damage to his knees and pelvis caused him to reduce his hip turn through the ball, which lowered his driving distance by around 12 yards. He compensated for this by narrowing his stance, thus attaining more control and repeatability.[188] Mike Bell, a member of the Ben Hogan Foundation, said: ""When you look at photographs of Hogan's golf swing in '46, '47 and '48, he'd clearly figured it out. The golf swing after the wreck is different. It was much more compact, much shorter. Still extremely precise. It was like he reinvented his golf swing to fit what his body could do."" Brendan Quinn of The Athletic remarked in 2020 that ""you could make the case that Ben Hogan built the greatest golf swing the game has ever seen. Twice.""[80]
Hogan stressed the importance of course management. At the 1938 St. Petersburg Open, Hogan hit two flagsticks in the same round, causing his ball to ricochet far away from the hole. He realized that aiming directly at the pin was hurting his game and decided afterwards to aim for flat portions of the green near the hole, preferably leaving himself uphill putts for birdie.[3] In preparation for tournaments, Hogan walked the course backwards (from green to fairway, from fairway to tee) in order to determine the optimal way to play the course.[202][203] Hogan removed his 7-iron from the bag in favor of a 1-iron at the 1950 U.S. Open at Merion Golf Club, proclaiming: ""There are no seven-iron shots at Merion.""[11]
After winning the 1953 Masters, Hogan said: ""You can hit your shots great and still shoot 80 every day because of poor management. The shots are 30 percent of the game. Judgment is 70 percent.""[204] Sportswriter Arthur Daley stated that during practice rounds at the 1953 U.S. Open, Hogan hit three balls on each tee then played in from there to assess the hole from different angles.[118] Hogan remarked that ""the most important shot in golf is the next one.""[205] During the 1953 Open Championship, he was dubbed the ""Wee Ice Mon"" (or ""Wee Iceman"") by the Scottish fans in reference to his emotionless demeanor on the course, as though he had ice in his veins.[206][207]
Hogan was nicknamed the ""Hawk"" due to how he analyzed his opponents,[6] and because of the way he studied courses.[208] He stated in 1975 that the ""greatest thing in golf is to be able to save shots"". He said the key to accomplishing this was distance control, adding: ""It's just as bad to hit a ball too far or too short as it is to hook or slice.""[209] Hogan's former caddie Chuck Pollock recalled in 1991 that Hogan rarely talked to him on the course: ""He was very prepared and didn't need much from me except to check for pin placements. ... He was like a computer out there. Every shot had been planned before the round, and he knew exactly when to go after birdies.""[210]
Hogan struggled with putting for much of his career.[36] After complaining to his wife in 1937 about not making enough putts, she  suggested: ""Just hit the ball a little closer to the hole.""[211][212] Following the accident in 1949, Hogan asked Jack Burke Jr., who was considered among the top putters on tour, for help with his putting. Burke recalled in 2009: ""I think he knew he wasn't going to be as good tee to green, not as long and not as good with the irons. Before that, Hogan didn't really know a lot about putting, never was really serious about it. But we worked on it, mainly got his left hand under the shaft, which helps close the toe on the forward stroke, and he got better. He putted pretty well for three years.""[188] As his putting struggles worsened, Hogan tested various types of putters and putting grips.[213] In preparation for the 1957 Masters Tournament, Hogan tried a 10-finger, baseball grip while putting. Although his putting improved, he was too embarrassed to use the grip in front of the crowds at Augusta National and reverted to the conventional, reverse-overlap grip which he had used throughout his career. He subsequently missed the cut at the Masters for the first time in his career.[140]
Following the 1957 Masters, Hogan proposed eliminating putting from golf: ""I've always contended that golf is one game, and putting is another. If I had my way, every golf green would be made into a huge funnel; you hit the funnel, and the ball would roll down a pipe into the hole.""[214] Hogan's contemporary Fred Haas said Hogan had told him: ""I don't want to be remembered as a great putter. I want to be remembered as a great striker of the ball.""[213] In his later career, Hogan was afflicted by the yips. He stated in 1974: ""I got to where I couldn't get the putter back. I could get it through if I could ever get it back, but I couldn't get it back. I would just stand there and shake, and it wouldn't move.""[215] In response to a question about how he mastered ballstriking but not putting, Hogan said the ball is ""subject to too many undulations and grass changes and things like that"" while on the ground compared to when it is in air.[214]
In his 1948 book Power Golf, Hogan wrote: ""Many golf fans are surprised to learn that I learned to play golf left-handed when I first took up the game. I changed over when I was a small boy. The only clubs I could get were right-handed. Moreover, most of the fellows I played with then were very convincing in telling me that left-handers never made good golfers. At that age I was gullible enough to believe them and to make the change.""[216] When asked if he was left-handed in a 1987 interview, he said: ""No, that's one of those things that's always been written, but it's an absolute myth.""[217] Biographer Curt Sampson said Hogan intentionally obfuscated details about himself, and said Hogan's ""explanations were often meant to mystify.""[216]
In 1954, Hogan accepted an offer of $10,000 (equivalent to $117,088 in 2024) from Life magazine to reveal the ""secret"" to his swing which he stated he had discovered in 1946.[218] Hogan had previously explained some golf swing theories in his 1948 instructional Power Golf.[219] The story in Life, tilted ""Ben Hogan Finally Reveals the Mysterious Maneuver That Made Him a Champion"", was issued on August 8, 1955. In it, he said the secret had three components: weakening his grip (in other words, moving it to his left), opening the clubface on the backswing, and cupping the left wrist. This method was designed to prevent him from hooking the ball, which made the ""secret"" ineffectual for most recreational golfers who generally struggled with slices rather than hooks.[220] In the Life piece, Hogan stated: ""I doubt if it will be worth a doggone to the weekend duffer and it will ruin a bad golfer. With the club so wide open at the top of the backswing, anybody who fails to close it properly on the way down will push the ball off to the right—or worse yet, shank it off to the right at a horrible right angle. But it will be a blessing to the good golfer.""[221]
Hogan's fellow professionals believed he had not revealed much to Life and retained the real secret for himself.[220] As debate about the secret continued, Sports Illustrated published drawings on the subject, which it took from Hogan's piece in Life without his permission. After Hogan threatened to sue, Life and Sports Illustrated founder Henry Luce offered him an additional $20,000 (equivalent to $234,758 in 2024) to write a full-length instructional, which Hogan accepted. Sports Illustrated writer Herbert Warren Wind and medical illustrator Anthony Ravielli were chosen as co-author and illustrator of the instructional, titled Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf.[222]
Originally serialized in Sports Illustrated beginning in March 1957, Five Lessons was printed in book form later that year and quickly became the best-selling golf instructional in history.[223] According to John Garrity, a former editor at Simon & Schuster, golf instructionals generally sold around 12,000 copies. He stated: ""There's only been a couple exceptions to that."" As of 2024, Five Lessons had been licensed to numerous publishers throughout the years and cumulatively sold over 1 million copies.[224]
Five Lessons was written in an authoritative style and used all capitals at times for emphasis.[224] It opened with a foreword, preface, and an introductory chapter titled ""The Fundamentals"". Each lesson in the book is a chapter: The Grip; Stance and Posture; The First Part of the Swing; The Second Part of the Swing; Summary and Review.[225] Sports psychologist Gio Valiante said in 2021: ""The tone of the 'Five Lessons' is consistent with [Hogan's] personality. Hogan was an efficient golfer; he had an efficient golf swing, and he was efficient with words.""[225] Hogan's goal for the instructional was to enable bogey golfers to break 80 regularly.[224] He later said the ""most important thing in the golf swing"" is the sequence of the body's movement, in particular that the lower body should initiate the downswing. He stated: ""Most people do it entirely opposite. They rotate their shoulders first instead of their lower body. As a result, they come across and hit the outside of the ball instead of the back of it.""[226]
Hogan's Five Lessons influenced golfers such as Lee Trevino[224][227] and Nick Faldo.[228][229] Instructor Jim Flick said in 2001 that much of the modern interpretation of the golf swing derives from the adjustments Hogan made to his own swing and his writings in Five Lessons. Flick stated that swing coaches had elaborated Hogan's instruction into ""a mechanical, big-muscle philosophy"" which ""neglected the soul that was at the heart of Ben Hogan's game,"" opining that Hogan was not a mechanical player but a ""feel player with a brilliant understanding of swing mechanics.""[230] Jaime Diaz, a writer who edited an anniversary edition of Five Lessons, stated in 2024: ""It's an anti-hook book. I mean, really weak grip and just making sure the club never turns over. It's a Tour player's swing. But even Tour players can't always replicate it.""[224]
Hogan became affiliated with the equipment company MacGregor Golf in 1937, after signing a contract worth $250 (equivalent to $5,468 in 2024).[231] When asked by MacGregor representative Toney Penna if he would use the MacGregor Tourney ball in 1953, Hogan said: ""Hell no! It's the worst golf ball ever made.""[118] He refused to use the ball during his 1953 season and his relationship with the company dissolved.[118] Hogan had decided prior to this that he would start his own golf equipment company.[231] In October 1953, he announced the creation of the Ben Hogan Company and sent a letter to club professionals asking them to support his venture.[232]  Hogan's perfectionism towards golf carried over to manufacturing, and in 1954 he scrapped the first batch of clubs that were produced due to them not meeting his standards.[233] The batch was worth around $100,000 (equivalent to $1.2 million in 2024), and Hogan's decision to scrap it led to the exit of an investor.[234]
Marketed as clubs for ""the better player"", the company utilized Hogan's image strongly in its advertising.[235] Due to a small budget, Hogan was unable to pay the top players at the time to use his clubs as they already had contracts with established brands such as MacGregor, Spalding, and Wilson.[236] Hogan sought to design top-end products and made innovations, such as fitting long irons with stiffer shafts than short irons. This idea was later adopted by other equipment manufacturers.[237] The company struggled to gain prominence against established rivals in the industry, and Hogan decided to sell the company as raising operating capital became troublesome.[238] It was acquired by American Machine and Foundry (AMF) in 1960, at a price of around $3.7 million (equivalent to $39 million in 2024). Hogan received cash as well as equity in AMF.[239]
After the sale to AMF, Hogan was appointed director of the Ben Hogan Golf Company and continued designing and manufacturing clubs.[238] He also had input in the company's sales and marketing policies. As the company used his name, Hogan viewed it as a representation of himself.[240] Hogan designed the Apex model of irons in 1972. It had a forged-blade style, which he favored over the cavity-back, investment-cast models that were beginning to gain popularity. Hogan believed such clubs reduced the player's feel and ability to discern if a shot had been struck properly.[241] The Apex line was successful, and it became a platform for Hogan's experimentation with weight distribution and sole design ideas. He also designed the Apex shaft, which James Achenbach of Golfweek said in 2013 is ""sometimes called golf's first lightweight shaft.""[242]
The company had sales of around $4 million in the late 1960s, but flourished in the 1970s and became the highest-selling club manufacturer in golf course shops. By 1980, sales had increased tenfold to over $40 million (equivalent to $153 million in 2024).[243] In late 1979, AMF appointed a new president, who reduced Hogan's role in the company and removed him from its commercials. The company also shifted focus from selling in shops at golf courses to off-course stores; the strategy was unsuccessful and the business began to struggle financially.[244] In 1984, AMF sold the Ben Hogan Golf Company to vulture investor Irwin L. Jacobs for $15 million (equivalent to $45 million in 2024).[245] This was part of Jacobs' hostile takeover of AMF, which was completed in 1985.[246] The company reported losses of $2.5 million in the year following the takeover. A new president was hired, who convinced Hogan that the company should release a line of easy-to-hit, cavity-backed irons for high handicap golfers, similar to ones marketed at the time by Ping. Hogan advertised the new clubs in television commercials and the company returned to profitability.[247]
In 1988, the company was acquired for $55 million (equivalent to $146 million in 2024) by Cosmo World, a group of Japanese investors who later bought Pebble Beach Golf Links.[245] After the acquisition, Hogan said: ""Mr. Isutani, you've bought the family jewels. Don't fuck it up.""[248] The company began primarily focusing on the Japanese market and Hogan's influence on the company decreased.[245] In 1992, Cosmo World was in financial distress and sold the company to Bill Goodwin,[249] for $61 million (equivalent to $137 million in 2024).[250] Goodwin had no background in golf and moved the manufacturing from its long-term base in Fort Worth to a plant in Richmond, Virginia.[239] Hogan's secretary Sharon Rea recalled: ""It very much saddened him when the company moved out of Fort Worth. He didn't have any children and this was his baby.""[245]
Revenue declined from over $60 million to around $10 million during Goodwin's ownership.[239][245] Following Hogan's death in 1997, the manufacturing returned to Fort Worth after the brand was bought by Spalding,[245][232] for $14.6 million (equivalent to $29 million in 2024).[251] In 2003, Spalding (then renamed Top-Flite) filed for bankruptcy.[245] Callaway bought the Top-Flite, Strata, and Ben Hogan brands out of bankruptcy for $125 million (equivalent to $214 million in 2024).[252] Callaway discontinued the Hogan brand in 2008, and sold the branding rights to Perry Ellis International in 2012.[232]
Hogan was selected as one of the thirteen inaugural inductees to the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974.[253] He received the 1976 Bob Jones Award, which is the United States Golf Association's highest honor.[254] A room at the USGA Museum was dedicated to him, named the Ben Hogan Room.[255][256] In 2012, a standalone Ben Hogan Museum was opened in his hometown Dublin, Texas.[257][258]
A biographical film about Hogan, titled Follow the Sun, was released in 1951, in which he was portrayed by Glenn Ford. It focuses on his early career, his relationship with his wife, the car accident, and his return to golf at the Los Angeles Open. Hogan served as technical advisor during the production. He insisted to director Sidney Lanfield that clubs used in the film should be realistic, and often interrupted filming to show Ford how to grip the club and how to address the ball. Hogan biographer Curt Sampson said: ""Ford, an unathletic man whose hobby was gardening, held the club as if it were a trowel and swung it like a rake.""[259] Hogan's contemporaries Byron Nelson and Sam Snead also had negative opinions of the film, but reviews from non-golfers were more favorable.[260] A documentary on Hogan by golf historian Fred Simmons was released in 1994, titled A Hard Case from Texas.[261] In 2019, Golf Channel produced Hogan, a two-part biopic on Hogan's life and legacy.[262]
Due to his success at the course, Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles was nicknamed ""Hogan's Alley"". In an 18-month stretch, he won three times at Riviera, twice when it hosted the Los Angeles Open and another when it was the venue for the 1948 U.S. Open.[263][264] Jimmy Demaret, who finished runner-up at the 1948 U.S. Open, said Hogan seemed unbeatable at Riviera.[66] Another course that became known as ""Hogan's Alley"" was Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth. Hogan won five times at the course when it hosted the Colonial National Invitation, including the inaugural edition in 1946. His last victory in a professional tournament came at Colonial in 1959.[153][158] In 1995, a seven-foot bronze statue of Hogan was installed at Colonial Country Club.[265] During the 1953 Open Championship at Carnoustie Golf Links, Hogan played the par-5 6th hole aggressively. Most of the field that year chose to lay up off the tee short of the bunkers on the right half. Hogan noticed he could reach the green in two if he aimed down the left, which brought out of bounds into play. He successfully targeted the left side en route to victory and the hole later became known as ""Hogan's Alley"".[130] Previously named ""Long"", the hole was officially renamed Hogan's Alley in 2003.[266][267]
In recognition of Hogan's win at the 1953 Masters Tournament, where he broke the scoring record, Augusta National Golf Club renamed the bridge which carries players across Rae's Creek to the 12th green as the Hogan Bridge in 1958.[268][269] Beginning in 1990, the Ben Hogan Award has been awarded annually to the top collegiate golfer in the United States.[270][271] Also in 1990, Hogan gave his name to the Ben Hogan Tour, a development tour which aimed to provide a pathway for players to reach the PGA Tour. When the tour was launched, he advised the players: ""Watch out for buses.""[272][273] The tour had multiple name changes through the years; as of 2020, it is called the Korn Ferry Tour for sponsorship reasons.[274]
Hogan is regarded as one of the greatest golfers in the history of the game. Golf Digest stated that, in 1970, Hogan was ""unquestionably thought to be the greatest golfer in history.""[161] In ESPN's SportsCentury list of the 50 greatest athletes of the 20th century, Hogan ranked at 38th. In 2000, Golf Digest ranked Hogan as the second greatest player of all time, behind Jack Nicklaus.[275] In The Golf 100, a 2025 ranking of the top 100 golfers in history, Nicklaus was first, Tiger Woods was second, Bobby Jones was third, Hogan was fourth, and Arnold Palmer was fifth.[276]
In particular, Hogan is considered among the finest ballstrikers in history.[277] Golf instructor David Leadbetter said in 2014 that there is ""no higher compliment"" than to say that a golfer is ""hitting it like Hogan.""[278] In 1967, the editor of Cary Middlecoff's 1974 book The Golf Swing watched every shot that 54-year-old Hogan hit at the Colonial National Invitational in Fort Worth. ""Hogan shot 281 for a third-place tie with George Archer. Of the 281 shots, 141 were taken in reaching the greens. Of the 141, 139 were rated from well-executed to superbly executed. The remaining two were a drive that missed the fairway by some 5 yards and a 5-iron to a par-3 hole that missed the green by about the same distance. It was difficult, if not impossible to conceive of anybody hitting the ball better over a four-day span.""[279] When asked in 2004 if Tiger Woods was the best ballstriker he had ever seen, Jack Nicklaus replied: ""No, no - Ben Hogan, easily"".[280] Also in 2004, amidst an attempt to change his swing, Woods said: ""Only two players have ever truly owned their swings: Moe Norman and Ben Hogan. I want to own mine."" Woods' coach at the time, Hank Haney, stated the goal was to mould Woods' swing into one more similar to Hogan, Norman, and Lee Trevino.[281]
Charles McGrath of The New York Times said in 1998 that Hogan, with ""his perfectionism and his elegant, un-logoed wardrobe,"" had done more than anyone else to bring the PGA Tour ""from its rowdy, barnstorming days into the modern era of professionalism.""[187] Major champion Johnny Miller proclaimed in a 2013 Golf.com interview: ""Ben is more respected for the quality of his shots than any golfer ever in history and that includes Woods or Nicklaus—nobody has been copied more than Ben Hogan and his book has been copied more than any book ever.""[282]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_film,Concert film,"A concert film or concert movie is a film that showcases a live performance from the perspective of a concert goer, the subject of which is an extended live performance or concert, by either a musician[2] or a stand-up comedian.[3]
One of the earliest-known concert films is the 1944 film Adventure in Music.[4] Another early film is the 1948 picture Concert Magic. This concert features virtuoso violinist Yehudi Menuhin (1916–1999) at the Charlie Chaplin Studios in 1947. Together with various artists he performed classical and romantic works of famous composers such as Beethoven, Wieniawski, Bach, Paganini and others.[5]
The earliest known jazz concert film is the 1959 film Jazz on a Summer's Day. The film was recorded during the fifth annual Newport Jazz Festival.[6] The earliest known rock concert film is Rock’n’Roll, a 1959 feature film produced by the promoter Lee Gordon. As it also features some Jazz performances and was released prior to Jazz on a Summers Day, it arguably has claims to being the first Jazz concert film as well.
A latter notable concert film, the  T.A.M.I. Show,  featured acts such as The Beach Boys, James Brown, Marvin Gaye, and the Rolling Stones.[7]
One of popular music's most ground-breaking concert films is Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii (1972), directed by Adrian Maben, in which Pink Floyd perform a short set of songs inside the amphitheatre of Pompeii without an audience (save for the recording crew).
The term ""rockumentary"" was first used by Bill Drake in the 1969 History of Rock & Roll radio broadcast and is a portmanteau of ""rock"" and ""documentary"".[8][9] The term was subsequently used to describe concert films containing appearances by multiple artists.[10][11] Then, in 1976, the term was used by the promoters of the live musical production Beatlemania which documented the evolving career of The Beatles.[12] The 1984 mockumentary film This Is Spinal Tap notably parodied the rockumentary genre.[13]
Other examples of this type of film include Menudo's 1981 film, Menudo: La Película, and Duran Duran's 85-minute 1984 video, Sing Blue Silver. The former mixes a Menudo concert (in Merida, Venezuela) with movie scenes and a plot, while the latter follows Duran Duran as they travel around Canada and the United States doing concerts and actual tourism.
Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, which has grossed $267 million worldwide,[14][15] is the highest-grossing concert film of all time. The record was previously held by Justin Bieber: Never Say Never (2011).[16][17]The top 15 are among the highest-grossing concert films. André Rieu is the most frequent performance with 13 titles on the list.

Gamer Network Limited (formerly Eurogamer Network Limited) is a British digital media company based in London. Founded in 1999 by Rupert and Nick Loman, it owns brands—primarily editorial websites—relating to video game journalism and other video game businesses. Its flagship website, Eurogamer, was launched alongside the company. It began hosting the video game trade show EGX in 2008. ReedPop acquired Gamer Network in 2018 and sold it to IGN Entertainment in 2024.
Gamer Network was founded under the name Eurogamer Network in 1999 by brothers Rupert and Nick Loman.[1] It was formed alongside the opening of its flagship website, Eurogamer, which itself launched on 4 September 1999.[1][2] Nick Loman left the business in 2004 to pursue a career in medicine and ""competitive BBQ"".[3]
In February 2011, Eurogamer Network acquired American publishing house Hammersuit, alongside its IndustryGamers.com and Modojo.com websites.[4] On 1 March 2013, in line with the international expansion, Eurogamer Network announced that it had changed its name to Gamer Network.[5] As part of the rebranding, Eurogamer Events was renamed Gamer Events, while Hammersuit also adopted the Gamer Network name.[5] In October, Simon Maxwell was promoted from group publishing director to chief operating officer.[6]
On 26 February 2018, it was announced that ReedPop, the division of Reed Exhibitions that organises pop culture conventions such as PAX, had acquired Gamer Network.[1] While Rupert Loman remained Gamer Network's chief executive officer, Maxwell became the company's managing director and a vice-president for ReedPop's UK operations.[1][7] Loman left the company in February 2020.[8] ReedPop implemented a number of layoffs across many of the Gamer Network sites in September 2020. In November 2020, the remaining USgamer staff, which had been reduced from nine to four after the earlier layoffs, reported that ReedPop was shuttering the site by the end of the year.[9]
In November 2023, ReedPop announced its intent to sell Gamer Network with its editorial brands, though excluding its events business.[10] IGN Entertainment was announced as the buyer in May 2024, and it immediately implemented layoffs of some editorial staff at GamesIndustry.biz and Rock Paper Shotgun.[11] Following the takeover, Dicebreaker cancelled their Tabletop Creators Summit at MCM Comic Con.[12][13] In an overview on the state of tabletop gaming journalism, Chase Carter of Rascal News highlighted that ""the other professional website that fostered amateur talent, Dicebreaker, seems to be poised on the edge of collapse"".[14] Carter, who formerly freelanced for Dicebreaker, commented that nothing has been published since the May 21 sale of the Gamer Network and the outlet's ""ultimate fate remains unknown at time of writing"" in June 2024.[14] Later that month, the Dicebreaker staff reported that they were made redundant.[15][16]
In October 2015, Gamer Network site VG247 retracted their preview of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and issued an apology after being contacted by the publisher that the game they had played was Uncharted 2: Among Thieves from the remastered Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection.[62]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN,IGN,"

IGN[b] is an American video gaming and entertainment media website operated by IGN Entertainment Inc., a subsidiary of Ziff Davis, Inc. The company's headquarters is located in San Francisco's SoMa district and is headed by its former editor-in-chief, Peer Schneider. The IGN website was the brainchild of media entrepreneur Chris Anderson and launched on September 29, 1996. IGN features articles on games, films, anime, television, comics, technology, and other media. Originally a network of desktop websites, IGN is also distributed on mobile platforms, console programs available on the Xbox and PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, PC, Mobile, FireTV, Roku, and via YouTube, Twitch, Hulu, and Snapchat.
Originally, IGN was the flagship website of IGN Entertainment, a website which owned and operated several other websites oriented towards players' interests, games, and entertainment, such as Rotten Tomatoes, GameSpy, GameStats, VE3D, TeamXbox, Vault Network, FilePlanet, and AskMen. IGN was sold to publishing company Ziff Davis in February 2013.
IGN was created in September 1996 as the Imagine Games Network, the IGN content network was founded by publishing executive Jonathan Simpson-Bint and began as five individual websites within Imagine Media: N64.com (later renamed ign64.com), PSXPower, Saturnworld, Next-Generation.com and Ultra Game Players Online.[2] Imagine expanded on its owned-and-operated websites by creating an affiliate network that included a number of independent fansites such as PSX Nation.com, Sega-Saturn.com, Game Sages, and GameFAQs. In 1998, the network launched a new homepage that consolidated the individual sites as system channels under the IGN brand. The homepage exposed content from more than 30 different channels. Websites Next-Generation and Ultra Game Players Online were not part of this consolidation; U.G.P.O. dissolved with the cancellation of the magazine, and Next-Generation was put ""on hold"" when Imagine decided to concentrate on launching the short-lived Daily Radar brand.
In February 1999, PC Magazine named IGN one of the hundred-best websites, alongside competitors GameSpot and CNET Gamecenter.[3] That same month, Imagine Media incorporated a spin-off that included IGN and its affiliate channels as Affiliation Networks, while Simpson-Bint remained at the former company. In September, the newly spun-out standalone internet media company, changed its name to Snowball.com. At the same time, small entertainment website The Den merged into IGN and added non-gaming content to the growing network. Snowball held an IPO in 2000, but shed most of its other properties during the dot-com bubble. IGN prevailed with growing audience numbers and a newly established subscription service called IGN Insider (later IGN Prime), which led to the shedding of the name ""Snowball"" and adoption of IGN Entertainment on May 10, 2002.
In June 2005, IGN reported having 24,000,000 unique visitors per month, with 4.8 million registered users through all departments of the site. IGN has been ranked among the top 500 most-visited websites according to Alexa.[4] In September 2005, IGN was acquired by Rupert Murdoch's multimedia business empire, News Corporation, for $650 million.[5] IGN celebrated its 10th anniversary on January 12, 2008.[6] IGN was headquartered in the Marina Point Parkway office park in Brisbane, California, until it relocated to a smaller office building near AT&T Park in San Francisco on March 29, 2010. On May 25, 2011, IGN sold its Direct2Drive division to Gamefly for an undisclosed amount.[7]
In 2011, IGN Entertainment acquired its rival UGO Entertainment (owners of 1Up.com) from Hearst Corporation. Ultimately, News Corp. planned to spin off IGN Entertainment as a publicly traded company, continuing a string of divestitures for digital properties it had previously acquired (including MySpace and Photobucket).[8]
On February 4, 2013, after a failed attempt to spin off IGN as a separate company, News Corp. announced that it had sold IGN Entertainment to the publishing company Ziff Davis, which was recently acquired by J2 Global. Financial details regarding the purchase were not revealed. Prior to its acquisition by UGO, 1UP.com had previously been owned by Ziff Davis.[9] Soon after the acquisition, IGN announced that it would be laying off staff and closing GameSpy, 1UP.com, and UGO in order to focus on its flagship brands, IGN and AskMen.[10]
The role-playing video game interest website Vault Network was acquired by IGN in 1999.[11] GameStats, a review aggregation website, was founded by IGN in 2004. GameStats includes a ""GPM"" (Game Popularity Metric) rating system which incorporates an average press score and average gamer score, as well as the number of page hits for the game.[12] However, the site is no longer being updated. The Xbox interest site, TeamXbox, and the PC game website VE3D were acquired in 2003.[13][14] IGN Entertainment merged with GameSpy Industries in 2005.[15] The merger also brought the game download site FilePlanet into the IGN group; as of 2011 both FilePlanet and the GameSpy website still operate as video game-related web sites. IGN Entertainment acquired the online male lifestyle magazine AskMen in 2005.[16] In 2004, IGN acquired film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes and in 2010, sold the website to Flixster.[17] In October 2017, Humble Bundle announced that it was being acquired by IGN.[18]
IGN Entertainment acquired Gamer Network and its properties in May 2024 for an undisclosed sum. These included Eurogamer, Rock Paper Shotgun, VG247 and others. As a result, some layoffs were made due to redundancies.[19]
A member of the IGN staff writes a review for a game and gives it a score between 0.1 and 10.0, which is assigned by increments of 0.1 and determines how much the game is recommended. The score is given according to the ""individual aspects of a game, like presentation, graphics, sound, gameplay and lasting appeal"". Each game is given a score in each of these categories, but the overall score for the game is an independent evaluation, not an average of the scores in each category.[20]
On August 3, 2010, IGN announced that the site would be changing to a new scoring scale. Instead of a 100-point scale, where games are scored in increments of 0.1, all future reviews would use a 20-point scale where games are scored in increments of 0.5. Under both systems, the maximum possible score a game can receive is 10.0. The scoring change was not retroactive: all scores on reviews written before the change would remain the same. This change also did not affect the scoring system for reader reviews.
On September 13, 2012, IGN revealed that as part of its new review format all future reviews would follow a 100-point scale again, but without using decimals, meaning a score of 8.5 would become an 85. Unlike the previous conversion to the 20-point scale, this latest scoring system change was retroactive and all previous IGN review scores were to be updated to follow the new system. However, despite the announcement, the article included a short addition, post-release; it stated that after much discussion, they had decided to retain the decimal point in all upcoming scores.[21]
In early 2014, IGN introduced a new policy, in which a game's review score can be re-reviewed and improved, provided that continuous updates form a significant change compared to the game at launch. Examples of games that have been re-reviewed were League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, Warframe, and the pocket edition of Minecraft.[22]
In January 2020, IGN revealed that reviews would be reverted to a 10-point scale, from 1 to 10, finding that the finer distinction of the 100-point scale was difficult to maintain, whereas a 10-point scale would still be true to its reviews and would be easier to promote.[23]
IGN's 'Best of' is an end-of-year event to annually honor the year's best games, films, television shows and comics.[24] Winners of each award category are selected by IGN staff from a list of nominees, while readers are able to cast their own votes online to determine the 'People's Choice' award for each category.
In 2000, Snowball.com purchased an E-federation called the Internet Wrestling Organization (IWO).[25] Since Snowball owned both IWO and IGN, IWO would go on to become IGN's first official E-Fed, even doing a column on the website. The IGN For Men section officially closed down on October 2, 2001, and is no longer updated. IGN has sites such as IGN Stars and AskMen.com that fulfil much of the function of the old IGN For Men site. IGN Wrestling met its end in early 2002 when many of the staff departed. Interviews with professional wrestling personalities and coverage of wrestling games have been folded into IGN Sports, headed by Jon Robinson. IGN Sci-Fi: Largely dead since 2002, this section of the site included movie news, comic book reviews, anime coverage and other associated items. It has since been discontinued. The site, SciFI.ign.com redirects to the recently created SciFiBrain.ign.com, which covers some of the content of the old Sci-Fi site.[citation needed]
In 2002, IGN launched a dedicated video game FAQs site specifically designed to host user-submitted guides.[26] This was launched following the cancellation of affiliation with GameFAQs.[citation needed] In 2004, IGN launched GameStats, which was intended to be a more unbiased rating network, as it takes in scores from every corporate-owned game rating site and averages them all into one score to give a general idea of the quality of a game. IGN also launched Direct2Drive.com in 2004. Its primary focus is selling digital downloads of full PC and Mac video games, as well as anime, comics and game guides. In 2005, IGN launched its comics site, which is devoted to not just the staple Marvel and DC titles, but also manga, graphic novels, statues and toys.[citation needed]
In 2006, IGN launched its television site. It provides interviews with various television celebrities, in addition to a TV schedule, TV trivia and TV news. Like the film section, IGN's TV section has a variety of exclusive clips from upcoming television shows.[citation needed]
On May 30, 2006, IGN Dreamcast was restarted; however, none of the Dreamcast updates were posted on the main IGN webpage.[citation needed]
In 2007, IGN launched its anime site. It provided features on anime and manga, including trailers and free episodes. It also included reviews of manga and anime from other sections of IGN, such as IGN Comics and IGN DVD. The anime channel was dropped after IGN redesigned the site. In 2008, the IGN Retro channel was launched to mark IGN's 10th anniversary.[27] To coincide with the release of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, IGN created the Super Smash Bros. World site. On the site, people can submit their user-created stages from the game and download ones made by other people. IGN subsequently launched a similar website called GTA 'Hood on April 29, 2008, for Grand Theft Auto IV.[citation needed]
Along with its popular website content, IGN also publishes many different podcasts on both its website and on iTunes. Some of its podcasts include console-oriented shows like the PlayStation-focused ""Podcast Beyond"" and the Xbox-oriented ""Podcast Unlocked"", the Nintendo-oriented ""Nintendo Voice Chat"", and Game Scoop!, a podcast where a variety of editors discuss news and topics surrounding the video game industry.[28]
IGN has 28 editions in 25 languages, as of 2021.[29] The US & Canada, UK & Ireland, and Australia & New Zealand editions are operated by Ziff Davis subsidiaries, with all others being franchised publishers. Since 2006, IGN Entertainment began launching regional versions of the website for various countries and pan-regions. Initially, IGN began opening new offices outside the United States in order to support those regional websites, but later IGN began franchising its brand as a more cost-effective means of globalization, wherein it licensed various media publishers in many countries to use the IGN brand and manage regional websites on their own. Licensed regional publishers work on their own servers, albeit can link to IGN's HQ database, where they can import or translate articles, and use videos uploaded on IGN's servers that use IGN's own hosted video player.[citation needed]
When visiting www.ign.com from an IGN-supported region, the site automatically redirects visitors to their localized version using geolocation software, based on their countries' IP addresses. Each version of the site has a modified logo with their country's/region's respective flags near the IGN logo. However, it is still possible to access the original American website using a navigation bar above or below (depending on the regional website) the page's master template.[citation needed]
IGN Convention (IGN Con) is a video games, movies, comics and pop culture convention held in various cities in the Middle East. The event generally includes celebrities, video game tournaments, table top games, card games, movie previews, comic book stalls and a cosplay competition. A number of Middle Eastern artists and game developers also showcase their work at IGN Convention. This convention is owned and operated by IGN Middle East, the Middle Eastern edition of popular video games website IGN.
IGN Convention is the spiritual successor to GameFest, a biannual, smaller scale gaming gallery which was originally hosted by IGN Middle East's parent company T-break Media between 2010 and 2012,[53] before the hosting duties were subsequently taken over by AMD EMEA. The IGN Convention logo was designed by prominent Gulf based artist Ashraf Ghori.
Conferences have included:
In 2011, IGN launched IGN Pro League, a professional esports circuit that ran tournaments for StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, ShootMania Storm and League of Legends.[54] On March 6, 2013, only weeks prior to the event, IGN abruptly canceled the finals of IPL 6—which were to be held in Las Vegas from March 28 through 31, and discontinued the league. IGN indicated that it was no longer in a position to commit to compete with the increasing number of esports events that were being held.[55][56] On April 8, 2013, Blizzard Entertainment announced that it had acquired the staff and assets of the IPL from IGN; its former staff were reassigned to work on in-house esports productions.[57]
In 2007, Video Game Media Watch accused former IGN editor Doug Perry of ""journalistic misconduct"" for an exclusive review of Prey.[58][59]
In November 2017, some IGN employees refused to work to show solidarity with Kallie Plagge, a former editor who alleged that in 2016, another editor, Vince Ingenito, sexually harassed her and another female employee and made inappropriate comments. Human resources allegedly told her that she ""needed to have better judgment about who [she] was 'friends' with"" and that she was an ""equal participant"" in ""inappropriate flirtation"". This incident was widely circulated across social media.[60][61]
In August 2018, the owner of YouTube channel Boomstick Gaming accused the IGN reviewer Filip Miucin of plagiarizing his video review of the game Dead Cells.[62] On August 7, IGN stated that it had found ""substantial similarities"" between the reviews, apologized, and announced that it had dismissed Miucin.[62] On August 10, IGN published a new review by Brandin Tyrrel, which included an editor's note apologizing again and stating that ""this review (and its score) represents solely the opinion of the new reviewer"".[63]
In a subsequently unlisted video,[64][65] Miucin responded that while he took ""complete ownership over what happened"", the similarity was not intentional.[66] Kotaku found similarities between Miucin's other reviews, reviews on Nintendo Life and Engadget[67] and material posted on the games discussion forum NeoGAF.[68] On August 14, IGN announced that it would remove all of Miucin's work pending further review.[68] On April 19, 2019, Miucin admitted plagiarism and issued an apology on his YouTube channel.[69]
During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, the main IGN site posted an article on May 14 urging readers to donate to charities helping Palestinian civilians such as the Palestine Children's Relief Fund and linked to relevant news reporting.[70][71] A Palestinian flag was also added besides the IGN logo.[71] Shortly after the article went up IGN Israel made statements on social media condemning the article.[72] The Palestinian flag was soon replaced with a Red Cross.[70] On May 16, the article was deleted and a statement was made on the IGN Twitter account saying that it was wrong to only highlight one side of the conflict.[71] A reposted version on South Africa-based IGN Africa was also removed.[72] On May 17, over 60 members of IGN's staff signed an open letter condemning the article's removal for going against the site's editorial freedom and policies for retracting or correcting articles, as well as the lack of communication with IGN staff.[70] IGN reinstated the article on August 24 under a new headline alongside a statement of newly formalized editorial policies.[73]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter,The Hollywood Reporter,"
The Hollywood Reporter (THR) is an American digital and print magazine which focuses on the film, television, theatre, and entertainment industries. It was founded in 1930 as a daily trade paper, and in 2010 switched to a weekly large-format print magazine with a revamped website. As of 2020, the day-to-day operations of the company are handled by Penske Media Corporation through a joint venture with Eldridge Industries. 
The Hollywood Reporter has international editions in several countries. The magazine also sponsors and hosts major industry events.
The Hollywood Reporter was founded in 1930 by William R. ""Billy"" Wilkerson (1890–1962) as Hollywood's first daily entertainment trade newspaper.[1] The first edition appeared on September 3, 1930, and featured Wilkerson's front-page ""Tradeviews"" column,[2] which became influential. The newspaper appeared Monday-to-Saturday for the first 10 years, except for a brief period, then Monday-to-Friday from 1940. Wilkerson used caustic articles and gossip to generate publicity and was noticed by the studio bosses in New York and some studio lots tried to ban the paper.[3]
In 1932, Variety sued The Hollywood Reporter, alleging that THR was plagiarizing information from Variety following its publication in New York on Tuesdays, by way of phoning or wiring the information back to Hollywood, so that THR could publish the information before Variety reached Hollywood three days later on Friday.[4] Then, in 1933, Variety started its own daily Hollywood edition, Daily Variety, to cover the film industry.[5]
Screenwriter and ardent anti-Communist[6] Jack Moffitt, who had written the scripts for dozens of films during Hollywood's Golden Age and was the father of model and actress Peggy Moffitt,  wrote many reviews for THR[7][8][9] after being hired by  Wilkerson in 1955.[6]
Wilkerson became friends with Howard Hughes and the paper wrote many favorable stories about him and his film plans. In return, Hughes, in addition to advertising revenue, also provided financial assistance to the paper when necessary.[3]
Wilkerson ran The Hollywood Reporter until his death in September 1962, although his final column appeared 18 months prior.[10] Wilkerson's wife, Tichi Wilkerson Kassel, took over as publisher and editor-in-chief when her husband died.[11]
From the late 1930s, Wilkerson used The Hollywood Reporter to push the view that the industry was a communist stronghold. In particular, he opposed the screenplay writers' trade union, the Screen Writers Guild, which he called the ""Red Beachhead"".[12][13] In 1946 the Guild considered creating an American Authors' Authority to hold copyright for writers, instead of ownership passing to the studios. Wilkerson devoted his ""Tradeviews"" column to the issue on July 29, 1946, headlined ""A Vote for Joe Stalin."" He went to confession before publishing it, knowing the damage it would cause, but was apparently encouraged by the priest to go ahead with it.[12][14]
The column contained the first industry names, including Dalton Trumbo and Howard Koch, on what became the Hollywood blacklist, known as ""Billy's list"". Eight of the 11 people Wilkerson named were among the ""Hollywood Ten"" who were blacklisted after hearings in 1947 by the House Un-American Activities Committee.[12][15] When Wilkerson died in 1962, his THR obituary said that he had ""named names, pseudonyms and card numbers and was widely credited with being chiefly responsible for preventing communists from becoming entrenched in Hollywood production.""[12]
In 1997 THR reporter David Robb wrote a story about the newspaper's involvement, but the editor, Robert J. Dowling, declined to run it. For the blacklist's 65th anniversary in 2012, the THR published a lengthy investigative piece about Wilkerson's role, by reporters Gary Baum and Daniel Miller.[12] The same edition carried an apology from Wilkerson's son W. R. Wilkerson III. He wrote that his father had been motivated by revenge for his thwarted ambition to own a studio.[16]
On April 11, 1988, Tichi Wilkerson Kassel sold the paper to BPI Communications, owned by Affiliated Publications, for $26.7 million.[17] Robert J. Dowling became THR president in 1988, and editor-in-chief and publisher in 1991.[10] Dowling hired Alex Ben Block as editor in 1990. Block and Teri Ritzer damped much of the sensationalism and cronyism that was prominent in the paper under the Wilkersons. In 1994, BPI Communications was sold to Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen (VNU) for $220 million.[18]
In March 2006 a private equity consortium led by Blackstone and KKR, both with ties to the conservative movement in the United States, acquired THR along with the other assets of VNU.[19] It joined those publications with AdWeek and A.C. Nielsen to form The Nielsen Company.[20]
Matthew King, vice president for content and audience, editorial director Howard Burns, and executive editor Peter Pryor left the paper in a wave of layoffs in December 2006; editor Cynthia Littleton, widely respected throughout the industry, reported directly to Kilcullen. The Reporter absorbed another blow when Littleton left her position for an editorial job at Variety in March 2007. Web editor Glenn Abel also left after 16 years with the paper.[21]
From 1988 to 2014, Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter were both located on Wilshire Boulevard, along Miracle Mile. In March 2007, The Hollywood Reporter surpassed Daily Variety to achieve the largest total distribution of any entertainment daily.[22]
In December 2009, Prometheus Global Media, a newly formed company formed by Pluribus Capital Management and Guggenheim Partners, and chaired by Jimmy Finkelstein, CEO of News Communications, parent of political journal The Hill, acquired THR from Nielsen Business Media. It pledged to invest in the brand and grow the company.[23] Richard Beckman, formerly of Condé Nast, was appointed as CEO.[24]
In 2010, Beckman recruited Janice Min, the former editor-in-chief of Us Weekly, as editorial director to ""eviscerate"" the existing daily trade paper and reinvent it as a glossy, large-format weekly magazine.[25][26] The Hollywood Reporter relaunched with a weekly print edition and a revamped website that enabled it to break news. Eight months after its initial report, The New York Times took note of the many scoops THR had generated, adding that the new glossy format seemed to be succeeding with its ""rarefied demographic"", stating: ""They managed to change the subject by going weekly... The large photos, lush paper stock and great design are a kind of narcotic here.""[27]
In 2011, Deadline Hollywood, a property of Penske Media Corporation, sued The Hollywood Reporter for more than $5 million, alleging copyright infringement. In 2013, THR's parent company settled the suit. According to The Wall Street Journal, ""The lawsuit [was] widely viewed in Hollywood as a proxy for the bitter war for readers and advertising dollars... The two sides agreed on a statement reading in part: 'Prometheus admits that The Hollywood Reporter copied source code from Penske Media Corporation's Web site www.tvline.com; Prometheus and The Hollywood Reporter have apologized to Penske Media.'""[28]
By February 2013 the Times returned to THR, filing a report on a party for Academy Award nominees the magazine had hosted at the Los Angeles restaurant Spago. Noting the crowd of top celebrities in attendance, the Times alluded to the fact that many Hollywood insiders were now referring to THR as ""the new Vanity Fair"". Ad sales since Min's hiring were up more than 50%, while traffic to the magazine's website had grown by 800%.[29]
In January 2014, Janice Min was promoted to President/Chief Creative Officer of the Entertainment Group of Guggenheim Media, giving her oversight of THR and its sister brand Billboard.[30] Min is joined by co-president John Amato, who is responsible for business initiatives.[31][32]
Guggenheim Partners announced on December 17, 2015, that it would sell the Prometheus media properties to its executive Todd Boehly.[33][34][35] The company was sold to Eldridge Industries in February 2017.[36][37] On February 1, 2018, Eldridge Industries announced the merger of its media properties with Media Rights Capital to form Valence Media (later rebranded in 2020 as simply MRC).[38][39][40]
In February 2017, Min announced she was stepping down from her role as President/Chief Creative Officer overseeing The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard to take on a new role at its parent company. Simultaneously, it was announced that longtime executive editor Matthew Belloni would take over as editorial director.[41]
In April 2020, Belloni announced he was stepping down after 14 years at the publication in the wake of recent clashes with the company's leadership over editorial issues.[42] At the end of April 2020, The Hollywood Reporter (THR) named Nekesa Mumbi Moody as the editorial director who was expected to begin on June 15, 2020.[43]
In September 2020, Penske Media assumed the day-to-day operations of Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter through a joint venture with MRC known as PMRC. The agreement also included opportunities for MRC to develop content based on PMC's publications.[40]
Established in 2020, PMRC is the parent company of THR, Variety, Rolling Stone, Billboard, Vibe, Music Business Worldwide, the annual Life is Beautiful music festival and an investment in the SXSW festival franchise that is expanding beyond its US roots next year with an edition in Sydney, Australia.[44]
In April 2020, at least 20 staffers were laid off, including executive vice president and group publisher Lynne Segall.[45]
On August 5, 2022, Boehly pulled out of the MRC joint venture, and bought back the assets he had contributed to it, including The Hollywood Reporter.[44]
In June 2023, at least three staffers were laid off.[46] A year later The Hollywood Reporter laid off a small number of editorial workers.[47]
Founder Billy Wilkerson served as the publisher of THR until his death in September 1962.[10] Wilkerson's wife, Tichi Wilkerson Kassel, took over as publisher and editor-in-chief when her husband died.[11]
Robert J. Dowling, who was named president of THR when Kassel sold the company, became editor-in-chief and publisher in 1991.[10]
Tony Uphoff assumed the publisher position in November 2005.[48]
John Kilcullen replaced Uphoff in October 2006, as publisher of Billboard.[49][50][51] Kilcullen was a defendant in Billboard's infamous ""dildo"" lawsuit, in which he was accused of race discrimination and sexual harassment.[19] VNU settled the suit on the courthouse steps.[52] Kilcullen ""exited"" Nielsen in February 2008 ""to pursue his passion as an entrepreneur.""[53]
In April 2010, Lori Burgess was named as publisher. Burgess had been publisher of OK! magazine since October 2008. Michaela Apruzzese was named associate publisher, entertainment in May 2010.[54] Apruzzese previously served as the director of movie advertising for Los Angeles Times Media Group.
Lynne Segall, former vice president and associate publisher, was named publisher and senior vice president in June 2011.[55]
The weekly print edition of The Hollywood Reporter includes profiles, original photography and interviews with entertainment figures; articles about major upcoming releases and product launches; film reviews and film festival previews; coverage of the latest industry deals, TV ratings, box-office figures and analysis of global entertainment business trends and indicators; photos essays and reports from premieres and other red-carpet events; and the latest on Hollywood fashion and lifestyle.[56][57]
The Reporter published a primitive ""satellite"" digital edition in the late 1980s. It became the first daily entertainment trade paper to start a website in 1995.[58] Initially, the site offered free news briefs with complete coverage firewalled as a premium paid service. In later years, the website became mostly free as it became more reliant on ad sales and less on subscribers. The website had already gone through a redesign by the time competitor Variety took to the web in 1998. In 2002 the Reporter's website won the Jesse H. Neal Award for business journalism. In November 2013, The Hollywood Reporter launched the style site Pret-a-Reporter.[59]
THR.com, The Hollywood Reporter's website, re-launched in 2010, offers breaking entertainment news, reviews and blogs; original video content (and film and TV clips) and photo galleries; plus in-depth movie, television, music, awards, style, technology and business coverage. The website includes a blog called Heat Vision, which covers comic books, science fiction, and horror content.[60] As of August 2013, Comscore measured 12 million unique visitors per month to the site.[61]
THR's editors have included Janice Min (2010–2017), Elizabeth Guider (2007–2010), Cynthia Littleton (2005–2007), Howard Burns (2001–2006), Anita Busch (1999–2001), and Alex Ben Block (1990–1999).
Alex Ben Block was hired as editor for special issues in 1990, and was promoted to editor of the daily edition in 1992.[62] After Block left, former Variety film editor, Anita Busch, became editor between 1999 and 2001. Busch was credited with making the paper competitive with Variety.
In March 2006, Cynthia Littleton, former broadcast television editor and deputy editor, was named editor, but left the role a year later for an editorial job at Variety.[21] In July 2007 THR named Elizabeth Guider as its new editor. An 18-year veteran of Variety, where she served as Executive Editor, Guider assumed responsibility for the editorial vision and strategic direction of The Hollywood Reporter's daily and weekly editions, digital content offerings and executive conferences. Guider left The Hollywood Reporter in early 2010.[63]
In addition to hiring Eric Mika, Rose Eintstein and Elizabeth Guider, the Reporter hired the following staff in 2007:
However, staffing levels began to drop again in 2008. In April, Nielsen Business Media eliminated between 40 and 50 editorial staff positions at The Hollywood Reporter and its sister publications: Adweek, Brandweek, Editor & Publisher and Mediaweek.[64] In December, another 12 editorial positions were cut at the trade paper.[65] In addition, 2008 saw substantial turnover in the online department: THR.com Editor Melissa Grego left her position in July to become executive editor of Broadcasting & Cable,[66] and Managing Editor Scott McKim left to become a new media manager at Knox College. With the entertainment industry as a whole shrinking, ""Hollywood studios have cut more than $20 million from the Motion Picture Association of America budget this year. The resulting staff and program reductions are expected to permanently shrink the scope and size of the six-studio trade and advocacy group.""[67]
Staffing at THR in 2008 saw even further cutbacks with ""names from today's tragic bloodletting of The Hollywood Reporter's staff"" adding up quickly in the hard economic times at the end of 2008.[68] ""The trade has not only been thin, but only publishing digital version 19 days this holiday season. Film writers Leslie Simmons, Carolyn Giardina, Gregg Goldstein, plus lead TV critic Barry Garron and TV reporter Kimberly Nordyke, also special issues editor Randee Dawn Cohen out of New York and managing editor Harley Lond and international department editor Hy Hollinger, plus Dan Evans, Lesley Goldberg, Michelle Belaski, James Gonzalez were among those chopped from the masthead.""[68]
Gossip blogger Roger Friedman joined The Hollywood Reporter as a senior correspondent in May 2009, a year after being fired by Fox News for writing an article reviewing an illegally bootlegged copy of the movie X-Men Origins: Wolverine.[69][70] Business Insider described it as a surprising and risky move.[71] In March 2010, Friedman's employment agreement was not renewed by The Hollywood Reporter.[72]
When Janice Min and Lori Burgess came on board in 2010, the editorial and sales staff increased nearly 50%, respectively. Min hired various recognized journalists in the entertainment industry, most notably Variety film critic Todd McCarthy[73] after his firing from Variety in March 2010, as well as Kim Masters of NPR, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle, Lacey Rose of Forbes, Pamela McClintock of Variety and Eriq Gardner of American Lawyer.[74][75]
The Hollywood Reporter sponsors and hosts a number of major industry events and awards ceremonies. It hosted 13 such events in 2012, including the Women in Entertainment Breakfast, where it announced its annual Power 100 list of the industry's most powerful women;[76] the Key Art Awards (for achievement in entertainment advertising and communications); Power Lawyers Breakfast; Next Gen (honoring the industry's 50 fastest-rising stars and executives age 35 and under); Nominees Night; and the 25 Most Powerful Stylists Luncheon.
The Hollywood Reporter has produced the group interview shows Close Up with The Hollywood Reporter and Off Script with The Hollywood Reporter.[77][78]
Since 2013, The Hollywood Reporter has published an annual feature called ""Brutally Honest Oscar Ballot"" where anonymous members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences explain their voting choices for the Academy Awards (Oscars). The feature was first published in February 2013 as a single interview with an anonymous director titled ""An Oscar Voter's Brutally Honest Ballot"".[79] The magazine typically publishes three to four interviews each year. The Washington Post called the feature ""the best part of Oscar season"".[80]
In April 2023, the Academy introduced a rule change aimed at curtailing the feature, saying that Academy voters ""may not discuss [their] voting preferences and other members' voting preferences in a public forum. This includes comparing or ranking motion pictures, performances, or achievements in relation to voting. This also includes speaking with press anonymously.""[81]
The Hollywood Reporter Japan was launched in February 2023 in Japan as the first international edition of The Hollywood Reporter.[82] The Hollywood Reporter Japan is published by Hersey Shiga Global under license from The Hollywood Reporter, LLC.[83] It covers film, TV and entertainment news with a special focus on the Japanese Film and TV market, which includes Japan's vast anime industry and talent agencies. Its chairman is Tsukasa Shiga.[84]
The Hollywood Reporter Roma was launched in April 2023 in Italy as the first European edition of The Hollywood Reporter.[85][86] The Hollywood Reporter Roma is published by Brainstore Media under license from The Hollywood Reporter, LLC. It is a multimedia platform covering local, national and European events aimed at the global market, with a focus on the Italian film, TV industry and culture.[86] Concita De Gregorio was appointed as the magazine's first chairman,[86][87] and served in the role until February 2024,[88][89] being subsequently replaced by Boris Sollazzo.[90] Since March of the same year, the writing staff of The Hollywood Reporter Roma publicly denounced the state of financial crisis affecting the magazine, with journalists, translators and external contributors reportedly not getting paid for months; an Il Post inquiry revealed a significant discrepancy between Brainstore Media's declared budget and the original financial plan presented by the company to PMRC in the due diligence phase.[91] On 1 July, Sollazzo and the rest of the writing staff officially resigned from their jobs at the magazine.[92] Since July 2024, the management has been assigned to Alessio De Giorgi.[93]
In October 2024, an application for a composition agreement was filed with the Civil Court of Rome against Brainstore Media; given the inadmissibility of the application due to the company's failure to submit an agreement, on 3 April 2025, the company was ordered into judicial liquidation in relation to its creditors Unigrafica, Concita De Gregorio, and the representative of the public prosecutor's office.[94][95] The newspaper ceased publishing news in June 2025, while maintaining its activities on social networks.[96]
The Hollywood Reporter India was launched in 2024 in India. The Indian edition of The Hollywood Reporter has been launched under a licensing agreement between Penske Media Corporation and RPSG Lifestyle Media.[97][98] Anupama Chopra has been appointed as the Editor of The Hollywood Reporter India.[99]
The Hollywood Reporter En Español was launched in 2025 for Latin America and Spain.[100]
The Hollywood Reporter Germany was launched in October 2025, the magazine is edited by Grace Maier who previously served as the editor-in-chief of L'Officiel Liechenstein from 2021 to 2025.[101]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanna_Hamilton,Suzanna Hamilton,"
Suzanna Hamilton (born 12th September 1960) is an English actress, notable for playing the role of Julia in the 1984 film adaptation of George Orwell's classic novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, as well as other film roles including Tess (1979), Brimstone and Treacle (1982), Wetherby (1985), and Out of Africa (1985). She has had numerous television roles such as the ITV drama Wish Me Luck (1988), the BBC medical drama Casualty (1993–94), and the STV drama McCallum (1995–97).
Hamilton was born in London on September 12th 1960.[1] In 1973, Hamilton received acting training at the Anna Scher Theatre School in Islington.[2] She was a student at the Central School of Speech and Drama in Swiss Cottage, Camden.  She became a protégée of filmmaker Claude Whatham, who discovered her in a children's experimental theatre in North London in the early 1970s. 
In 1974, she appeared in her first feature film, the Whatham-directed Swallows and Amazons.[3] Billed as Zanna Hamilton, she was cast as Susan Walker, one of four young siblings collectively known as ""the Swallows"", who go on a camping and sailing holiday in the Lake District during the summer of 1929.[4]  Whatham later directed Hamilton as Princess Alice in the BBC miniseries, Disraeli (1978).[1]
For her first appearance in a big-budget film, Hamilton played Izz Huett, the lovesick dairymaid, in the Roman Polanski film Tess (1979), based on Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles, which starred Nastassja Kinski in the title role.[5] She also appeared as one of the boarding school girls who organise a strike against the Ministry of Education in The Wildcats of St. Trinian's (1980).[1]
Hamilton's next significant role was in the Richard Loncraine film Brimstone & Treacle (1982), based on Dennis Potter's play of the same name.[6] Hamilton starred as Patricia Bates, the traumatised, catatonic daughter of a devoutly religious, middle aged Home Counties couple (Denholm Elliott and Joan Plowright) whose lives are changed by a demonic drifter and con man who calls himself Martin Taylor, played by Sting.[7] The following year, Suzanna Hamilton was featured in BBC-TV's paranormal mystery, A Pattern of Roses, with Helena Bonham Carter.[1]
Hamilton was a member of the BBC's Radio Drama Company.[8]
Hamilton was cast as Julia opposite John Hurt as Winston Smith in the Michael Radford film Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984), based on the eponymous George Orwell dystopian novel.[9] She obtained the role through the casting agency of the Anna Scher Theatre School. She was one of the school's earliest alumni, and the theatre is acknowledged in the film's closing credits. This performance raised her profile as a film actress and attracted critical praise, particularly from Vincent Canby in The New York Times.[10]  However, her work was largely overshadowed by the death of fellow cast member Richard Burton, who delivered his final screen performance in the role of O'Brien, as well as by post-release controversy over the film's musical score.[11][12]
In 1985, Hamilton starred in British playwright David Hare's film Wetherby, opposite Vanessa Redgrave. Her next role was as Felicity in Sydney Pollack's Academy Award-winning Out of Africa, based on the memoirs of the Danish writer Isak Dinesen, and starring Meryl Streep, Robert Redford and Klaus Maria Brandauer.[13]
By the latter half of the decade, the majority of her screen roles were in obscure European films made in exotic locations as well as numerous British television dramas. In the 1986 German film, Devil's Paradise [de],[14] which was shot in Thailand and loosely based on Joseph Conrad's 1915 novel Victory, Hamilton was cast as a saxophonist in an all-woman band touring seedy hotels and nightclubs in Southeast Asia. Her character, Julie, escapes a life of sexual slavery by fleeing with an eccentric German adventurer, played by Jürgen Prochnow, and the two of them take refuge on an island near Indonesia, which is already populated by a savage native warrior tribe. Also in 1986, Hamilton starred in the well-received television drama Johnny Bull,[14] a film developed at the National Playwrights' Conference of the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center and filmed in Tennessee. In this film, a period piece set in the mid-1940s just after VE Day, she was cast as Iris Kovacs, a lighthearted Cockney bride who travels to rural Pennsylvania to live with her new American G.I. husband (Peter MacNicol) and his working class Hungarian-immigrant coal-mining family; Colleen Dewhurst and Kathy Bates starred in supporting roles. That same year, Hamilton appeared as Emily Barkstone in Hold the Dream,[13] the second of the three BBC miniseries based on Barbara Taylor Bradford's popular ""Emma Harte"" novels about the fortunes of a retail empire and the machinations of the business élite across three generations.
In 1987, she played the spirited but careless Anglo-French SOE spy, Matty Firman, in Wish Me Luck — an LWT miniseries, this one set in occupied France during World War II.[13] In 1988, she appeared opposite Jon Finch in another low-budget German film, a short called The Voice,[14] about six people who are held captive overnight on a floating discothèque. In 1989, she starred as the inscrutable femme fatale Anna Raven in the BBC miniseries of Never Come Back,[13] a noirish conspiracy thriller based on the celebrated 1941 novel by John Mair, which takes place on the eve of the London Blitz during the so-called ""Phoney War"" of 1939–40. Hamilton also acted in the 1990 British television film, Small Zones,[13] as a strong-willed Russian poet whose subversive writings have led to her indefinite imprisonment in a Soviet holding cell.
Suzanna Hamilton played the role of Regine Kleinschmidt in the TV movie Murder East, Murder West, set just before and just after the Fall of the Berlin Wall.[15]
In 1991, she appeared as Amelia, one of the five daughters placed under house arrest by their domineering mother, in the BBC adaptation of Spanish poet Federico García Lorca's play The House of Bernarda Alba;[14] Glenda Jackson starred in the title role. She also had a supporting role in a 1992 TV film of Barbara Cartland's Regency-period bodice-ripper, Duel of Hearts.[13]
Her next commercial film role was in a low-budget Gothic horror romance, Tale of a Vampire (1992), written and directed by a 27-year-old Anglo-Japanese film student, Shimako Satō[14]. Hamilton made a dual appearance: first as Anne, a librarian in present-day London grieving the untimely death of her boyfriend; then as Anne's 19th century doppelgänger, Virginia Clemm, the real-life wife of Edgar Allan Poe—who, in the film, also happens to be the long-lost mistress of a lonely, centuries-old vampire played by Julian Sands. In 1993, she had a recurring role as Dr. Karen Goodliffe on the British TV hospital drama series, Casualty. In 1995, she appeared as John Hannah's love interest, Joanna Sparks, on the ITV crime series, McCallum.[16]
In 1997, she appeared in The Island on Bird Street,[14] a Danish period drama made in the Dogme 95 style, about an 11-year-old Jewish boy who hides from the Nazis in occupied Poland during World War II before he is reunited with his father. In this film, Hamilton had a brief cameo as the mother of a girl whom the boy befriends.  More recently, she appeared as Vivienne in the 2005 short film, Benjamin's Struggle,[14] described as ""a compelling story set in 1930s Nazi Germany, about a nine-year-old Jewish boy who attempts to steal the original manuscript of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, believing that it will topple the Third Reich and end the suffering of his family"". In 2006, she appeared as Helen Gillespie in the ITV series, Jane Hall. In 2007, she appeared as Dr. Hillary Slayton in the children's television series, Dinosapien,[14] which is filmed on location in southern Alberta, Canada. In 2015 she played ""Barbara"" in the BBC drama Doctors[17] and in 2017 she played ""Sarah"" in the BBC series The Cuckoo's Calling.[18]
Hamilton is an accomplished theatre and radio actress. She made her first West End appearance on the London stage in 1982 as part of the original cast production of Tom Stoppard's play, The Real Thing.[19] In 1993, she played the lead as a Welsh maid in the Bush Theatre's production of Lucinda Coxon's Waiting at the Water's Edge;[20] in 2002, she was cast as Creusa in a Gate Theatre production of Euripides' Ion;[21] and in early 2005, she appeared as Dora, a woman incarcerated in a 1920s asylum in the Salisbury Playhouse's production of Charlotte Jones' chamber drama, Airswimming.[22] She also appeared in a 1991 audiobook recording of Julian Barnes' novel about a love triangle called Talking It Over and has been in many radio dramas. In May 2018 she played Shakespeare's Juliet (in old age) for The Theatre, Chipping Norton, in Ben Power's A Tender Thing[23][24] and in August 2019 she portrayed a Rhodesian estate owner in My One True Friend at the Tristan Bates Theatre, London.[25][26] In 2022 she performed at the Assembly George Square Studios in We Should Definitely Have More Dancing to critical acclaim.[27]
Hamilton spent a short time away from acting in major films to bring up her son but continued to feature in television roles and in theatre and voice work.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network),ITV (TV network),"
ITV, legally known as Channel 3, is a British free-to-air public broadcast television network. It is branded as ITV1 in most of the UK except for central and northern Scotland, where it is branded as STV. It was launched in 1955 as Independent Television to provide competition to BBC Television (established in 1936).[1] ITV is the oldest commercial network in the UK. Since the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990, it has been legally known as Channel 3 to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at the time: BBC1, BBC2 and Channel 4.
ITV was, for decades, a network of separate companies that provided regional television services and also shared programmes among themselves to be shown on the entire network. Each franchise was originally owned by a different company. After several mergers, the fifteen regional franchises are now held by two companies: ITV plc, which runs the ITV1 channel, and STV Group, which runs the STV channel.
The ITV network is a separate entity from ITV plc, the company that resulted from the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications in 2004. ITV plc holds the Channel 3 broadcasting licences for every region except for central and northern Scotland, which are held by STV Group.
Today, ITV plc simply commissions the network schedule centrally; programmes are made by its own subsidiary ITV Studios and independent production companies. Regional programming remains in news and some current affairs series.
Although the ITV network's history goes back to 1955, many regional franchisees changed over the years. Some of the most important names in the network's past—notably Thames, ABC and ATV—have no connection with the modern network.
The origins of ITV lie in the passing of the Television Act 1954, designed to break the monopoly on television held by the BBC Television Service.[1] The act created the Independent Television Authority (ITA, then IBA after the Sound Broadcasting Act) to heavily regulate the industry and to award franchises. The first six franchises were awarded in 1954 for London, the Midlands and the North of England, with separate franchises for Weekdays and Weekends.[1] The first ITV service to launch was London's Associated-Rediffusion on 22 September 1955,[2] with the Midlands and North services launching in February 1956 and May 1956 respectively. Following these launches, the ITA awarded more franchises until the whole country was covered by fourteen regional stations, all launched by 1962.
The network has been modified several times through franchise reviews that have taken place in 1963,[3] 1967,[4] 1974,[5] 1980[6][7] and 1991,[8] during which broadcast regions have changed and service operators have been replaced. Only one service operator has ever been declared bankrupt, WWN in 1963,[9] with all other operators leaving the network as a result of a franchise review. Separate weekend franchises were removed in 1968 (with the exception of London)[3] and over the years more services were added; these included a national breakfast franchise from 1983 onward—operating between 6:00 am and 9:25 am—and a teletext service.[6] The Broadcasting Act 1990 changed the nature of ITV; the then regulator the IBA was replaced with a light-touch regulator, the ITC; companies became able to purchase other ITV regional companies[10] and franchises were now being awarded based upon a highest-bidder auction, with few safeguards in place.[8] This heavily criticised part of the review saw four operators replaced, and the operators facing different annual payments to the Treasury: Central Independent Television, for example, paid only £2,000—despite holding a lucrative and large region—because it was unopposed, while Yorkshire Television paid £37.7 million for a region of the same size and status, owing to heavy competition.[8][11]
Following the 1993 changes, ITV as a network began to consolidate with several companies doing so to save money by ceasing the duplication of services present when they were all separate companies. By 2004, the ITV network was owned by five companies, of which two, Carlton and Granada, had become major players by owning between them all the franchises in England, Wales, the Scottish borders and the Isle of Man.[12][13][14] That same year, the two merged to form ITV plc[12][13][14] with the only subsequent acquisitions being the takeover of Channel Television, the Channel Islands franchise, in 2011;[15] and UTV, the franchise for ITV in Northern Ireland, in 2015.
The ITV network is not owned or operated by one company, but by a number of licensees, which provide regional services while also broadcasting programmes across the network. Since 2016, the fifteen licences are held by two companies, with the majority held by ITV Broadcasting Limited, part of ITV plc.
The network is regulated by the media regulator Ofcom which is responsible for awarding the broadcast licences. The last major review of the Channel 3 franchises was in 1991, with all operators' licences having been renewed between 1999 and 2002 and again from 2014 without a further contest. While this has been the longest period that the ITV network has gone without a major review of its licence holders, Ofcom announced (following consultation) that it would split the Wales and West licence from 1 January 2014, creating a national licence for Wales and joining the newly separated West region to Westcountry Television, to form a new licence for the enlarged South West of England region.
All companies holding a licence were part of the non-profit body ITV Network Limited, which commissioned and scheduled network programming, with compliance previously handled by ITV plc and Channel Television. However, due to amalgamation of several of these companies since the creation of ITV Network Limited (and given Channel Television is now owned by ITV plc), it has been replaced by an affiliation system.[16] Approved by Ofcom, this results in ITV plc commissioning and funding the network schedule, with STV and UTV paying a fee to broadcast it.[16] All licensees have the right to opt out of network programming (except for the national news bulletins), but, unlike the previous system, will receive no fee refund for doing so. Therefore many do not opt out due to pressures from the parent company or because of limited resources.[16] Prior to the affiliate system being introduced, STV would frequently (and sometimes controversially) opt out of several popular network programmes – such as the original run of the first series of Downton Abbey – citing the need to provide more Scottish content to its viewers.[17]
As a public service broadcaster, the ITV network is obliged to broadcast programming of public importance, including news, current affairs, children's and religious programming as well as party election broadcasts on behalf of the major political parties and political events, such as the Budget. The network also needs to produce accessible output containing subtitles, signing and audio description. In exchange for this programming, the ITV network is available on all platforms free to air and can be found at the top of the EPG of all providers.
Since the launch of the platform in 1998, all of the ITV licensees have received gifted capacity on the digital terrestrial television platform. At present, the companies are able to broadcast additional channels and all choose to broadcast the ITV plc owned ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and ITV Quiz in their region.[citation needed] UTV and STV (formerly Scottish Television and Grampian Television) previously broadcast their own services – UTV2 in Northern Ireland and S2 in central and northern Scotland – until 2002, when they adopted the ITV plc channels. Despite this, STV was given a broadcasting licence for what would become the STV2 channel in 2013, however this was short-lived and the channel closed in 2018. The broadcasters all make use of the Digital 3&4 multiplex, shared with Channel 4. CITV launched in March 2006 (closed September 2023). ITV Encore launched in June 2014 (closed May 2018) and ITVBe launched in October 2014. ITV Box Office launched in February 2017 (closed January 2020).
On 13 September 2022,[18] ITV confirmed that during the day of Monday 19 September, the day of the state funeral for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, all programming schedules on ITV's digital channels would be scrapped, with the main ITV News coverage being shown live and uninterrupted on every channel.[19][18] This was the first time ITV decided to do this, with the company keeping their digital channels' schedules mostly as advertised in the run up to the funeral (with a few amendments for cancelled sporting events on ITV4) and all royal coverage being on their main channel.[19][20][21][22][23][24]
ITV plc owns thirteen of the fifteen franchises and broadcasts to England, Wales, southern Scotland, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and Northern Ireland through its subsidiary company ITV Broadcasting Limited.[15] The company also owns the breakfast television licence,[25] which as of January 2020, broadcasts across the network between 6:00 and 10:00am each morning using the Good Morning Britain (previously Daybreak) and Lorraine names. The company broadcasts a centralised service under the ITV1 brand. In Northern Ireland, ITV used the UTV brand name as the name of the channel until April 2020.[26]
The group also owns ITV Studios, the production arm of the company and formed from an amalgamation of all the production departments of the regional licences they own. The company produces a large proportion of ITV's networked programming (around 47%, but previously as high as 66% according to some reports[27]), with the rest coming primarily from independent suppliers (under the Broadcasting Act 1990, at least 25% of ITV's total output must be from independent companies).[28] ITV plc hopes to increase the amount of in-house programming to as close to the 75% limit as possible.
The group cut the number of regional news programmes offered from 17 in 2007 to 9 by 2009, resulting several regions being merged to form one programme, including the Border and Tyne Tees regions, the Westcountry and West regions and the removal of sub regional programming, with some regions only represented by pre-recorded segments.[29] Sub-regions were restored in 2013.
STV Group plc owns two franchises, covering central and northern Scotland, through subsidiary companies STV Central and STV North, broadcasting a central service under the STV brand.
The company had several disputes with ITV plc in the late 2000s and early 2010s over network programming. STV aimed to broadcast more Scottish programmes at peak times and so removed several key ITV plc programmes from their schedule in July 2009 including The Bill, Midsomer Murders and Lewis.[30] Despite STV's explanation of expense, ITV plc were angered by the decision, as a recent schedule change had made The Bill central to their programming, and broadcast the programmes on ITV3 as well to ensure Scottish viewers could see the programmes. On 23 September ITV plc was reported to be in the process of suing STV for £20 million, as ITV felt dropping the shows constituted a breach of network agreements;[31] STV subsequently counter-sued ITV plc for £35 million.
The dispute was ended in 2011 with STV agreeing to pay ITV plc £18 million. The signing of the new affiliation deal has resulted in STV paying a flat fee for all networked programming, and so to drop any programmes is unlikely due to the large costs involved.[32]
There are fifteen regional licences, covering fourteen regions (there are separate weekday and weekend licences for the London region), and one national licence for the breakfast service. All licences listed here were renewed until the end of 2024. Licences in England and Wales were held by the individual regional ITV plc owned companies prior to November 2008.[33]
The appointment to provide national news for Channel 3 is also subject to approval by Ofcom. This appointment has been held by ITN since the channel's inception, and has also been approved through the end of 2024.[34]
For over 60 years of ITV, its homegrown programmes have become among the best remembered as well as being extremely successful. Before the 1990s, nearly all of the content for the channel was produced by the fifteen franchise licensees: the regional companies.
However, following legislation in the Broadcasting Act 1990 imposing a 25% quota for commissioning of independent productions,[28] the number of programmes from independent production companies not connected to the traditional ITV network has increased rapidly. Notable examples include Talkback Thames (one half of which, Thames Television, was itself a former ITV franchisee), producers of The Bill and co-producers of The X Factor, and 2waytraffic, producers of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.
From the late 1990s, ITV's long-standing commitment to strong current affairs and documentary programming began to diminish with the ending of productions such as World in Action (Granada Television), This Week (Rediffusion London/Thames Television), First Tuesday (Yorkshire Television), Network First, Survival (Anglia Television), and Weekend World (LWT) and their replacement with populist shows such as Tonight. News at Ten was also axed in 1999, although it was reinstated in 2001. In December 2009, the final edition of ITV's long-running arts programme, The South Bank Show was broadcast.
ITV's primetime schedules are dominated by its soap operas, such as the flagship Coronation Street and Emmerdale. At the start of the 21st century, ITV faced criticism for including a large amount of ""reality TV"" programmes in the schedule, such as Celebrity Fit Club, Celebrity Wrestling and Celebrity Love Island. In its defence[editorializing], ITV does continue to show its major strengths in the fields of sports coverage and drama productions, and it continues to schedule national news in primetime.
Breakfast television programmes have been broadcast on ITV since 1 February 1983. It was initially run by an independent contractor - TV-am, and later GMTV - until GMTV Limited became a wholly owned subsidiary of ITV plc in November 2009.[37]
Historically, ITV aired breakfast programmes from 6am until 9.25am but ITV extended this to 10am on weekdays on 6 January 2020.[38] and now broadcasts two breakfast programmes on weekdays - Good Morning Britain and Lorraine. Good Morning Britain keeps viewers up to date with all the latest news, sports, features and weather, whilst Lorraine predominantly focuses on celebrity interviews, recipes, fashion and showbiz. Until 27th August 2023, the service would show a simulcast of the CITV channel, but since that service has closed, a mix of repeated programming is shown whilst the CITV service that still exist broadcasts at breakfast time on ITV2 (which has the CITV block), ITV3, ITV4 and ITVBe from 7am show other repeats some of which provide a sign language service within the broadcast as part of its quota and licence requirements.
ITV's strong daytime line-up helped by programmes such as This Morning, Loose Women, Dickinson's Real Deal and game shows Tipping Point and The Chase are very popular, achieving the highest audience share during the daytime slot.[39]
In recent years the network has tried to use formats that ITV Studios own outright (whether they have originated in the UK with their Lifted Entertainment[40] company or have come from production companies they own abroad), though some popular programme formats like The Masked Singer have still been acquired from other companies abroad. Currently ITV are behind the formats for Dancing on Ice, The Voice UK (the format originally coming from their Dutch production company) and I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, while forthcoming music game show Walk The Line has been co-developed by Simon Cowell's Syco Entertainment and ITV.[41][42][43][44]
Since the network started, Independent Television News Limited (ITN) has held the contract to produce news for the ITV network, with 30-minute national news bulletins currently broadcast at 1:30 pm, and 10:00 pm, and an hour-long bulletin at 6.30pm. These bulletins were broadcast under the ITN brand from 1955 until 1999, when a new network identity reinforced the ITV brand, resulting in the new bulletins being broadcast under the ITV News brand.[45][46]
ITN has long been respected in the news industry as a source of reliable information and news, and as a result the service has won many awards for their programmes, the latest being in May 2011 when News at Ten was named best news programme by the Royal Television Society and BAFTA.
The ITV National Weather forecast was first broadcast in 1989, using data supplied by the Met Office, and was presented by a number of weather forecasters. The forecasts are sponsored with the sponsor's message appearing before and after the forecast. The forecasts are made immediately after the main national news bulletins.
Prior to the creation of the national forecast, each regional company provided its own regional forecast. The regional forecasts today are incorporated into the main regional news bulletins, and in the summer months, includes a pollen count.
Currently only new episodes of long-form news and current affairs programmes like Exposure,[47] Peston[48] and On Assignment[49] are being scheduled after News at Ten. The channel broadcasts a partnership teleshopping service overnight, replacing gambling broadcasts: the time between the news and the shopping is usually kept for re-runs, with ITV repeating its primetime entertainment shows, films, or sports programming from ITV4.[50][51][52][53]
Also aired overnight are [54] repeats, many of which have on-screen BSL signing for the deaf community.[55] Replacing the information-based ITV Nightscreen slot in 2021 was Unwind With ITV,[56] programming produced in association with the Campaign Against Living Miserably. This mindfulness programme shows calming shots of natural landscapes and relaxing animations,[57][58] with versions of the footage also seen on ITV2, ITV3 and ITV4.
On some occasions the schedule is varied, for example a live event overnight, such as the Super Bowl or the Oscars.[59][60]
This overnight programme service is very different to what used to be shown on the network in the years after 24-hour broadcasting was introduced - this included new entertainment, imports, sports and other information programmes, and, in some regions, a job finder service.
The regional ITV companies are required to provide local news as part of their franchise agreement together with local weather forecasts, with the main local bulletin at 6pm and regional bulletins located after each national news programme. In addition to this, traditionally ITV companies would provide other regional programming based on current affairs, entertainment or drama. However, apart from a monthly political programme, most non-news regional programming in the English regions was dropped by ITV plc in 2009, although it continues in Wales and the Channel Islands, as well as on STV and UTV and ITV Border in Scotland from 2014 to cover mainly Scottish politics whilst ITV Border in England broadcast network programming .[61] On 14 January 2013, ITV plc regional news programmes titles were discontinued in favour of more generic branding under the ITV News title with the region listed as the subheading. However some ""heritage"" brand names were retained including Calendar, Granada Reports and Lookaround. On 28 June 2014, ITV News Cymru Wales returned to its historic name of Wales at Six.
The network broadcasts children's programming under the CITV (Children's ITV) strand. Children's programming was originally provided during weekday afternoons and weekend mornings, however following the launch of the CITV channel in 2006, all children's programming, with the exception of the weekend ITV Breakfast slot, were relocated from the ITV line-up to the CITV channel in 2007, a move which was challenged by Ofcom in April 2007. In 2023, ITV announced that CITV would cease broadcasting as a linear channel, and would be replaced by ITVX Kids, a streaming media service which launched in July 2023.[72]  The CITV channel closed on 1 September 2023, with a dedicated CITV programming block now broadcasting on ITV2 every morning, from 2 September 2023.
Schools programming on the network began in 1957 in some regions and expanded as more regions began broadcasting. It was a contractual obligation for some ITV companies to broadcast schools programming, and this was initially broadcast as part of the normal scheduling. The programmes were moved into a segment for broadcast during the day in the 1960s, under the banner Independent Television for Schools and Colleges and from 1987 were broadcast on Channel 4 in the ITV Schools on Channel 4 segment. In 1993, this segment became Channel 4 Schools and later in 2000 4Learning. These strands of programming consisted of schools programming from all the ITV companies or from independent sources. The schools strand itself is now defunct, with no particular branding segment used.
ITV was originally very reliant on broadcasting American series, with westerns such as Gunsmoke and Rawhide in particular being considerable successes for the network during its earlier years. Action drama The Fugitive and sci-fi anthology The Twilight Zone were also broadcast by various regions in the early 1960s, with Batman and I Dream of Jeannie shown later on in the decade. Due to the varying schedules of many ITV regions, acquired content was not broadcast by some franchises.
By the 1970s, most ITV regions were airing the likes of Hawaii Five-O, Happy Days, and The Brady Bunch. 1972 also saw the beginning of ITV's daytime programmes at lunchtime, a slot that would become associated with the many Australian soap operas that were broadcast in the newly expanded schedule, including The Sullivans and The Young Doctors. By the 1980s, more were added to the schedule, such as Sons and Daughters and A Country Practice.
In primetime by the 1980s, ITV was broadcasting the likes of Hill Street Blues (which ITV began showing just one week after its debut on NBC in the United States) and L.A. Law. It was also early in the decade when Australian evening soap opera Prisoner: Cell Block H was bought by ITV, and was broadcast after News at Ten.
By 1982, Channel 4 had launched, and despite originally being related to ITV, it competed against its parent network to screen popular American programmes such as St. Elsewhere and Cheers, although the latter did receive a single ITV broadcast as part of a night showcasing Channel 4 programmes. Both Hill Street Blues and L.A. Law had moved from ITV to Channel 4 by the end of their runs.
A heavy emphasis on action, fantasy and science fiction series was also placed by ITV during the 1980s, with The A-Team, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, and Airwolf being broadcast by the network, as well as the likes of Baywatch and SeaQuest DSV by the 1990s. ITV also picked up a glut of older-skewing CBS dramas through that period, including Murder, She Wrote and Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. 
In February 1989, in tandem with the network launching its national weather forecast, and as part of a new early evening lineup which involved the shortening of Children's ITV, Australian soap Home and Away was acquired by ITV, particularly to compete with the success of rival Australian soap opera Neighbours on BBC One. ITV also broadcast Beverly Hills, 90210 beginning in early 1991, in the same Saturday teatime slot that Baywatch had occupied, although some episodes were broadcast in later time slots. It moved to Sky One beginning with the third season. 
ITV reshuffled its daytime schedules in the autumn of 1993, and just a few months prior, Central began broadcasting the New Zealand soap opera Shortland Street. The revamp saw more ITV companies pick it up, with Scottish Television the only region to reject the series outright. Central also broadcast the Australian soap opera Echo Point around the same time, although no other franchises picked it up. ITV also aired a considerable amount of syndicated unscripted US programmes in daytime during the 90s, such as Judge Judy and The Jerry Springer Show.
By 1996, ITV had been quiet with US series in primetime, particularly as Channel 4 and Sky One increased the competition for securing the most popular US dramas and sitcoms. However, that summer, ITV debuted the primetime soap Savannah, in a 9pm Friday slot. It was a considerable success for ITV's standards, and it became the highest rated new American series of that year. Despite this success, ITV moved the show for its second season, no longer networking the series and moving to late night slots.
ITV tried again at broadcasting an American drama series in September 1997, with the ABC legal drama The Practice, which ran in the same slot that Savannah had the year prior. It saw nowhere near the same levels of success, and was dropped by the network after just three episodes. It later resurfaced in late night before moving to BBC One in 2000.
ITV attempted launching a Monday night block for American sitcoms in the post-News at Ten slot in the autumn of 1998, with Veronica's Closet (which ITV beat Channel 4 for the rights to) followed by Dharma & Greg.[73] After this failed to catch much steam, ITV all but pulled out from showing American programmes on the main network by the end of the decade, and it would prove to be the final time ITV aired US comedy on the main network.
ITV made attempts during the mid 2000s to poach proven popular US shows such as the mystery comedy-drama Desperate Housewives and medical drama House from Channel 4 and Five, respectively, but both shows ended up remaining on their incumbent rights holders.[74][75] ITV were reportedly also interested in 2004 about acquiring the Friends spin-off Joey but later denied such interest, and in 2007 were close to picking up Neighbours after the BBC declined to continue broadcasting it, although Five eventually won the rights to both programmes.[76][77][78]
ITV returned to US programming in 2006, acquiring Six Degrees.[79] Initially it had been planned to air in a primetime slot in 2007, but ended up being shown in late nights in 2008. This could be due to the show being cancelled after its first season by original network ABC due to low ratings, despite high expectations and its slot following top-10 hit Grey's Anatomy. It was also around this time that Supernatural and Dexter, which ITV2 & ITV4 aired respectively, were given late night repeats on ITV1.[80][81]
The following year, ITV acquired another US programme, fellow ABC series Pushing Daisies. It debuted in 2008 in a Saturday evening slot and initially did well garnering 5.7 million viewers, although there were fan complaints when ITV chose to skip broadcasting the second episode, blaming football coverage, eventually releasing it on their website.[82][83] The last attempt so far by ITV to broadcast acquired output in primetime was the TV adaption of Lethal Weapon in 2017, where it remained for all three seasons.
As of 2024, most US acquired programming that ITV owns the UK rights to, such as Family Guy, Bob's Burgers, The O.C., Dawson's Creek, Gilmore Girls and Superstore air on ITV2, as opposed to the main ITV network.[citation needed]
The Public Teletext Licence[84] allows the holder to broadcast a text-based information service around the clock on Channel 3 (as well as Channel 4 and S4C) frequencies. Teletext on ITV was provided by ORACLE from 1974 until 1993 and from 1993 to 2010 by Teletext Ltd., whose news, sport and TV listings pages rivalled the BBC's offering, Ceefax on terrestrial and BBC Red Button on digital. Teletext Ltd. also provided digital teletext for the Channel 3 services, as well as the text output for both Channel 4 and S4C under the same licence and Channel 5. However, the licence was revoked by Ofcom on 29 January 2010 for failing to provide news and local non-news information on ITV and there is currently no teletext licence holder for ITV.[85]
ITV (as UTV) is widely available in Ireland, where it is received directly in areas bordering Northern Ireland, or in coastal areas from Wales (as ITV Cymru Wales). Until 2015, it was also carried on cable, when it was replaced by UTV Ireland, which was itself replaced by be3, now Virgin Media Three. ITV programming is also available to Irish viewers on Virgin Media One (including soap operas Emmerdale and Coronation Street). ITV is also available on cable and IPTV in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Since 27 March 2013, it has been offered by the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) to members of HM Forces and their families around the world, replacing the BFBS3 TV channel, which already carried a selection of ITV programmes.[86]
Since the launch of ITV, there have been concerns from politicians and the press that ITV faced a conflict concerning programme audiences and advertisers. As advertisers are reluctant to buy advertising space around low viewing programmes, there is a pressure on ITV to broadcast more popular programmes in peak times.[citation needed] This became more profound in the early 21st century, following a relaxation in regulation and significantly more competition in the advertising market following the huge increase in commercial channels.[citation needed] In the 2000s, programmes from the reality television genre including the celebrity and talent show subgenres became a dominant presence on the channel. This led to accusations of ITV 'dumbing down' their programmes and appealing to the 'lowest common denominator', accusations that are at odds with the network's status as a public service broadcaster.[87][88] ITV was/is also heavily criticized for scaling back its regional programmes, including regional news.[citation needed]
There has never been an identity for ITV as a whole that was adopted uniformly by all broadcasters within the ITV network. Before 1989, each regional company used its own name for identification and the name ""ITV"" was rarely seen on screen, except for some sub-brands such as ITV Schools or ITV Sport. In September 1989, a national ITV corporate identity was established, which saw regional brands combined with the national ITV brand, although the balance between regional and national brands varied from company to company, and some companies never used the ITV brand at all. It was not until October 2002 that national ITV-branded continuity was adopted across all the regions in England and Wales (see ITV1), although regional continuity before local programmes continued until November 2006.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freema_Agyeman,Freema Agyeman,"
Freema Agyeman (/ˈfriːmə ˈædʒɪmən/;[1] born Frema Agyeman; 20 March 1979)[2] is an English actress. She rose to fame with her role as the Doctor's companion Martha Jones in the BBC science fiction series Doctor Who (2007–2010) and its spin-off Torchwood (2008), and received further recognition for playing Crown Prosecutor Alesha Phillips in the ITV crime procedural Law & Order: UK (2009–2012), Amanita Caplan in the Netflix science fiction drama Sense8 (2015–2018) and Dr. Helen Sharpe in the NBC medical drama New Amsterdam (2018–2023).
Following her departure from Doctor Who, Agyeman reprised her role as Martha Jones in the Doctor Who spin-off series Torchwood and had a part as Tattycoram in the BBC period miniseries Little Dorrit (both 2008). In 2013, she made her US television debut in The CW's Sex and the City prequel series, The Carrie Diaries, as magazine editor Larissa Loughlin.
Her other television appearances include Mile High (2005), Bizarre ER (2008), and Dreamland (2023). Agyeman has also appeared in films, including North v South (2015), Eat Locals (2017), and The Matrix Resurrections (2021).
Agyeman was born in Hackney, East London on 20 March 1979. Her mother, Azar Azizian-Kohan, born in 1948, is Iranian Kurdish, and her father, Osei Agyeman, is Ghanaian. They divorced when she was young. Agyeman has an older sister, Leila, and a younger brother, Dominic.[3]
Although her mother was raised as a Muslim and her father was raised as a Methodist, Agyeman grew up to be a practising Roman Catholic.[4] Agyeman attended Our Lady's Convent RC High School, a Catholic school in Stamford Hill. Later, during the summer of 1996, she attended the Anna Scher Theatre School in Islington, North London, and studied performing arts and drama at Middlesex University, graduating in 2000.[3] She also took a theatrical course at Radford University in Virginia in 1998, even volunteering to work as a box-office assistant for student drama productions in which she was not cast.[5][6]
When Agyeman began her professional acting career, she chose to use a different spelling of her birth name, Frema, as her professional name, to avoid pronunciation problems.[7]
Before securing the part of Martha Jones in Doctor Who, Agyeman's most famous television role was playing Lola Wise in the revived series of the ITV soap opera Crossroads. For her performance, she was nominated in two categories, Best Newcomer and Sexiest Female, at the 2003 British Soap Awards.[8] Agyeman also had small guest roles in such TV series as BBC's long-running medical drama Casualty, Sky One's airline drama Mile High and ITV's police procedural The Bill, in which she appeared twice as two separate characters. In 2005, she played Mary Ogden, a scene of crime officer, in an episode of Silent Witness.
Agyeman made her feature film debut in 2006, playing Nana in the independent drama Rulers and Dealers (2006), written and directed by Stephen Lloyd Jackson.[9]
When we cast the character of Adeola, I met Freema [Agyeman] for this part – actually, I met her for two parts – and when I met her, as soon as she walked through the door, I knew she was going to be quite exceptional. When she walked in, I thought I was looking at Halle Berry English-style...
Agyeman auditioned for three roles in the 2006 series of Doctor Who. On 24 June 2005, she auditioned for the part of Sally Jacobs in ""The Christmas Invasion"", but the role went to Anita Briem, who better fitted the production team's concept of the character as an ""ice cool blonde"".[11] Agyeman later auditioned for the roles of Esme and Adeola Oshodi, in the ""Rise of the Cybermen""/""The Age of Steel"" and ""Army of Ghosts"", respectively. Esme was ultimately cut from the final script,[12] but Agyeman was successful in her audition for Adeola. She filmed her role in the series in December 2005[citation needed] and appeared on screen as Adeola on 1 July 2006. Agyeman studied dance and practised horse riding, martial arts and gymnastics, a fact that the producers exploited to provide her with more physically arduous action scenes.[13]
The production team was impressed by the versatility shown by Agyeman across her three auditions and called her back as a serious candidate for the new companion. She attended another audition (ostensibly for an episode of Torchwood)[11] before a final screen test with Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant. Tennant left a reassuring note under the door of Agyeman's hotel room, and this helped calm any nerves the actress had.[14] Following extensive speculation on who would replace Billie Piper, Agyeman was confirmed to the press as new companion Martha Jones on 5 July 2006.[15]
Agyeman began filming for the third series in August 2006 and finished in March 2007. She made her screen debut as medical student Martha on 31 March 2007 in the episode ""Smith and Jones"".[16] A line of dialogue explains that Adeola was Martha's cousin. Agyeman continued to portray the character throughout every episode of the series. In the series finale, ""Last of the Time Lords"", Martha left the Doctor of her own accord after recognising how unhealthy their relationship had become, but promised that she would see him again. Agyeman also voiced the character in the animated serial The Infinite Quest, which aired in twelve weekly segments during the run of the 2007 series.
In 2007, Agyeman's performance as Martha was praised at several award ceremonies. In June, she was named Best Newcomer at Glamour's Women of the Year Awards.[17] In October, she won the People's Choice category for Favourite Female TV Star at the 5th Screen Nation Film & TV Awards and became one of the top four nominees for Most Popular Actress at the 13th National Television Awards.[18] The role also got her nominations in the Best Actress categories at the TV Quick Awards and the Golden Nymph Awards.[19] In December, The Observer had an interview with Agyeman and named her as one of their Faces of 2007.[20]
The following year, Agyeman returned as Martha in five episodes of the fourth series of the show. Following the series finale, Agyeman stated that she would be open to reprising the role.[21] She later returned to the series along with several other former cast members to mark David Tennant's final appearance in ""The End of Time"". Concurrent with her appearance on the show, Agyeman read abridged audiobook adaptations of five of the Doctor Who New Series Adventures novels featuring Martha, namely The Last Dodo,[22] Wetworld,[23] The Pirate Loop,[24] Martha in the Mirror[25] and The Story of Martha.[26]
I'd like to think that there will be more for Martha Jones, because Doctor Who has been one of the biggest experiences of my life, both in terms of my career and in terms of how it has changed my life over the last two years. I dare say a great number of people will always associate me with Martha, and that really makes me smile. It means that she lives on. That's so flattering. It's an honour. I'd love to do more with her, definitely...
In between the third and fourth series of Doctor Who, Agyeman appeared in three episodes of the show's spin-off drama Torchwood,[27] namely ""Reset"", ""Dead Man Walking"" and ""A Day in the Death"". She also had a starring role in the Torchwood radio play ""Lost Souls"", broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 10 September 2008 to promote the activation of the Large Hadron Collider at the CERN research facility on that same day.[28] It was later revealed by director Euros Lyn that the production team had intended for Agyeman to also appear in the third series of Torchwood, but she was already committed to Law & Order: UK.[29]
In February 2020, she reprised her role as Martha in the Torchwood audio drama ""Dissected"", produced by Big Finish Productions.[30] In July 2021, a new three-part audio series starring Agyeman was announced, The Year of Martha Jones. It was released in December and depicted Martha during the year she spent travelling the Earth in the third series finale of Doctor Who.[31]
Agyeman appeared several times on The Bedtime Hour on CBeebies, reading the story broadcast shortly before 7.00 pm. She narrated the first series of BBC Three's hospital documentary series Bizarre ER, which ran from 14 February[32] to 3 April 2008 and[33] also provided the narration for a second series which began airing on 21 April 2009.[34] Agyeman hosted a Doctor Who-themed portion of the BBC Proms on 27 July.[35] A one-hour cut-down version of the prom made its TV debut on BBC One, New Year's Day, 2009.
Agyeman played foundling girl Tattycoram in the Emmy Award-winning 2008 BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens's Little Dorrit, which began on 26 October 2008, starring alongside her fellow Torchwood co-stars Eve Myles and Ruth Jones.[36] Some of Agyeman's scenes for the first episode were shot in the grounds of Deal Castle, Kent, which doubled for Marseille, France.[37] Agyeman was delighted to have appeared in Little Dorrit, as it had always been a dream of hers to appear in a period drama.[38] In 2008, Agyeman also appeared in Survivors, a BBC One remake of the cult 1970s TV series, as Jenny Walsh (surname was originally reported to be Collins), although her character was killed off in the first episode in a shock twist despite featuring prominently in promotional materials for the series.[39][40]
Between 2009 and 2012, Agyeman appeared as Crown Prosecutor Alesha Phillips in Law & Order: UK, a UK adaptation and spin-off from the US Law & Order franchise.[41][42] Agyeman is a self-professed ""massive fan"" of the original Law & Order series, especially the third and fourth seasons. In preparation for the role, Agyeman sat in on live trials, toured the Old Bailey, and conferred with her law-degree-holding sister, Leila: ""She's great and really patient at explaining things to laymen, because I was coming at it completely blind. She's been a good source.""[43] She remained with the programme for its first six series departing the cast before the seventh series due to other filming commitments.[44] For her role as Alesha Phillips, Agyeman was longlisted for the National Television Awards for Outstanding Drama Performance several times.[45] She was also nominated for Best UK Actress at the 2009 Birmingham Black International Film Festival's Music, Video and Screen Awards.[46]
In March 2012, it was announced that Agyeman would play Larissa, ""an easy-going party girl who works at Interview magazine"" in the pilot of the Sex and the City prequel The Carrie Diaries (2013–2014).[47] In early 2013, she starred in the CBeebies television series Old Jack's Boat as Shelley.[48]
I think having the opportunity to play [Amanita] has probably been the most significant moment in my career. To play this queer, cisgendered, urban hippy who is an active campaigner for freedom to love. And to just be so free in her own skin and revel in her sexuality, and celebrate life and love and the flesh. I mean, I am truly going to miss the strength of that character and inhabiting her.
In 2015, Agyeman appeared in the Netflix series Sense8 (2015–2018), created by J. Michael Straczynski and Lilly and Lana Wachowski.[50][51] She played series regular Amanita Caplan, the girlfriend of Nomi, a trans woman blogger and hacktivist.[52][49] In the same year, she starred as Penny, a woman embroiled in a crime war between northern and southern UK gangs, in the film North v South.[53] The film was poorly received by critics, but earned Agyeman nominations at both the Screen Nation Film & TV Awards and the National Film Awards.[54][55] Her other film appearances include the role of Angel in the vampire film Eat Locals (2017), co-starring Charlie Cox, and a small part as Astra in the science fiction blockbuster The Matrix Resurrections (2021).[56]
In 2018, Agyeman became a member of the main cast of the NBC medical drama series New Amsterdam, playing the role of Dr. Helen Sharpe, the head of the oncology and hematology department. In July 2022, she announced that she would not be returning to New Amsterdam for its fifth and final season,[57] instead signing up for Sky Max's comedy-drama Dreamland, which also featured singer Lily Allen in her first television lead role.[58]
The tattoo Agyeman has on her upper arm is symbolic of her Iranian ancestry, containing the Persian/Iranian word ""raha"", meaning ""free"", under an image of a butterfly.[59]
Agyeman is a non-church-going Roman Catholic. She has stated that doing good is her way of believing in God and expressing Catholic Christianity.[60]
After working in the United States for a number of years, Agyeman returned to England upon exiting New Amsterdam.[61][62]

Robert Lewis Glenister (born 11 March 1960) is an English actor. He is best known for his television roles as Ash ""Three Socks"" Morgan in the crime drama series Hustle (2004–2012) and Nicholas Blake in the spy drama series Spooks (2006–2010).
Glenister was born in Watford on 11 March 1960.[1] He is the son of Joan Fry Lewis and television director John Glenister, and the older brother of actor Philip Glenister. Until the age of eight he had a slight speech impediment. After starting school, he began to show a talent for acting. He decided to pursue a professional acting career after being encouraged by his father and leaving Harrow Weald Grammar School. He started his career by taking several theatre roles.[2]
Glenister made his television debut in the BBC sitcom Sink or Swim, which ran from 1980 until 1982.[3] He has also appeared in shows such as Soldier Soldier,[4] Only Fools and Horses (as Myles the millionaire garden centre owner and chairman of the SWANS committee),[5] A Touch of Frost[6] and Inspector George Gently[7] as well as several films.
He had a starring role in the BBC drama Hustle as Ash Morgan, a high-level con-man who has to convincingly play various roles or characters to pull off a con and lure a 'mark'. He is the only actor who has appeared in every episode of the series. He has also had regular starring roles in the BBC drama Spooks and appeared in Spartacus.[8][9] He appeared as an Irish-American mob boss in Ben Affleck's crime drama Live by Night, which was released in December 2016.[10] He has been cast twice in Doctor Who, playing Salateen in The Caves of Androzani (1984) (opposite his Sink or Swim co-star Peter Davison) and Thomas Edison in ""Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror"" (2020).[11]
In June 2022 he appeared as Detective Inspector Salisbury in Sherwood, a BBC serial written by James Graham.[12] In 2024, he plays Tony, a cab driver in the Channel 5 thriller series The Night Caller.[13]
Glenister married actor Amanda Redman in 1984; the couple had a daughter before they divorced in 1992.[14] He later married BBC Radio producer and director Celia de Wolff, with whom he has a son.[15]
In April 2019, it was reported that lawyers acting for a company owned by Glenister – Big Bad Wolff – had lost an appeal in a long-running battle with HM Revenue and Customs regarding liability for National Insurance contributions.[16] Glenister subsequently said that he would have to sell or remortgage his house as a result of the ruling, since he now faced a bill of £147,000 plus interest.[17]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion,Abortion,"
Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus.[nb 1][2]  The unmodified word abortion generally refers to induced abortion,[3][4] or deliberate actions to end a pregnancy.[nb 2] Abortion occurring without intervention is known as spontaneous abortion or ""miscarriage"", and occurs in roughly 30–40% of all pregnancies.[5][6] Common reasons for inducing an abortion are birth-timing and limiting family size.[7][8][9] Other reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feelings of being too young, wishing to complete an education or advance a career, and not being able, or willing, to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.[7][9][10]
When done legally in industrialized societies, induced abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine.[11]: 1 [12] Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions.[13] The drug mifepristone (aka RU-486) in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.[13][14] Self-managed medication abortion is highly effective and safe throughout the first trimester.[15][16][17] The most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using a suction device.[18] Birth control, such as the pill or intrauterine devices, can be used immediately following an abortion.[14] When performed legally and safely on a woman who desires it, an induced abortion does not increase the risk of long-term mental or physical problems.[19] In contrast, unsafe abortions performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities cause between 22,000 and 44,000 deaths and 6.9 million hospital admissions each year[20]—responsible for between 5% and 13% of maternal deaths, especially in low income countries.[21] The World Health Organization states that ""access to legal, safe and comprehensive abortion care, including post-abortion care, is essential for the attainment of the highest possible level of sexual and reproductive health"".[22] Public health data show that making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths.[23][24]
Around 73 million abortions are performed each year in the world,[25] with about 45% done unsafely.[26] Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008,[27] before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased.[28] As of 2018[update], 37% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason.[29] Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed.[30] Abortion rates are similar between countries that restrict abortion and countries that broadly allow it, though this is partly because countries which restrict abortion tend to have higher unintended pregnancy rates.[31]
Since 1973, there has been a global trend towards greater legal access to abortion,[32] but there remains debate with regard to moral, religious, ethical, and legal issues.[33][34] Those who oppose abortion often argue that an embryo or fetus is a person with a right to life, and thus equate abortion with murder.[35][36] Those who support abortion's legality often argue that it is a woman's reproductive right.[37] Others favor legal and accessible abortion as a public health measure.[38] Abortion laws and views of the procedure are different around the world. In some countries abortion is legal and women have the right to make the choice about abortion.[39] In some areas, abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, incest, fetal defects, poverty, and risk to a woman's health.[40] Historically, abortions have been attempted using herbal medicines, sharp tools, forceful massage, or other traditional methods.[41]
An induced abortion is a medical procedure to end a pregnancy.[42] In present-day English, the term abortion, when used without further qualification, generally refers to induced abortion.[4]
A pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in several ways. The abortion method depends upon the gestational age of the embryo or fetus, which gains mass as the pregnancy progresses.[43][44] Abortion laws, regional availability, and the personal preference of the woman and her doctor may inform the woman's choice of a specific abortion procedure. 
Abortions can be characterized as either therapeutic or elective. When an abortion is performed for medical reasons, the procedure is referred to as a therapeutic abortion. Medical reasons for therapeutic abortion include saving the life of the pregnant woman, preventing harm to the woman's physical or mental health, preventing the birth of a child who will have a significantly increased chance of mortality or morbidity, and reducing the number of fetuses to lessen health risks associated with multiple pregnancy.[45][46] An abortion is referred to as elective or voluntary when it is performed at the request of the woman for non-medical reasons.[46] Confusion sometimes arises over the term elective because ""elective surgery"" generally refers to all scheduled surgery, whether medically necessary or not.[47]
About one in five pregnancies worldwide ends with an induced abortion.[27] Most abortions result from unintended pregnancies.[7][48] In the United Kingdom, 1 to 2% of abortions are done because of genetic problems in the fetus.[19]
Miscarriage, also known as spontaneous abortion, is the unintentional expulsion of an embryo or fetus before the 24th week of gestation.[49] A pregnancy that ends before 37 weeks of gestation resulting in a live-born infant is a ""premature birth"" or a ""preterm birth"".[50] When a fetus dies in utero after viability, or during delivery, it is usually termed ""stillborn"".[51] Premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages, although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap.[52]
Studies of pregnant women in the US and China have shown that between 40% and 60% of embryos do not progress to birth.[53][54][55] The vast majority of miscarriages occur before the woman is aware that she is pregnant,[46] and many pregnancies spontaneously abort before medical practitioners can detect an embryo.[56] Between 15% and 30% of known pregnancies end in clinically apparent miscarriage, depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman.[57] 80% of these spontaneous abortions happen in the first trimester.[58]
The most common cause of spontaneous abortion during the first trimester is chromosomal abnormalities of the embryo or fetus,[46][59] accounting for at least 50% of sampled early pregnancy losses.[60] Other causes include vascular disease (such as lupus), diabetes, other hormonal problems, infection, and abnormalities of the uterus.[59] Advancing maternal age and a woman's history of previous spontaneous abortions are the two leading factors associated with a greater risk of spontaneous abortion.[60] A spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental trauma; intentional trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion or feticide.[61]
Medical abortions are those induced by abortifacient pharmaceuticals. Medical abortion became an alternative method of abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and the antiprogestogen mifepristone (also known as RU-486) in the 1980s.[14][13][62][63]
The most common early first trimester medical abortion regimens use mifepristone in combination with misoprostol (or sometimes another prostaglandin analog, gemeprost) up to 10 weeks (70 days) gestational age,[64][65] methotrexate in combination with a prostaglandin analog up to 7 weeks gestation, or a prostaglandin analog alone.[13] Mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimens work faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexate–misoprostol combination regimens, and combination regimens are more effective than misoprostol alone, particularly in the second trimester.[62][66] Medical abortion regimens involving mifepristone followed by misoprostol in the cheek between 24 and 48 hours later are effective when performed before 70 days' gestation.[65][64]
In very early abortions, up to 7 weeks gestation, medical abortion using a mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimen is considered to be more effective than surgical abortion (vacuum aspiration), especially when clinical practice does not include detailed inspection of aspirated tissue.[67] Early medical abortion regimens using mifepristone, followed 24–48 hours later by buccal or vaginal misoprostol are 98% effective up to 9 weeks gestational age; from 9 to 10 weeks efficacy decreases modestly to 94%.[64][68] If medical abortion fails, surgical abortion must be used to complete the procedure.[69]
Early medical abortions account for the majority of abortions before 9 weeks gestation in Britain,[70] France,[71] Switzerland,[72] United States,[73] and the Nordic countries.[74]
Medical abortion regimens using mifepristone in combination with a prostaglandin analog are the most common methods used for second trimester abortions in Canada, most of Europe, China and India,[63] in contrast to the United States where 96% of second trimester abortions are performed surgically by dilation and evacuation.[75]
A 2020 Cochrane Systematic Review concluded that providing women with medications to take home to complete the second stage of the procedure for an early medical abortion results in an effective abortion.[76] Further research is required to determine if self-administered medical abortion is as safe as provider-administered medical abortion, where a health care professional is present to help manage the medical abortion.[76] Safely permitting women to self-administer abortion medication has the potential to improve access to abortion.[76] The review also noted a research gap concerning methods to support women who take medication at home for a self-administered abortion.[76]
Up to 15 weeks' gestation, suction-aspiration or vacuum aspiration are the most common surgical methods of induced abortion.[77] Manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) consists of removing the fetus or embryo, placenta, and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while electric vacuum aspiration (EVA) uses an electric pump. Both techniques can be used very early in pregnancy. MVA can be used up to 14 weeks but is more often used earlier in the U.S. EVA can be used later.[75]
MVA, also known as ""mini-suction"" and ""menstrual extraction"", or EVA can be used in very early pregnancy when cervical dilation may not be required. Dilation and curettage (D&C) refers to opening the cervix (dilation) and removing tissue (curettage) via suction or sharp instruments. D&C is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. The World Health Organization recommends sharp curettage only when suction aspiration is unavailable.[78]
Dilation and evacuation (D&E), used after 12 to 16 weeks, consists of opening the cervix and emptying the uterus using surgical instruments and suction. D&E is performed vaginally and does not require an incision. Intact dilation and extraction (D&X) refers to a variant of D&E sometimes used after 18 to 20 weeks when removal of an intact fetus improves surgical safety or for other reasons.[79]
Abortion may also be performed surgically by hysterotomy or gravid hysterectomy. Hysterotomy abortion is a procedure similar to a caesarean section and is performed under general anesthesia. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and can be used during later stages of pregnancy. Gravid hysterectomy refers to removal of the whole uterus while still containing the pregnancy. Hysterotomy and hysterectomy are associated with much higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality than D&E or induction abortion.[80]
First trimester procedures can generally be performed using local anesthesia, while second trimester methods may require deep sedation or general anesthesia.[81][82][83]
In places lacking the necessary medical skill for dilation and extraction, or when preferred by practitioners, an abortion can be induced by first inducing labor and then inducing fetal demise if necessary.[84] This is sometimes called ""induced miscarriage"". This procedure may be performed from 13 weeks gestation to the third trimester. Although it is very uncommon in the United States, more than 80% of induced abortions throughout the second trimester are labor-induced abortions in Sweden and other nearby countries.[85]
Only limited data are available comparing labor-induced abortion with the dilation and extraction method.[85] Unlike D&E, labor-induced abortions after 18 weeks may be complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival, which may be legally characterized as live birth. For this reason, labor-induced abortion is legally risky in the United States.[85][86]
Historically, a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in folk medicine. Such herbs include tansy, pennyroyal, black cohosh, and the now-extinct silphium.[87]: 44–47, 62–63, 154–155, 230–231 
In 1978, one woman in Colorado died and another developed organ damage when they attempted to terminate their pregnancies by taking pennyroyal oil.[88]
Because the indiscriminant use of herbs as abortifacients can cause serious—even lethal—side effects, such as multiple organ failure,[89] such use is not recommended by physicians.
Abortion is sometimes attempted by causing trauma to the abdomen. The degree of force, if severe, can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing miscarriage.[90] In Southeast Asia, there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage.[91] One of the bas reliefs decorating the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia depicts a demon performing such an abortion upon a woman who had been sent to the underworld.[91]
Reported methods of unsafe, self-induced abortion include misuse of misoprostol and insertion of non-surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus. These and other methods to terminate pregnancy may be called ""induced miscarriage"".  Such methods are rarely used in countries where surgical abortion is legal and available.[92]
The health risks of abortion depend principally on how, and under what conditions, the procedure is performed. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines unsafe abortions  as a procedure for terminating an unintended pregnancy carried out either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both.[93] Legal abortions performed in the developed world are among the safest procedures in medicine.[11][94] According to a 2012 study in Obstetrics & Gynecology, in the United States the risk of maternal mortality is 14 times lower after induced abortion than after childbirth.[95] The CDC estimated in 2019 that US pregnancy-related mortality was 17.2 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births,[96] while the US abortion mortality rate was 0.43 maternal deaths per 100,000 procedures.[12][97][98] In the UK, guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state that ""Women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term.""[99] Worldwide, on average, abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. A 2007 study reported that ""26% of all pregnancies worldwide are terminated by induced abortion,"" whereas ""deaths from improperly performed [abortion] procedures constitute 13% of maternal mortality globally.""[100] In Indonesia in 2000 it was estimated that 2 million pregnancies ended in abortion, 4.5 million pregnancies were carried to term, and 14–16 percent of maternal deaths resulted from abortion.[101]
In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a mortality rate lower than plastic surgery, lower or similar to running a marathon, and about equivalent to traveling 760 miles (1,220 km) in a passenger car.[12] Five years after seeking abortion services, women who gave birth after being denied an abortion reported worse health than women who had either first or second trimester abortions.[102] The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth.[103] Outpatient abortion is as safe from 64 to 70 days' gestation as it before 63 days.[104]
There is little difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol and surgical abortion (vacuum aspiration) in early first trimester abortions up to 10 weeks gestation.[67] Medical abortion using the prostaglandin analog misoprostol alone is less effective and more painful than medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol or surgical abortion.[105][106]
Vacuum aspiration in the first trimester is the safest method of surgical abortion, and can be performed in a primary care office, abortion clinic, or hospital. Complications, which are rare, can include uterine perforation, pelvic infection, and retained products of conception requiring a second procedure to evacuate.[107] Infections account for one-third of abortion-related deaths in the United States.[108] The rate of complications of vacuum aspiration abortion in the first trimester is similar regardless of whether the procedure is performed in a hospital, surgical center, or office.[109] Preventive antibiotics (such as doxycycline or metronidazole) are typically given before abortion procedures,[110] as they are believed to substantially reduce the risk of postoperative uterine infection;[81][111] however, antibiotics are not routinely given with abortion pills.[112] The rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the abortion is performed by a doctor or a mid-level practitioner.[113]
Complications after second trimester abortion are similar to those after first trimester abortion, and depend somewhat on the method chosen.[114] The risk of death from abortion approaches roughly half the risk of death from childbirth the farther along a woman is in pregnancy; from one in a million before 9 weeks gestation to nearly one in ten thousand at 21 weeks or more (as measured from the last menstrual period).[115][116] It appears that having had a prior surgical uterine evacuation (whether because of induced abortion or treatment of miscarriage) correlates with a small increase in the risk of preterm birth in future pregnancies. The studies supporting this did not control for factors not related to abortion or miscarriage, and hence the causes of this correlation have not been determined, although multiple possibilities have been suggested.[117][118]
Current evidence finds no relationship between most induced abortions and mental health problems[19][119] other than those expected for any unwanted pregnancy.[120] A report by the American Psychological Association concluded that a woman's first abortion is not a threat to mental health when carried out in the first trimester, with such women no more likely to have mental-health problems than those carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term; the mental-health outcome of a woman's second or greater abortion is less certain.[120][121] Some older reviews concluded that abortion was associated with an increased risk of psychological problems;[122] however, later reviews of the medical literature found that previous reviews did not use an appropriate control group.[119] When a control group is utilized, receiving abortion is not associated with adverse psychological outcomes.[119] However, women seeking abortion who are denied access to abortion have an increase in anxiety after the denial.[119]
Although some studies show negative mental-health outcomes in women who choose abortions after the first trimester because of fetal abnormalities,[123] more rigorous research would be needed to show this conclusively.[124] Some proposed negative psychological effects of abortion have been referred to by anti-abortion advocates as a separate condition called ""post-abortion syndrome"", but this is not recognized by medical or psychological professionals in the United States.[125]
A 2020 long term-study among US women found that about 99% of women felt that they made the right decision five years after they had an abortion. Relief was the primary emotion with few women feeling sadness or guilt. Social stigma was a main factor predicting negative emotions and regret years later.  The researchers also stated: ""These results add to the scientific evidence that emotions about an abortion are associated with personal and social context, and are not a product of the abortion procedure itself.""[126]
Some purported risks of abortion are promoted primarily by anti-abortion groups,[127][128] but lack scientific support.[127] For example, the question of a link between induced abortion and breast cancer has been investigated extensively. Major medical and scientific bodies (including the WHO, National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Royal College of OBGYN and American Congress of OBGYN) have concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer.[129]
In the past even illegality has not automatically meant that the abortions were unsafe. Referring to the U.S., historian Linda Gordon states: ""In fact, illegal abortions in this country have an impressive safety record.""[130]: 25 
According to Rickie Solinger,
A related myth, promulgated by a broad spectrum of people concerned about abortion and public policy, is that before legalization abortionists were dirty and dangerous back-alley butchers.... [T]he historical evidence does not support such claims.[131]: 4 
A 1940s American physician spoke of his pride in having performed 13,844 illegal abortions without any fatalities.[132]
In 1870s New York City, the abortionist/midwife Madame Restell (Anna Trow Lohman) is said to have lost very few women among her more than 100,000 patients[133]—a lower mortality rate than the childbirth mortality rate at the time. In 1936, obstetrics and gynecology professor  Frederick J. Taussig wrote that a cause of increasing mortality during the years of illegality in the U.S. was that
With each decade of the past fifty years the actual and proportionate frequency of this accident [perforation of the uterus] has increased, due, first, to the increase in the number of instrumentally induced abortions; second, to the proportionate increase in abortions handled by doctors as against those handled by midwives; and, third, to the prevailing tendency to use instruments instead of the finger in emptying the uterus.[134]
Women seeking an abortion may use unsafe methods, especially when abortion is legally restricted. They may attempt self-induced abortion or seek the help of a person without proper medical training or facilities. This can lead to severe complications, such as incomplete abortion, sepsis, hemorrhage, and damage to internal organs.[135]
Unsafe abortions are a major cause of injury and death among women worldwide. Although data are imprecise, it is estimated that approximately 20 million unsafe abortions are performed annually, with 97% taking place in developing countries.[11] Unsafe abortions are believed to result in millions of injuries.[11][136] Estimates of deaths vary according to methodology, and have ranged from 37,000 to 70,000 in the past decade;[11][137][138] deaths from unsafe abortion account for around 13% of all maternal deaths.[139] The World Health Organization believes that mortality has fallen since the 1990s.[140] To reduce the number of unsafe abortions, public health organizations have generally advocated emphasizing the legalization of abortion, training of medical personnel, and ensuring access to reproductive-health services.[141]
A major factor in whether abortions are performed safely or not is the legal standing of abortion. Countries with restrictive abortion laws have higher rates of unsafe abortion and similar overall abortion rates compared to countries where abortion is legal and available.[137][27] For example, the 1996 legalization of abortion in South Africa led to an immediate reduction in abortion-related complications,[142] with abortion-related deaths dropping by more than 90%.[143] Similar reductions in maternal mortality have been observed after other countries have liberalized their abortion laws, such as Romania and Nepal.[144] A 2011 study concluded that in the United States, some state-level anti-abortion laws are correlated with lower rates of abortion in that state.[145] The analysis, however, did not take into account travel to other states without such laws to obtain an abortion.[146] In addition, a lack of access to effective contraception contributes to unsafe abortion. It has been estimated that the incidence of unsafe abortion could be reduced by up to 75% (from 20 million to 5 million annually) if modern family planning and maternal health services were readily available globally.[147] Rates of such abortions may be difficult to measure because they can be reported variously as miscarriage, ""induced miscarriage"", ""menstrual regulation"", ""mini-abortion"", and ""regulation of a delayed/suspended menstruation"".[11][148]
Forty percent of the world's women are able to access therapeutic and elective abortions within gestational limits,[30] while an additional 35 percent have access to legal abortion if they meet certain physical, mental, or socioeconomic criteria.[40] While maternal mortality seldom results from safe abortions, unsafe abortions result in 70,000 deaths and 5 million disabilities per year.[137] Complications of unsafe abortion account for approximately an eighth of maternal mortalities worldwide,[149] though this varies by region.[150] Secondary infertility caused by an unsafe abortion affects an estimated 24 million women.[151] The rate of unsafe abortions has increased from 44% to 49% between 1995 and 2008.[27] Health education, access to family planning, and improvements in health care during and after abortion have been proposed to address consequences of unsafe abortion.[152]
There are two commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of abortion:
In many places, where abortion is illegal or carries a heavy social stigma, medical reporting of abortion is not reliable.[154] For this reason, estimates of the incidence of abortion must be made without determining certainty related to standard error.[27] The number of abortions performed worldwide was characterized as stable in the early 2000s, with 41.6 million having been performed in 2003 and 43.8 million having been performed in 2008.[27] The abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women per year, though it was 24 per 1000 women per year for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women per year for developing countries.[27] The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries.[27]
On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion.[155] Restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely.[30][156][155] The unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly attributable to lack of access to modern contraceptives; according to the Guttmacher Institute, providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide.[157]
The rate of legal, induced abortion varies extensively worldwide. According to the report of employees of Guttmacher Institute it ranged from 7 per 1000 women per year (Germany and Switzerland) to 30 per 1000 women per year (Estonia) in countries with complete statistics in 2008. The proportion of pregnancies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about 10% (Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland) to 30% (Estonia) in the same group, though it might be as high as 36% in Hungary and Romania, whose statistics were deemed incomplete.[158][159]
An American study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of contraception at the time of becoming pregnant. Inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and three-quarters of those using the birth control pill; 42% of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage.[160]  Of the other half of women, who were not using contraception at the time of becoming pregnant, the vast majority had used contraception at some point in the past, indicating some level of dissatisfaction with the contraceptive options available to them.  Indeed, 32% of these contraceptive nonusers cited concerns about contraceptive methods as their reason for nonuse,[160] and a more recent study found similar results.[161]  Taken together, these statistics suggest that new contraceptive methods, such as non-hormonal contraceptives or male contraceptives, could reduce unintended pregnancy and abortion rates.[162]
The Guttmacher Institute has found that ""most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women"" because minority women ""have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy"".[163] In a 2022 analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, while people of color comprise 44% of the population in Mississippi, 59% of the population in Texas, 42% of the population in Louisiana, and 35% of the population in Alabama, they comprise 80%, 74%, 72%, and 70%, respectively, of those receiving abortions.[164]
Abortion rates vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 26% of reported legal induced abortions in the United States were known to have been obtained at the end of 6 weeks of gestation or less, 18% at 7 weeks, 15% at 8 weeks, 18% at 9 through 10 weeks, 10% at 11 through 12 weeks, 6% at 13 through 15 weeks, 4% at 16 through 20 weeks and 1% at more than 21 weeks. 91% of these were classified as having been done by ""curettage"" (suction-aspiration, dilation and curettage, dilation and evacuation), 8% by ""medical"" means (mifepristone), >1% by ""intrauterine instillation"" (saline or prostaglandin), and 1% by ""other"" (including hysterotomy and hysterectomy).[165] According to the CDC, due to data collection difficulties the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond 20 weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion.[9]
The Guttmacher Institute estimated there were 2,200 intact dilation and extraction procedures in the US during 2000; this accounts for <0.2% of the total number of abortions performed that year.[166] Similarly, in England and Wales in 2006, 89% of terminations occurred at or under 12 weeks, 9% between 13 and 19 weeks, and 2% at or over 20 weeks. 64% of those reported were by vacuum aspiration, 6% by D&E, and 30% were medical.[167] There are more second trimester abortions in developing countries such as China, India and Vietnam than in developed countries.[168][needs update]
There are both medical and non-medical reasons to have an abortion later in pregnancy (after 20 weeks). A study was conducted from 2008 to 2010 at the University of California San Francisco where more than 440 women were asked about why they experienced delays in obtaining abortion care, if there were any. This study found that almost half of individuals who obtained an abortion after 20 weeks did not suspect that they were pregnant until later in their pregnancy.[169] Other barriers to abortion care found in the study included lack of information about where to access an abortion, difficulties with transportation, lack of insurance coverage, and inability to pay for the abortion procedure.[169]
Medical reasons for seeking an abortion later in pregnancy include fetal anomalies and health risk to the pregnant person.[170] There are prenatal tests that can diagnose Down Syndrome or cystic fibrosis as early as 10 weeks into gestation, but structural fetal anomalies are often detected much later in pregnancy.[169] A proportion of structural fetal anomalies are lethal, which means that the fetus will almost certainly die before or shortly after birth.[169] Life-threatening conditions may also develop later in pregnancy, such as early severe preeclampsia, newly diagnosed cancer in need of urgent treatment, and intrauterine infection (chorioamnionitis), which often occurs along with premature rupture of the amniotic sac (PPROM).[169] If serious medical conditions such as these arise before the fetus is viable, the person carrying the pregnancy may pursue an abortion to preserve their own health.[169]
The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.[9][7][8] Some of the reasons may include an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, and the wish to complete education or advance a career.[10] Additional reasons include not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.[7][171]
Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures.[172] These might include the preference for children of a specific sex or race, disapproval of single or early motherhood, stigmatization of people with disabilities, insufficient economic support for families, lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods, or efforts toward population control (such as China's one-child policy). These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or sex-selective abortion.[173] In cultures where there is a preference for male children, some women have sex selective abortions, which have partially replaced the earlier practice of female infanticide.[173]
Some abortions are performed due to concerns over maternal health. In 1990s, women cited maternal health as their main motivating factor in about a third of abortions in three of 27 countries analyzed. In seven additional countries, about 7% of abortions were maternal health related.[9][7]
In the U.S., the Supreme Court decisions in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton: ""ruled that the state's interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only at the point of viability, defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently of its mother. Even after the point of viability, the state cannot favor the life of the fetus over the life or health of the pregnant woman. Under the right of privacy, physicians must be free to use their ""medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother."" On the same day that the Court decided Roe, it also decided Doe v. Bolton, in which the Court defined health very broadly: ""The medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors—physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age—relevant to the well-being of the patient. All these factors may relate to health. This allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment.""[174]: 1200–1201 
The rate of cancer during pregnancy is 0.02–1%, and in many cases, cancer of the mother leads to consideration of abortion to protect the life of the mother, or in response to the potential damage that may occur to the fetus during treatment. This is particularly true for cervical cancer, the most common type of which occurs in 1 of every 2,000–13,000 pregnancies, for which initiation of treatment ""cannot co-exist with preservation of fetal life (unless neoadjuvant chemotherapy is chosen)"". Very early stage cervical cancers (I and IIa) may be treated by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection, radiation therapy, or both, while later stages are treated by radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used simultaneously. Treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations, because lumpectomy is discouraged in favor of modified radical mastectomy unless late-term pregnancy allows follow-up radiation therapy to be administered after the birth.[175]
Exposure to a single chemotherapy drug is estimated to cause a 7.5–17% risk of teratogenic effects on the fetus, with higher risks for multiple drug treatments. Treatment with more than 40 Gy of radiation usually causes spontaneous abortion. Exposure to much lower doses during the first trimester, especially 8 to 15 weeks of development, can cause intellectual disability or microcephaly, and exposure at this or subsequent stages can cause reduced intrauterine growth and birth weight. Exposures above 0.005–0.025 Gy cause a dose-dependent reduction in IQ.[175] It is possible to greatly reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding, depending on how far the area to be irradiated is from the fetus.[176][177]
The process of birth itself may also put the mother at risk. According to Li et al., ""[v]aginal delivery may result in dissemination of neoplastic cells into lymphovascular channels, haemorrhage, cervical laceration and implantation of malignant cells in the episiotomy site, while abdominal delivery may delay the initiation of non-surgical treatment.""[178]
Congenital disorders, revealed by prenatal screening, motivate some women to seek abortions.[7] Health outcomes of preterm births include a significant probability of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment before gestational age of 29 weeks, with a higher probability with decreasing gestational age.[179]
In the United States, public opinion shifted after television personality Sherri Finkbine's was exposed to thalidomide, a teratogen, in her fifth month of pregnancy. Unable to obtain a legal abortion in the United States, Finkbine traveled to Sweden. From 1962 to 1965, an outbreak of German measles left 15,000 babies with severe birth defects. In 1967, the American Medical Association publicly supported liberalization of abortion laws. A National Opinion Research Center poll in 1965 showed 73% supported abortion when the mother's life was at risk, 57% when birth defects were present and 59% for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.[180]
Since ancient times, abortions have been done using a number of methods, including herbal medicines acting as abortifacients, sharp tools through the use of force, or through other traditional medicine methods.[41] Induced abortion has a long history and can be traced back to civilizations as varied as ancient China (abortifacient knowledge is often attributed to the mythological ruler Shennong),[182] ancient India since its Vedic age,[183] ancient Egypt with its Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE), and the Roman Empire in the time of Juvenal (c. 200 CE).[41] One of the earliest known artistic representations of abortion is in a bas relief at Angkor Wat (c. 1150). Found in a series of friezes that represent judgment after death in Hindu and Buddhist culture, it depicts the technique of abdominal abortion.[91]
Some medical scholars and abortion opponents have suggested that the Hippocratic Oath forbade physicians in Ancient Greece from performing abortions;[41] other scholars disagree with this interpretation,[41] and state that the medical texts of Hippocratic Corpus contain descriptions of abortive techniques right alongside the Oath.[184] In Politics (350 BCE), Aristotle condemned infanticide as a means of population control. He preferred abortion in such cases,[185][186] with the restriction that it ""must be practised on it before it has developed sensation and life; for the line between lawful and unlawful abortion will be marked by the fact of having sensation and being alive.""[187] Abortion has been a fairly common practice,[188][189] and was not always illegal or controversial until the 19th century.[190][191] In Europe and North America, abortion techniques advanced starting in the 17th century; the conservatism of most in the medical profession with regards to sexual matters prevented the wide expansion of abortion techniques.[41][192][193] Other medical practitioners in addition to some physicians advertised their services, and they were not widely regulated until the 19th century when the practice, sometimes called restellism,[194] was banned in both the United States and the United Kingdom.[41][nb 3]
Some 19th-century physicians, argued for anti-abortion laws on racist and misogynist as well as moral grounds.[197][198][199] Church groups were also highly influential in anti-abortion movements,[41][190][197] and religious groups more so since the 20th century.[200] Some of the early anti-abortion laws punished only the doctor or abortionist,[195] and while women could be criminally tried for a self-induced abortion,[201] they were rarely prosecuted in general.[190] Some maintain that in the 19th century early abortions under the hygienic conditions in which midwives usually worked were relatively safe.[202][203][204] Several scholars argue that, despite improved medical procedures, the period from the 1930s until the 1970s saw more zealous enforcement of anti-abortion laws, alongside an increasing control of abortion providers by organized crime.[nb 4] In 1920, Soviet Russia became the first country to legalize abortion after Lenin insisted that no woman be forced to give birth.[205][206] Abortion was then legalized in some form in Iceland (1935), Sweden (1938), Nazi Germany (1935)[207] and Japan (1948)[208][209][210] Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, abortion was legalized in a greater number of countries.[41]
In the Catholic Church, opinion was divided on how serious abortion was in comparison with such acts as contraception and oral or anal sex.[211]: 155–167  The Catholic Church did not begin vigorously opposing abortion until the 19th century.[41][195] As early as ~100 CE, the Didache taught that abortion was sinful.[212] Several historians argue that prior to the 19th century most Catholic authors did not regard termination of pregnancy before quickening or ensoulment as an abortion.[213][214][215] In 1588, Pope Sixtus V (r.  1585–1590) was the first Pope to institute a Church policy labeling all abortion as homicide and condemning abortion regardless of the stage of pregnancy.[216][211]: 362–364 [87]: 157–158  Sixtus V's pronouncement was reversed in 1591 by Pope Gregory XIV.[217] In the recodification of 1917 Code of Canon Law, Apostolicae Sedis was strengthened, in part to remove a possible reading that excluded excommunication of the mother.[218] Statements made in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the codified summary of the Church's teachings, considers abortion from the moment of conception as homicide and called for the end of legal abortion.[219]
In Judaism, the fetus is not considered to have a human soul until it is safely outside of the woman, is viable, and has taken its first breath.[220][221][222] The fetus is considered valuable property of the woman and not a human life while in the womb (Exodus 21:22-23). While Judaism encourages people to be fruitful and multiply by having children, abortion is allowed and is deemed necessary when a pregnant woman's life is in danger.[223][224] Several religions, including Judaism, which disagree that human life begins at conception, support the legality of abortion on religious freedom grounds.[195]
In Islam, abortion is traditionally permitted until a point in time when Muslims believe the soul enters the fetus,[41] considered by various theologians to be at conception, 40 days after conception, 120 days after conception, or at quickening.[225] Abortion is largely heavily restricted or forbidden in areas of high Islamic faith such as the Middle East and North Africa.[226]
Hindu views on abortion are diverse and lack a single authoritative position, shaped by principles like ahimsa (non-violence), karma, and reincarnation, which typically regard it as morally wrong for interrupting the soul's cycle.[227] Scriptures often equate abortion to grave sins, with the fetus considered ensouled from conception or early gestation.[228] However, it may be ethically permissible to save the mother's life or in cases of severe fetal abnormalities, prioritizing lesser harm.[229] Modern opinions differ regionally: In India, a majority view abortion as generally illegal, while in the US, most Hindus support legal access in all or most cases.[230]
Denominations that support abortion rights with some limits include the United Methodist Church, Episcopal Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and Presbyterian Church USA.[231] A 2014 Guttmacher survey of abortion patients in the United States found that many reported a religious affiliation: 24% were Catholic while 30% were Protestant.[232] A 1995 survey reported that Catholic women are as likely as the general population to terminate a pregnancy, Protestants are less likely to do so, and evangelical Christians are the least likely to do so.[9][7] A 2019 Pew Research Center study found that most Christian denominations were against overturning Roe v. Wade, which in the United States legalized abortion, at around 70%, except White Evangelicals at 35%.[233]
Induced abortion has long been the source of considerable debate. Ethical, moral, philosophical, biological, religious and legal issues surrounding abortion are related to value systems. Opinions of abortion may be about fetal rights, governmental authority, and women's rights.
In both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or the justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion.[234] The World Medical Association Declaration on Therapeutic Abortion notes, ""circumstances bringing the interests of a mother into conflict with the interests of her unborn child create a dilemma and raise the question as to whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated.""[235] Abortion debates, especially pertaining to abortion laws, are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions. Groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion, including complete prohibition, most often describe themselves as ""pro-life"" while groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as ""pro-choice"".[236]
Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural factors continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The right to life, the right to liberty, the right to security of person, and the right to reproductive health are major issues of human rights that sometimes constitute the basis for the existence or absence of abortion laws.
In jurisdictions where abortion is legal, certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a legal abortion (an abortion performed without the woman's consent is considered feticide and is generally illegal). These requirements usually depend on the age of the fetus, often using a trimester-based system to regulate the window of legality, or as in the U.S., on a doctor's evaluation of the fetus' viability. Some jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on fetal development, or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion.[237] Other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the consent of the fetus' father before aborting the fetus, that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure—sometimes including ""risks"" not supported by the medical literature—and that multiple medical authorities certify that the abortion is either medically or socially necessary. Many restrictions are waived in emergency situations. China, which has ended their[238] one-child policy, and now has a three-child policy,[239] has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their population control strategy.[240]
Other jurisdictions ban abortion almost entirely. Many, but not all, of these allow legal abortions in a variety of circumstances. These circumstances vary based on jurisdiction, but may include whether the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest, the fetus' development is impaired, the woman's physical or mental well-being is endangered, or socioeconomic considerations make childbirth a hardship.[40] In countries where abortion is banned entirely, such as Nicaragua, medical authorities have recorded rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy as well as deaths due to doctors' fears of prosecution if they treat other gynecological emergencies.[241][242] Some countries, such as Bangladesh, that nominally ban abortion, may also support clinics that perform abortions under the guise of menstrual hygiene.[243] This is also a terminology in traditional medicine.[244] In places where abortion is illegal or carries heavy social stigma, pregnant women may engage in medical tourism and travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancies.[245] Women on Waves has provided medication abortion and education on a ship in international waters off the coast of countries with restrictive abortion laws.[246][247][248] Women without the means to travel can resort to providers of illegal abortions or attempt to perform an abortion by themselves.[249]
Sonography and amniocentesis allow parents to determine sex before childbirth. The development of this technology has led to sex-selective abortion, or the termination of a fetus based on its sex. The selective termination of a female fetus is most common.
Sex-selective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in Taiwan, South Korea, India, and China.[250] This deviation from the standard birth rates of males and females occurs despite the fact that the country in question may have officially banned sex-selective abortion or even sex-screening.[251][252][253][254]
Many countries have taken legislative steps to reduce the incidence of sex-selective abortion. At the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994 over 180 states agreed to eliminate ""all forms of discrimination against the girl child and the root causes of son preference"",[255] conditions also condemned by a PACE resolution in 2011.[256] The World Health Organization and UNICEF, along with other United Nations agencies, have found that measures to restrict access to abortion in an effort to reduce sex-selective abortions have unintended negative consequences, largely stemming from the fact that women may seek or be coerced into seeking unsafe, extralegal abortions.[255] On the other hand, measures to reduce gender inequality can reduce the prevalence of such abortions without attendant negative consequences.[255][257]
Abortion providers and facilities have been subjected to violence, including murder, assault, arson, and bombing. Some scholars consider anti-abortion violence to be within the definition of terrorism,[258] a view shared by some governments.[259] In the U.S. and Canada, over 8,000 incidents of violence, trespassing, and death threats have been recorded by providers since 1977, including over 200 bombings/arsons and hundreds of assaults.[260] Abortion clinics have also been targeted by acid attacks, invasions, and vandalism[261] The majority of abortion opponents have not been involved in violent acts. 
Physicians and other abortion clinic staff have been murdered by abortion opponents. In the United States, at least four physicians have been murdered in connection with their work at abortion clinics, including David Gunn (1993), John Britton (1994), Barnett Slepian (1998), and George Tiller (2009). In Canada, gynecologist Garson Romalis survived murder attempts in both 1994 and 2000. Besides physicians, killings have targeted other clinic staff, such as John Salvi's 1994 murder of two receptionists in Massachusetts clinic and Peter Knight's 2001 murder of a security guard in a Melbourne clinic. Notable perpetrators of anti-abortion violence include Eric Rudolph, Scott Roeder, Shelley Shannon, and Paul Hill, the first person to be executed in the United States for murdering an abortion provider.[262]
Some countries have laws to protecting access to abortion. 
Such laws prevent abortion opponents from interfering with access to legal abortion services. For example, the American Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act bars the use of threats or violence to interfere with abortion access. Abortion access laws may also establish safe access zones around abortion clinics, with limits on protests and enhanced penalties for anti-abortion violence.[263]
Psychological pressure may also be used to limit abortion access. Some protestors record women entering clinics on camera.[264]
Spontaneous abortion occurs in various animals. For example, in sheep it may be caused by stress or physical exertion, such as crowding through doors or being chased by dogs.[265] In cows, abortion may be caused by contagious disease, such as brucellosis or Campylobacter, but can often be controlled by vaccination.[266] Eating pine needles can also induce abortions in cows.[267][268] Several plants, including broomweed, skunk cabbage, poison hemlock, and tree tobacco, are known to cause fetal deformities and abortion in cattle[269]: 45–46  and in sheep and goats.[269]: 77–80  In horses, a fetus may be aborted or reabsorbed if it has lethal white syndrome. Foal embryos that are homozygous for the dominant white gene (WW) are theorized to also be aborted or resorbed before birth.[270] In many species of sharks and rays, stress-induced abortions occur frequently on capture.[271]
Viral infection can cause abortion in dogs.[272] Cats can experience spontaneous abortion for many reasons, including hormonal imbalance. A combined abortion and spaying is performed on pregnant cats, especially in trap–neuter–return programs, to prevent unwanted kittens from being born.[273][274][275] Female rodents may terminate a pregnancy when exposed to the smell of a male not responsible for the pregnancy, known as the Bruce effect.[276]
Abortion may also be induced in animals, in the context of animal husbandry. For example, abortion may be induced in mares that have been mated improperly, or that have been purchased by owners who did not realize the mares were pregnant, or that are pregnant with twin foals.[277] Feticide can occur in horses and zebras due to male harassment of pregnant mares or forced copulation,[278][279][280] although the frequency in the wild has been questioned.[281] Male gray langur monkeys may attack females following male takeover, causing miscarriage.[282]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_Super_Star,Kirby Super Star,"Kirby Super Star,[a] released as Kirby's Fun Pak in PAL regions, is a 1996 anthology action-platform game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is part of the Kirby series of video games by HAL Laboratory. The game was advertised as a compilation featuring eight games: seven short subsections with the same basic gameplay, and two minigames.
An enhanced remake titled Kirby Super Star Ultra was released for the Nintendo DS in 2008 and 2009 to commercial and critical success, selling just under 3 million copies.[1][2] The original game has also been digitally rereleased multiple times.
Kirby Super Star is a side-scrolling platform game. Similar to previous entries in the Kirby series, the player controls the titular character Kirby to complete various levels while avoiding obstacles and enemies. Kirby can walk or run, jump, swim, crouch, slide, and inhale enemies or objects to spit them out as bullets. He can fly for a limited time by inflating himself; while flying, Kirby cannot attack or use his other abilities, though he can release a weak puff of air. By eating certain enemies, Kirby can gain copy abilities, power-ups allowing him to take on the properties the enemy possessed. In Kirby Super Star, Kirby gains the ability to guard so he can defend himself from weak attacks.
If Kirby uses a copy ability, he can produce a Helper, a character that can be controlled automatically or by another player. Like Kirby, Helpers can float continuously, but can only use the copy ability they were based on. The player can also grant the Helper a different form or revert them into a power-up in an emergency. The player characters lose health if they are hit by enemies or hazards. If the Helper loses all their health, there is a short time for Kirby to grant it a new power before it disappears. If Kirby loses all of his health, the player will lose a life. Health can be replenished by eating food scattered across levels. Losing all lives results in a game over.
Kirby Super Star is split into seven smaller games, six primary and one supplemental, in addition to two minigames. While most retain the same game mechanics, they have different stories and objectives. Some games must be unlocked by playing others, and all must be finished to complete the game.
Kirby Super Star was developed in Japan by HAL Laboratory[3] and directed by Kirby creator Masahiro Sakurai. It was the third Kirby game he directed, following Kirby's Dream Land and Kirby's Adventure.[4] Although a Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) title, the Kirby Super Star prototype was developed for the original Nintendo Entertainment System. According to Sakurai, although the prototype was for internal use only, it was almost complete and some of Kirby's animations were nearly identical in the final game. The prototype was used to test out ideas before implementing them in the final product; Sakurai said having the game operating on an internal build made it easier to develop ideas.[5] HAL president Satoru Iwata had little involvement with the game, and left development under Sakurai's supervision.[4]
For Kirby Super Star, Sakurai ""had three pillars in mind. One was two-player cooperative gameplay and another was including actions similar to those in fighting games. The third was an omnibus format.""[4] The addition of cooperative gameplay was something Shigeru Miyamoto requested. While Sakurai knew a SNES Kirby game would mean bigger, more detailed characters and graphics, he wanted to hear from Miyamoto before thinking about the foundation and other important aspects. Sakurai and Iwata traveled to Kyoto; there, Miyamoto told them he wanted cooperative gameplay, something uncommon in side-scrolling platform games. Miyamoto had dreamed of creating a cooperative game in his Super Mario franchise for many years, but was unable to until New Super Mario Bros. Wii in 2009 because of how fast the series' gameplay is. Kirby, on the other hand, is slower-paced, so Miyamoto figured it would be possible. Sakurai thought about it and came up with the idea to have a main player and an assisting one; this led to the conception of Helpers, which he thought opened the door for inexperienced players.[4]
As for why I made it an ""omnibus,"" I did it because I thought we were seeing too many games that took too long to beat. At the time, more and more massive games kept hitting the market. And they all took a long time to finish. By creating an ""omnibus"" collection of quick-to-beat individual scenarios, each complete with their own unique gameplay, I thought I could provide a lot of content without causing players to grow tired of any one style.— Masahiro Sakurai (translated)[6] As for including fighting game-like moves, Sakurai made enemies stronger. He did this because ""[t]he main player would simply hurl blades and lay waste to opponents while the Helper just watched.""[4] Additionally, he expanded copy abilities' possibilities so players could perform multiple actions by pressing the same button, similar to fighting games.[4] The game was also the first in the series in which Kirby's appearance changed depending on his copy ability. The omnibus format was chosen because Sakurai noted most SNES and some NES games were of considerable length, and prices were high. Kirby Super Star served as ""the antithesis to that trend,"" with Sakurai hoping to create sections with different stories and gameplay that appealed to both experienced and inexperienced players.[4][7] Spring Breeze, a remake of Kirby's Dream Land, was designed for beginners and is thus Super Star's first mode. The title is a quote from the Dream Land manual that ""describe[s] Kirby as a youth who came with the spring breeze,"" and was chosen to signify its simplicity.[4] Originally, Sakurai was going to remove copy abilities to remain faithful to the original game while teaching beginners how to play, but ultimately did not.[4]
Development lasted three years, longer than usual for the era. This was partially due to the influence of Rare's Donkey Kong Country (1994), a game that incorporated computer-generated (CG) graphics. Sakurai was certain using CG would be beneficial, so the team redid the artwork about halfway through development. HAL's development schedule also lengthened development. Sakurai planned to include an additional game mode, Kagero Mansion, which was discarded due to time constraints. Kagero Mansion was a horror game with an emphasis on action and puzzle elements; it saw Kirby stuck in a mansion and unable to inhale.[4] HAL also planned to add a move that allowed Kirby to create an explosion from guarding, but cut the idea.[7] The game's working title was Kirby of the Stars: Active, which ""suggest[ed] that the game was more proactive and had more active gameplay.""[4] Mother series creator Shigesato Itoi came up with the final title, which Sakurai said ""convey[s] how rich it is in content"".[4]
Kirby Super Star was one of the last SNES games, released just three months before the launch of the system's successor, the Nintendo 64.[4] Publisher Nintendo released the game in Japan on March 21, 1996,[8] in North America on September 20, 1996,[9] and in Europe on January 23, 1997.[10] In Japan, the title is Kirby of the Stars: Super Deluxe,[4] while in Europe, it is Kirby's Fun Pak.[10] The Japanese packaging was designed to resemble a Paulownia wooden box, an idea that originated from Itoi. In Japan, expensive sake and silverware is often sold in Paulownia boxes; the team thought the packaging would convey that the game was special.[4][7] While noting that it seems unrelated to the game, Sakurai commented that this cover illustrated the heart of Kirby Super Star and praised Itoi's idea.[11]
Kirby Super Star was rereleased on the Wii and Wii U via Nintendo's Virtual Console digital distribution service. The Wii version was released in Japan in October 2009 and in the West in May 2010, and the Wii U version was released worldwide in May 2013.[3] The game was also included in Kirby's Dream Collection (2012), a 20th anniversary compilation of Kirby titles for the Wii.[12] Kirby Super Star is also included in the Super NES Classic Edition.[13] Nintendo released the game on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System app via its Nintendo Classics service on December 12, 2019.[14] A special version with the secret modes unlocked was later released on June 9, 2022.[15]
Kirby Super Star was both a critical and commercial success, selling over one million copies in Japan.[23] It received ""favorable"" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings,[22] and is widely regarded as one of the best games of the franchise.[24] The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly applauded the large amount of content, simultaneous two-player mode, graphics, and Kirby's power-absorbing ability.[17] Captain Cameron of GamePro gave it a perfect 5 out of 5 in sound, control, and FunFactor, and a 4.5 out of 5 in graphics. He commented that ""The perfect execution of the varied controls leads to simple-but-charming fun.""[18] Reviewing the Virtual Console release, Nintendo Life praised the ""impressive"" musical score and ""colorful"" visuals.[21]
Electronic Gaming Monthly named Kirby Super Star a runner-up for Side-Scrolling Game of the Year (behind Guardian Heroes).[25] Gamesradar ranked the game at number 19 in their ""The Best SNES Game of All Time.""[26] In 2018, Complex listed Kirby Super Star number 51 in its ""The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time.""[27] IGN rated Kirby Super Star 47th on their ""Top 100 SNES Games."" They praised the game calling it an incredible game and having incredible value.[28]
Kirby Super Star was given an enhanced remake in the form of Kirby Super Star Ultra to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. The remake features four new modes, three new minigames, and multiple additions to the base game including new sub-bosses and enemies. The remake was released in North America on September 22, 2008, to critical and commercial success, selling just under three million copies worldwide.[2]
Many of the music tracks in Kirby Super Star have been remixed in various games, such as the Super Smash Bros. series; the Nintendo 64 game, for instance, had a new version of the Gourmet Race theme as Kirby's theme song.
Meta Knight's battleship, the Halberd, would reappear in several games such as Kirby: Squeak Squad, Kirby's Epic Yarn,[29] Kirby: Planet Robobot, and the Super Smash Bros. series.
A stage based on The Great Cave Offensive appears in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. In reference to the scope of the mode of the same name, the arena is amongst the largest stages in the game's catalog, and thus supports up to eight players. It features a unique mechanic dubbed the ""Danger Zones"", stage hazards that instantly KO any fighter whose damage percentages exceed 100%.[30] The stage was also included in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.[31]
In 2021, Charlie Rosen and Jake Silverman arranged the composition ""Meta Knight's Revenge"" for The 8-Bit Big Band. Their cover was subsequently nominated for and won the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella.[32]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusajiro_Yamauchi,Fusajiro Yamauchi,"
Fusajirō Yamauchi (山内 房治郎, Yamauchi Fusajirō; November 22, 1859 – January 1, 1940),[1][2] originally born as Fusajirō Fukui (福井 房治郎, Fukui Fusajirō), was a Japanese entrepreneur who founded Yamauchi Nintendo, later known as Nintendo.  Yamauchi lived in Kyoto, Japan and had a wife and two daughters—one of whom was Tei Yamauchi, who later married Sekiryō Kaneda, the successor and second president of Nintendo.
Fusajirō Fukui was born on November 22, 1859, as the oldest son of Sōsuke Fukui, a craftsperson.[3] Fusajirō took the name Yamauchi after an arranged marriage with one of the daughters of the Yamauchi family, who owned a company named Haigan dealing with lime. Since the Yamauchi family had no male heirs to inherit the company, Fusajirō was adopted by the Yamauchis and became the heir to his adoptive father, Naoshichi Yamauchi.[3]
Shortly after, in 1885, Fusajirō inherited the company at the age of 17 and renamed it Haikyō.[3]
In the context of the Meiji Restoration, in 1885, gambling laws were relaxed in Japan, and Hanafuda cards, which were previously banned, became legal.[4] Fusajiro, after having opened other shops selling lime in Kyoto, was inspired by both the booming business of Hanafuda and his personal taste for the game. He played it regularly and decided to use his skills as a craftsperson to open a factory building handmade Hanafuda decks.[3]
On September 23, 1889, Fusajiro Yamauchi opened Yamauchi Fusajirō Shōten,[5] also known as Yamauchi Nintendo[note 1] (other sources also mention the name Nintendo Koppai[7]), at the location of an unoccupied house he had purchased.[3] Fusajiro crafted the Hanafuda decks using mulberry bark, clay and a wood-block printing machine that he designed himself.[8] The Hanafuda decks sold by Nintendo, known as Daitōryō (i.e President) decks, were recognizable thanks to the illustration of Napoleon that adorned them and became highly successful in Kyoto within a few years.[5][9][10]
In 1890, Nintendo expands its products and starts selling Uta-garuta decks. However, it soon faced challenges in selling its Hanafuda and Uta-garuta due to competition and a shrinking market in its vicinity.[5] Fusajiro then had the idea of using the Hanafuda cards of lesser quality that had been discarded and selling them in new decks called ""Tengu"", which were priced lower than the Daitōryō decks.[5] Additionally, Fusajiro decided to target the clubhouse market. These places never used the same deck twice to prevent cheating, resulting in high deck turnover. In the end, Fusajiro managed to secure contracts with around 70 clubhouses, each using at least 50 decks per night.[10][9]
Just as Hanafuda cards were allowed again in 1885, so too did occidental playing cards (the Standard 52-card deck) become allowed.[9] These western cards, called ‘Trump’ by the Japanese population, truly began to achieve success in 1886.[11] It was by witnessing their popularity and recognizing that they were primarily purchased by the wealthy upper class due to their high prices from exportation that Fusajiro had the idea to produce his own Trump cards instead of importing them.[11]
Although 1907 is most commonly cited as the date when Nintendo started selling their own manufactured western playing cards,[10][11][12] a 1974 presentation flyer by the company cites 1911 as the year when trump decks started being made.[11] Moreover, Nintendo's website lists 1902 as the year ""Mr. Yamauchi started manufacturing the first western-style playing cards in Japan.""[13] According to author Florent Gorges, the date 1902 comes from the website of Watada Insatsujo (Watada Printings), a printing company that still works with Nintendo today and has done so since 1899. Indeed, on their website, it is written (translated): ""1902: Beginning of the prints of ""Trump"" playing cards for Nintendo Koppai.""[14][15]
The decision by Fusajiro to start selling western playing cards made in Japan happened at a fortuitous time for Nintendo. In the same year, the imperial government implemented a new tax on mah-jong and cards producers called the ""Koppai Zei"" or ""Karuta Zei"". This tax of 20 sen, created to prepare for future armed conflicts[16] (the sen is a subdivision of the Japanese yen, which became obsolete in 1954), doubled the price of most Hanafuda decks. These decks were also sold for around 20 sen, leading to more than half of the main producers of Hanafuda cards closing their shops.[16] The western cards served as a lifeline for Nintendo, which was the only company selling these made-in-Japan western cards at the time.[16]
Limited to the Osaka and Kyoto region, Fusajiro had the idea to create a distribution network to expand Nintendo’s operations throughout all of Japan. This was something unheard of at the time, as only drugs and tobacco possessed that kind of distribution.[16]
And so, in 1907, Fusajiro expanded Nintendo’s operations by making a deal with Nihon Senbai[note 2] (now Japan Tobacco) to sell Nintendo cards in cigarette shops throughout all of Japan.[6] By the time of Fusajiro’s retirement in 1929, Nintendo had become the largest playing-card company in Japan.[10]
Without a son, Fusajiro decided to arrange a marriage in 1905[6] between Sekiryō Kaneda, an employee who started working at Nintendo at the beginning of the decade, and one of his two daughters,[17] Tei. Over the next decades, Sekiryō would lead both the Nintendo and Haikyō companies alongside his stepfather until 1929, the year in which Fusajiro retired, and Sekiryō Yamauchi inherited both companies.[6]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibanez,Ibanez,"Ibanez (アイバニーズ, Aibanīzu) is a Japanese guitar brand owned by Hoshino Gakki.[1] Based in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan, Hoshino Gakki was one of the first Japanese musical instrument companies to gain a significant foothold in import guitar sales in the United States and Europe, as well as the first brand of guitars to mass-produce seven-string and eight-string guitars. Ibanez manufactures effects, accessories, amps, and instruments in Japan, China, Indonesia, and the United States (at a Los Angeles-based custom shop). As of 2017[update] they marketed nearly 165 models of bass guitar, 130 acoustic guitars, and more than 300 electric guitars. As of 2024, after Gibson, Fender, and PRS, Ibanez is among the world's most popular and bestselling guitar brands.[2][3]
Daryl Robertson of Guitar World conferred the title of ""the shredder's weapon of choice"" on the Ibanez.[4]
The Hoshino Gakki company began in 1908 as the musical instrument sales division of the Hoshino Shoten, a bookstore chain.  Hoshino Gakki decided in 1935 to make Spanish-style acoustic guitars, at first using the ""Ibanez Salvador"" brand name in honor of Spanish luthier Salvador Ibáñez, and later simply ""Ibanez"".[5] Accordingly, the brand originally was pronounced e-banyesu/e-baniizu (イバニェス/イバニーズ) in Japan, reflecting the Spanish pronunciation, before changing its pronunciation in 1986 to the current name, which represents an English pronunciation of Ibanez.
The modern era of Ibanez guitars began in 1957.[6] The late 1950s and 1960s Ibanez catalogues show guitars with some wild-looking designs,[7] manufactured by Kiso Suzuki Violin,[model 1] Guyatone,[model 2][model 3] and their own Tama factory established in 1962.[5][8] After the Tama factory stopped manufacturing guitars in 1966, Hoshino Gakki contracted the Teisco String Instruments Company to make Ibanez guitars. After the Teisco String Instrument factory closed in 1970, Hoshino Gakki contracted with FujiGen Gakki to make Ibanez guitars.
In the 1960s, Japanese guitar makers mainly copied American guitar designs, and Ibanez-branded copies of Gibson, Fender, and Rickenbacker models appeared. This resulted in the so-called lawsuit period.
As a result of the lawsuit, Hoshino Gakki introduced Ibanez models based on unique designs, such as the Iceman and the Roadstar series. The company has produced its own guitar designs ever since. The late 1980s and early 1990s were an important period for the Ibanez brand. Hoshino Gakki's relationship with guitarist Steve Vai resulted in the introduction of the Ibanez JEM and the Ibanez Universe models; after the earlier successes of the Roadstar and Iceman models in the late 1970s – early 1980s, Hoshino Gakki entered the superstrat market with the RG series, a lower-priced version of their JEM series.
Hoshino Gakki also had semi-acoustic, nylon- and steel-stringed acoustic guitars manufactured under the Ibanez name. Most Ibanez guitars were made by the FujiGen guitar factory in Japan up until the mid- to late 1980s, and from then on Ibanez guitars have also been made in other Asian countries such as Korea, China, and Indonesia. During the early 1980s, the FujiGen guitar factory also produced most of the Roland guitar synthesizers, including the Stratocaster-style Roland G-505, the twin-humbucker Roland G-202 (endorsed by Adrian Belew, Eric Clapton, Dean Brown, Jeff Baxter, Yannis Spathas, Christoforos Krokidis, Steve Howe, Mike Rutherford, Andy Summers, Neal Schon and Steve Hackett) and the Ibanez X-ING IMG-2010.
Cimar and Starfield were guitar and bass brands owned by Hoshino Gakki. In the 1970s, Hoshino Gakki and Kanda Shokai shared some guitar designs, and so some Ibanez and Greco guitars have the same features. The Greco versions were sold in Japan and the Ibanez versions were sold outside Japan. From 1982, Ibanez guitars have also been sold in Japan as well.[9]
Guitar brands such as Antoria and Mann shared some Ibanez guitar designs. The Antoria guitar brand was managed by JT Coppock Leeds Ltd England. CSL was a brand name managed by Charles Summerfield Ltd England. Maurice Summerfield of the Charles Summerfield Ltd company contributed some design ideas to Hoshino Gakki and also imported Ibanez and CSL guitars into the UK from 1964 to 1987.[6] The Maxxas brand name came about because Hoshino Gakki thought that the guitar did not fit in with the Ibanez model range and was therefore named Maxxas by Rich Lasner from Hoshino USA.[10]
Harry Rosenbloom, founder of the (now-closed) Medley Music of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, was manufacturing handmade guitars under the name ""Elger"". By 1965, Rosenbloom had decided to stop manufacturing guitars and chose to become the exclusive North American distributor for Ibanez guitars. In September 1972, Hoshino began a partnership with Elger Guitars to import guitars from Japan.  In September 1981, Elger was renamed ""Hoshino U.S.A."", retaining the company headquarters in Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania as a distribution and quality-control center.
On  June 28, 1977, in the Philadelphia Federal District Court, a lawsuit was filed by the Norlin Corporation, the parent company of Gibson Guitars, against Elger/Hoshino U.S.A.'s use of the Gibson headstock design and logo. Hoshino settled out of court in early 1978 and the case was officially closed on February 2, 1978.[11][12]
After the lawsuit, Hoshino Gakki abandoned the strategy of copying ""classic"" electric guitar designs, having already introduced a plethora of original designs. Hoshino was producing their original Artist models from 1974, introducing a set-neck model in 1975. In 1977, they upgraded and extended their Artist range and introduced a number of other top-quality original designs made to match or surpass famous American brands: the Performer and short-lived Concert ranges, which competed with the Les Paul; through-neck Musicians; Studios in fixed- and through-neck construction; the radically shaped Iceman; and the Roadster which morphed into the Roadstar range, precursor to the popular superstrat era in the mid-1980s. The newer Ibanez models began incorporating more modern elements into their design such as radical body shapes, slimmer necks, 2-octave fingerboards, slim pointed headstocks, higher-output electronics, humbucker/single-coil/humbucker (H/S/H) pickup configurations, locking tremolo bridges and different finishes.
The J. Custom series are the most exclusive and expensive guitars Ibanez offers. They are ""envisioned to be the finest Japanese-made guitar in history"". Built by some of the most skilled luthiers in Japan, they ""represent every advance in design and technology Ibanez has developed over the last 20 years"". As of 2022, they feature Dimarzio pickups, 5 piece maple/wenge necks with Titanium reinforcement rods, ebony fingerboard with a tree of life fret board inlay, and Edge Zero tremolo systems. Even among J. Customs there are two tiers: most of the standard production J. Customs (the ones that appear in catalogs) are produced by FujiGen Gakki while the more limited production models are produced by Sugi Guitars. The Sugi-made models are typically produced in very limited numbers from one-offs to maybe a dozen copies of a single design.
The Prestige guitars are Ibanez's top-of-the-line models that are built in Japan. They feature higher quality materials, high craftsmanship, and higher quality bridges compared to other models.
The Premium guitars are similar to other models but are built in Ibanez's Indonesian premium factory to premium quality standards.
The Ibanez Gio are Ibanez' budget guitars made in China, designed for high playability at low costs. Many high end Ibanez guitars are recreated in the more affordable Gio form, such as the RGA and ART models.
USA custom range. Late 1980s to mid-1990s. Also known as Ibanez LACS (Los Angeles Custom Shop), services only their endorsed artists today.[13]
 The main characteristics that are common among all Ibanez RG guitars (RG stands for Roadstar Guitar[model 4][verification needed]) are that they feature 24 frets and use thin necks, known as ""Wizard"", which allows for faster playing.[model 5] The RG features a line up of guitars with both floating tremolo systems and fixed bridge systems.
The Ibanez RGA was introduced at a time when the Ibanez RG series only had tremolo bridges. Since then, the RG series has introduced fixed bridge models, but Ibanez still produces the RGA series with an arched top to differentiate from the RG series. The arched top allows for added comfort while playing the guitar.[model 6]
The Ibanez RGD guitar was developed for heavy metal guitar players.[model 7] The RGD features a 26.5"" scale which allows for lower than standard guitar tuning while retaining standard string tension without use of thicker gauge strings. It also features an extra deep scoop cut on the lower horn for easy high fret access. Ibanez currently makes two Ibanez RGD Prestige models.
The Ibanez S (Saber[model 8][verification needed]) guitar has an extremely thin body made out of mahogany, and is available in 6, 7 and 8-string models. They may come with either 22 or 24 frets, depending on year of manufacture. The standard line currently have Wizard III necks that are slightly wider and thicker than the original Wizard. All S models have bodies that are thicker in the middle where the pickups are, and taper off towards the outer edges. The guitars use ZR (Zero Resistance), Lo-TRS, and variants of the Edge bridge system as well as fixed bridges.[model 8] Ibanez currently makes 8 Prestige S-Series guitars.
 The Ibanez Q was released in June 2021[14] as its new headless guitar series, with 6- and 7-string models and a 25.5"" scale length. They feature a small nyatoh body and a new bridge developed by Ibanez, the Mono-Tune. Along with a 5-way blade switch, there is a 2-way Alter Switch, which gives another 5 different pickup combinations. The QX variation has slanted frets – ordinary frets inclined at a 8 degree angle. They're made exclusively in Indonesia.
The Ibanez DN guitar (DN stands for Darkstone[model 9]) was developed for heavy metal guitar players. The main features of the DN are that it has a set-in neck for speed and playing comfort, medium frets, and coil tapped pickups. This guitar is currently discontinued.
The Ibanez X guitars are Ibanez guitars that feature unconventional and unique body designs. An example would be the Ibanez Xiphos, which is stylized to look like the letter X.[model 10]
The Ibanez Artist guitars were designed for heavy playing such as for heavy metal or traditional rock. The Artist ARZ is a single cutaway, 24 fret, 25"" scale guitar that features a wide variety of bridges and pickups depending on the specific models.[model 11] The Artist ART is a single cutaway, 22 fret, 24.75"" scale guitar that features a hard tail bridge.[model 12][verification needed] The Ibanez AR is a reissued series originating from the 70s. The AR series features a set-in neck, double cutaway, with 22 frets on a 24.75"" scale.[model 13]
The Ibanez FR is a simple body type guitar that is designed to be played in many genres.[model 14]
The Ibanez Mikro series are small form factor[when defined as?] guitars designed for children, beginners, or guitar players looking for a guitar that is easy to transport.[model 15]
The first Ibanez Artcore models were released in mid-2002 whose goal was to offer an affordable range of full-hollow and semi-hollow body guitars that appealed to entry level guitarists who were unable or unwilling to pay big money on high-priced guitars.
The Artcore Custom is Ibanez's flagship model for the Artcore series. The bodies of the guitars are made of maple, the neck has a set-in construction type, and features wood control knobs and hand rolled frets.[model 16]
The Ibanez AK is a guitar designed for jazz and blues type playing. It features a slim set-in neck with a body designed to easily access the higher frets.[model 17] The AK is easily distinguishable by its sharper lower body horn (Florentine cutaway) that other Artcore guitars do not have.[clarification needed]
Middle-class model range in the new millennium, though it included expensive high-end and top-of-the-line Japanese models in the late 1980s and 1990s. Later top offerings were branded as Signature and SR Prestige models for clearer segmentation, and all non-Prestige model production moved outside Japan.  Current models from the SR250 and up feature soap bar-style humbuckers with active EQ.
High-end versions of the Ibanez Soundgear (SR-5004/5/6 & SR-4004/5/6) Bass Guitars made in Japan using exotic woods and high-quality custom Bartolini pickups & new ""PWC-III"" Power Curve III 3-band EQ with EQ bypass switch to bypass the electronics and take the bass signal directly from the pickups to the output jack. All Japanese-built current production models are in the Prestige series.
Nordstrand pickups. Indonesian-built.
In the 1970s, the Nisshin Onpa company who owned the Maxon brand name, developed and began selling a series of effect pedals in Japan. Hoshino Gakki licensed these for sale using the name Ibanez outside Japan. These two companies eventually began doing less and less business together until Nisshin Onpa ceased manufacturing the TS-9 reissue for Hoshino Gakki in 2002.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMore,Apple community,"
The Apple community consists of the users, media, and third party companies interested in Apple Inc. and its products. They discuss rumors, future products, news stories, and support of Apple's products. Apple has a devoted following, especially for the Apple II, Mac, iPod, iPhone, and luminary staff members. The personal computer revolution, mixed with Apple's vertical integration of its products and services,[1] has increased popularity. Apple's corporate policy of extreme secrecy about future products intensify interest in the company's activities.
Before the popular use of the internet, early Apple-related publications were available in traditional print media form, often but not always moving later to online publication.
MacLife (stylized as Mac|Life) is a San Francisco-based American publication, originally known as MacAddict between September 1996 and February 2007.  Published by Future US, it started as a monthly magazine, focusing on the Macintosh personal computer and other related Apple products. While originally a print publication, it is now exclusively a digital–only product, or available through their app which can be obtained via the App Store.[2]
MacUser is a print magazine that was published biweekly and then monthly by Dennis Publishing Ltd. and licensed by Felden in the UK. Its content is for Mac users in the design sector, with its Masterclass tutorials and technical advice. It began publishing in 1985, ceasing publication in 2015.[3] In 1985, Felix Dennis's Dennis Publishing, the creators of MacUser in the UK, licensed its name and mouse-rating symbol to Ziff-Davis Publishing for use worldwide as a completely separate publication, later consolidated into Macworld.[4]
Macworld is one of the oldest magazine publications focused on Apple products and software, starting in 1984. It received competition with the launch of the US version of  MacUser magazine the following year. The two magazines merged as Macworld in 1997. In September 2014, it discontinued its print edition, instead focusing on its website and YouTube coverage.[5]
9to5Mac[6] was founded in 2007 by Seth Weintraub as an Apple news website originally focused on Macs in the enterprise. Since then, the website has expanded to covering all things Apple. 9to5Mac is known as the leading website within the Apple News Community in terms of breaking impactful news.[7] The site gained fame in its earlier years for publishing the first photos of the third-generation iPod nano, the original iPod touch, early photos of the first iPhone, and details about Apple's still-in-use aluminum manufacturing process for laptops. In recent years, 9to5Mac published the first accurate details about the iPhone 4S, Siri, Apple's move from Google Maps to Apple Maps, new health and fitness applications, OS X/macOS updates, and the Apple Watch. The site also published the first photos of the white iPad 2, iPhone 5, and the iPad Air.[8]
AppleInsider launched in 1997 as a news and rumor website for Apple products and services at appleinsider.com. It includes a forum for discussion of news stories and other community news. In the late 1990s, Apple successfully sued John Doe from AppleInsider's boards with the username ""Worker Bee"" for revealing information on what became the Apple Pro Mouse. It is a rare case of Apple following through on threats of a suit. The case was settled out of court.[9]
iMore was an Apple-enthusiast website founded in 2008, previously as Phonedifferent, with its main focus on all aspects of Apple devices (also featuring sections on several other platforms). Gerald Lynch was the final editor in chief.[10] It was run by editor-in-chief Rene Ritchie with a small editing staff until 2020; Joseph Keller was the editor until mid-2022.[11] Along with the usual news and rumors, iMore often featured in-depth technical details of Apple software and operating systems, aimed at explaining to readers how and why certain things have been done by Apple, in their wider context of achieving better usability and design goals.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18] It ceased publication and closed its member forums on November 1, 2024.[19]
Low End Mac is an Apple-centric website founded in 1997 to support Mac users with early Mac hardware and growing over time to cover the entire range of Macs, as each line eventually had model years falling into the “vintage and obsolete” category. Low End Mac's primary focus is on aging Apple gear, primarily Macs, but touching on iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple TV, and other devices as well.[20] It is published by its founder Daniel Knight with a small volunteer writing staff.[21]
MacDailyNews launched in September 2002.[22] MacDailyNews was cited by CNet as its source for the launch of the first Verizon (CDMA-capable) iPhone after Christmas, 2010;[23] the phone was announced by Verizon in early 2011.[24] It was cited by MacRumors with a forecast for the second generation Mac Pro in April 2013;[25] Apple announced it in June.[26]
MacOS Rumors was founded by Ethan C. Allen in 1995 as the first known ""Apple rumors"" website on the early web. His early work was noticed and referenced by other print media including CNET,[27] Forbes,[28] and Mac the Knife in MacWEEK. Allen was only 16 at the time but had developed extensive source contacts. Apple was unhappy with some of the releases on the site which proved to be early and accurate. Apple requested several times that he stop releasing data from his sources. After a brief shutdown of the site at the request of Apple, MacOS Rumors was obtained by Ryan Meader after a domain expiration within two years of its creation. Originally with Ethan, the site posted most of its rumors based on screenshots and info sent via email from followers. With Ryan at the helm, MacOS Rumors collected content from message boards and Usenet posts but later claimed (unsubstantiated) to have developed contacts inside Apple. After several successful years, MacOS Rumors gained a reputation for being inaccurate.[29] After the MacOS Rumors site was obtained by Ryan in 1997, Ethan tried to briefly return to Apple rumors with his sources by creating a new website titled Mac Rumor Mill. Apple quickly caught onto the new site and was able to shut it down with threatened legal action.[30]
MacRumors was launched in February 2000 by Arnold Kim, as an aggregator of Mac-related rumors and reports around the web. MacRumors attempts to keep track of the rumor community by consolidating reports and cross-referencing claims, along with having extensive online forums for most Apple products and services.[31]
SecureMac was founded in 1999 as a Mac-oriented security news portal. The site has expanded to cover a wide range of digital security and privacy topics, but has retained its focus on Apple products and software.

SecureMac has been credited with discovering several significant macOS threats, including the Boonana Trojan,[33] a new variant of the rogue security program Mac Defender.[34]
Think Secret launched in 1999. Apple filed a lawsuit against the company alleging it printed stories containing Apple trade secrets.[35] In December 2007, the lawsuit was settled with no sources being disclosed; however, the site was shut down, finally closing on February 14, 2008.[36] In the year leading up to the closing of the site, Think Secret correctly predicted an aluminum shell iMac, development of a touchscreen based iPod starting in 2006, and the relative BlackBerry-esque form factor of the new iPod Nano. However, there were still some reports that turned out to be false, such as its prediction of the demise of the Mac Mini, when it received an upgrade in mid-2007.[37]
TidBITS[38] was founded by Adam Engst and Tonya Engst in April 1990,[39] making it the oldest online Apple publication and the second-oldest Internet publication. TidBITS covers Apple news and publishes detailed technical advice for users. It started as an email newsletter before the rise of the Web, began publishing on the Web in 1994,[40] and continues to provide information via both the Web and weekly email distribution.
The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW) was founded in 2004, and claimed to be ""a resource for all things Apple and beyond"". TUAW published news stories, credible rumors, and how-tos covering a variety of topics daily.[41] TUAW was known for its rumor roundups, seeking to dispel false Apple rumors from around the web. On February 3, 2015, TUAW was shut down by its owners, Weblogs, Inc.[42] In July 2024, its domain name was sold to ad agency Web Orange Limited (WOL) and was reused as an AI-generated content farm.[43]
The Mac Observer publishes Mac, iPhone, and Apple related news, reviews, tips, and podcasts. The site was launched on December 29, 1998, by Dave Hamilton and Bryan Chaffin. The site has evolved from just providing news and reviews to now hosting popular podcasts, columns, and more.[citation needed]
Macintosh User Groups (MUGs) are groups of Macintosh users, that started after the 1985 creation of the Apple User Group Connection (AUGC).
Former Macintosh division lead Jean-Louis Gassée, a Frenchman, was an advocate in France for personal computing, and contributed to Apple's ""remarkable"" success in that country.[44]
Until 2007, the Apple Expo trade show was held yearly in Paris, and attended by Apple to hold several keynotes.[45]
French Apple news sites include Mac4Ever, MacBidouille, MacGeneration, and MacPlus.[46]
In 1996, Macworld bought Golden magazine, and renamed it Macworld France. Two years later, it was renamed Univers Macworld after merging with the Univers Mac magazine; in 2003, the French version of the magazine changed its name to Macworld.[47][48][49] Bernard Le Du, a French Macworld journalist, later started his own magazine, Vous et votre Mac.[50][51] Àvosmac is another notable French magazine, which went online-only in 2017.[52]
We worked with at least two or three of the Apple evangelists along the way, and that was a very different experience for us. We hadn’t realized that technology could be a secular religion ... Believe me, if you haven't contacted the Mac zealots, you haven't lived. It's literally a secular religion, and they are deadly serious. They've forgotten it’s a computer program somewhere along the line.— Dave Fulton of Fox Software, 1988[53]An Apple evangelist is a technology evangelist for Apple products. The term ""software evangelist"" was coined by Mike Murray of the Macintosh division.[54] Apple's first evangelist was Mike Boich, a member of the original Macintosh development team.[55] Alain Rossmann succeeded him. Their job was to promote Apple products, primarily by working with third-party developers. Boich and Rossmann later cofounded Radius.
One prominent Apple evangelist is Apple Fellow Guy Kawasaki. He is credited as one of the first to use evangelism marketer of a computer platform through a weblog.[56][57] Apple formerly had a ""Why Mac?"" evangelist site.[citation needed] The company subsequently ran Get a Mac, which gave numerous reasons why ""PC users"" should switch to Macs. Several third-parties still host and maintain Apple evangelism websites, many of which are listed above. The AppleMasters program was a similar endeavor in the late nineties.[58]
In the early days of the Macintosh computer, the primary function of an evangelist was to convince software developers to write software products for the Macintosh. When software developers need help from within Apple, evangelists will often act as go-betweens, helping the developers to find the right people at Apple to talk to. This role is now filled by the Apple Developer program, led by Phil Schiller.
Apple's official stance on speculation around future product releases is to refrain from discussing any products or outside speculation until release.[59] Historically, Apple has often used legal means, such as cease and desist orders, in order to retain trade secrets, intellectual property, or confidential corporate information, when needed. Typically, Apple has primarily pursued the leakers of information themselves, rather than any sites containing rumors on their products.[citation needed] However, Apple's suit against Think Secret in 2005 targeted whether these sites have the right to knowingly publish this protected information.[60] Staff are also required to sign non-disclosure clauses within the company.
During his January 10, 2006, keynote address to the Macworld Conference & Expo in San Francisco, Apple CEO Steve Jobs lampooned the rumor community by pretending to create a ""Super Secret Apple Rumors"" podcast during his demonstration of new features in GarageBand.[61]
On October 16, 2014, at an Apple Special Event keynote, Craig Federighi pretended to ""triple down on secrecy"" by hiring Stephen Colbert as Supreme Commander of Secrecy. He lampooned the ""spaceship"" rumors.[62]

In April 2023, UK wealth manager Rathbones agreed to buy Investec's wealth and investment businesses in the UK and Channel Islands for £839 million. Under the deal terms, Investec Group owns 41% of Rathbones.[23] The deal excluded Investec Bank (Switzerland) and Investec International wealth business.[24]
In September 2025, Investec announced that it had become one of the first major banks in South Africa to enter the electricity market, after the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) granted it a trading license.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Data_Group,International Data Group,"International Data Group (IDG, Inc.)[1] is an American market intelligence and demand generation company[2] focused on the technology industry. IDG, Inc.'s mission is centered around supporting the technology industry through research, data, marketing technology, and insights that help create and sustain relationships between businesses.[3]
IDG, Inc. is wholly owned by Blackstone[4] and is led by Genevieve Juillard, who was appointed CEO of the company in 2023.[5]  Juillard serves on IDG, Inc.'s leadership team along with IDC President Crawford Del Prete and IDG, Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer Tiziana Figliolia.[6]
IDG, Inc. is headquartered in Needham, Massachusetts,[7] and is the parent company of both International Data Corporation (IDC) and Foundry (formerly IDG Communications).[3][8]
International Data Group was initially founded as International Data Corporation (IDC) in 1964 by Patrick Joseph McGovern, shortly after he had graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Based in Massachusetts, the company produced a computer installation database, and published a newsletter, ""EDP Industry and Market Report"" (modeled on ""ADP Newsletter"", which was published by the Diebold Group). Companies such as RCA, Univac, Xerox, and Burroughs paid IDC for use of the data base. During this time, McGovern continued to work as a writer for ""Computers and Automation"" magazine, the first computer magazine, published by Edmund Berkeley.[citation needed]
By IDG's third year, McGovern was considering liquidating the company when he hit on the idea of launching Computerworld in 1967,[9] which was a continuation of the monthly newsletter, published weekly instead of monthly, in a different format, with advertising, and which would become a cornerstone of IDG's subsequent publishing arm.[10]
In 1969, IDG made its first overseas expansion when it opened IDC UK and launched its first European publication. In 1974, the company launched its first international publication, Computerwoche, in Germany, its first fully translated publication. International publications in Japan, China, the then Soviet Union, Vietnam, and other countries would follow throughout the 1990s.[11]
In 1984, the company launched MacWorld in the same week that the Macintosh computer was debuted, and featured Steve Jobs on its cover. In the 1991, IDG Books launched its For Dummies series with DOS For Dummies,[12] and published many instructional/reference books under the series until Hungry Minds (the new name for IDG Books) was acquired by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. in 2001.[13]
In 2007, IDG ceased print publication of InfoWorld U.S. and made the content available online only, signaling the company's transition to a web-centric model for publication.[14]
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, IDG would break into the events and research spaces. In the early 1970s, it launched its Computer Caravan trade show in the US, reaching nine US cities in 11 weeks.[15] By 1972, the Computer Caravan had a European presence as well.[16]
In the 1980s, IDG launched IDC Predictions via its subsidiary IDC, which would come to represent the company's technology research and analyst arm.[15] The company still maintains an IDC Predictions team of analysts today that publish regular findings on the state of the worldwide technology industry.[17]
In 1991, the first IDG DEMO Conference was held in La Quinta, California, as a live forum where companies could debut their latest technology live on stage in front of crowds of technology consumers, business decision makers, and investors. The event, which would go on to be held as conferences across the US, Asia, South America, and other countries through 2015, served as the site of notable product and software launches such as Adobe Acrobat, PalmPilot, VMware Virtual Hardware, Netscape, and Salesforce.[18]
By the mid-2000s, the company had established a rich online and print publication business, a trusted market research and analyst division, and a large global trade show presence – all which contributed to the growth of a database of over six million technology buyers and professionals. In 2006, IDG made this database of readers, website visitors, and event attendees available to technology marketers via its demand generation division IDG Connect.[19] In 2010, IDG introduced the ""Nanosite"", an advertising tool designed as an alternative to a microsite.[20]
Following McGovern's death in 2014, ownership of the corporate passed to the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation,[21] until 2017 when it was purchased by China Oceanwide Holdings Group.[22] IDG, Inc. changed ownership again in May 2021 when Blackstone Inc. acquired the corporation from China Oceanwide Holdings Group for $1.3 billion.[23]
IDG, Inc. serves as the parent company of two major company divisions, IDC and Foundry.[24]
IDC is a wholly owned subsidiary of IDG, Inc. and is a global provider of market intelligence, advisory services, and events for the information technology, telecommunications, and consumer technology markets.[25] IDC employs over 2,500 people globally including more than 1,300 analysts worldwide to offer expertise and insights on technology and industry trends.[26]
In 2019, Crawford Del Prete was named president of IDC after serving as its Chief Operating Officer (COO).[27]
In May 2021, IDC acquired Dutch IT intelligence consultancy Metri,[28] bolstering its presence in the Benelux region and strengthening IDC's reach and insight into Europe's IT industry.
Foundry was a wholly owned subsidiary of IDG, Inc. and is a global provider of media & event services, marketing technology, and intent data for B2B technology marketers. Formerly known as IDG Communications, the IDG Inc. subsidiary company rebranded from IDG Communications to Foundry in February 2022 as part of its strategic transformation from publisher to data and martech company.[29] Foundry employs over 1,400 people globally[30] and operates in over 140 countries around the world.[31]
Between 2020 and 2022, Foundry acquired leading data and marketing technology (MarTech) companies Triblio, Kickfire, Leadsift, and Selling Simplified as part of its strategy to transform from legacy media network to integrated marketing technology and data provider.[32]
In March 2025, Foundry was sold to private equity firm Regent LP.[33][34]
Foundry owns and operates various editorial brands that publish content for technology buyers in both the B2B and consumer spaces across over 90 countries.[35] With some like Computerworld and MacWorld dating back to McGovern's early ownership, the editorial brands remain central to Foundry's operations in media and technology marketing, though many of the editorial brands have transitioned from print to digital.[36]
In 2000, Salesforce was launched at IDG's DEMO Event the premier launch venue for new technologies from 1991 to 2015.[citation needed]. The same year, Fortune magazine named IDG, Inc. to its list of ""The 100 Best Companies to Work For"", ranking the company at number 58.[48]
IDG Books launched the popular reference book series For Dummies in 1991, which it owned for 10 years until selling to John Wiley & Sons, Inc. in 2001.[49]
The first ever iPhone was revealed by Steve Jobs at a MacWorld conference in 2007.[50]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_AM2,Sega AM2,"
Sega AM Research & Development No. 2,[a] previously known as SEGA-AM2 Co., Ltd.,[b] is a video game development team within the Japanese multinational video game developer Sega. Yu Suzuki, who had previously developed arcade games for Sega including Hang-On and Out Run, was the first manager of the department.
AM2's first game produced was 1992's Virtua Racing, followed by the highly popular Virtua Fighter and Daytona USA. Through the remainder of the 1990s, they developed more arcade titles and focused on fighting and racing games. AM2 was placed under the management of CSK Research Institute in 2000, and a year later became SEGA-AM2 Co., Ltd. Their development of Shenmue was over budget and cost millions of dollars, and despite positive reviews and good sales was unable to become profitable.
Suzuki was promoted and left AM2 in 2003; Hiroshi Kataoka became the head of AM2. A year later Sega was acquired by Sammy Corporation and AM2 was merged back into Sega. Since, the team has continued work on arcade games such as Border Break and the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series, as well as smartphone games in Japan. Several games produced by Sega AM2 have influenced and innovated the video game industry from a technical and developmental perspective.
Yu Suzuki joined Sega in 1983 as a programmer.[1] At the time Suzuki joined Sega, there was only one development division at the company.[2] In his first year, he created a 2D boxing game called Champion Boxing for Sega's first home game console, the SG-1000. According to Suzuki, the executive staff at Sega found the game so impressive that they released it in arcades as-is by simply installing an SG-1000 into an arcade cabinet. He was promoted to project leader while still in his first year at the company.[1] Suzuki's next project was the motorcycle racing game Hang-On. To accomplish his desire to make a 3D game despite technological limitations at the time,[3] he specified the design of Sega's new Super Scaler arcade system board,[4] which utilized 16-bit graphics and sprite-scaling.[5][6] Hang-On was very popular at launch and sold well for Sega.[4] Suzuki's success followed with additional titles Space Harrier, Out Run, and Enduro Racer.[4][7] He and his team relocated to ""Studio 128"", a more private location where After Burner and Power Drift were developed.[8] He also worked on development of G-LOC: Air Battle and the R360 arcade cabinet.[2] Developer Toshihiro Nagoshi joined Sega in 1989 as a designer with Suzuki's team.[9]
Some time after the release of Power Drift, Sega began to separate the amusement division into the Amusement Machine Research and Development teams, or AM teams. Suzuki was made general manager of Research and Development No. 2, or Sega AM2.[8][2] According to Suzuki, Sega employed approximately 600 people in research and development, and that AM2 began as a group of around 100 people. He has also stated the reason for this separation was the advent of advanced computer graphics technology.[2] Around the time of AM2's formation, Suzuki's team moved back into the main office, then to an annex a short walk from the office. Even so, Suzuki worked with a desire of secrecy, so much so that Sega president Hayao Nakayama was denied entry on one occasion.[8]
The first project developed by AM2 was Virtua Racing. While development began with 10 people on Virtua Racing, it finished with 25 workers on the project for a year, and the Model 1 arcade system board on which it runs took approximately three years. AM2 also ported the game for the Sega Genesis.[2] Next Generation stated that AM2 ""single-handedly chang[ed] the perception of polygons in a gaming environment"" with Virtua Racing.[10]
After the release of Virtua Racing, AM2 split into two teams; one began work on Virtua Fighter, while another started on Daytona USA.[2] According to Suzuki, he wanted to develop a game with multiple joint movements, such as a soccer or rugby game. Finding that the Model 1 was not powerful enough to handle this many motions, Suzuki resorted to a game with only two moving characters at a time. With the massive success of Street Fighter II in the industry at the time, he made the decision to make a 3D fighting game to compete.[11] In developing the game, Suzuki identified the need for the game to be realistic, yet fun to play.[12] Virtua Fighter became a huge success in Japan,[13] and its Sega Saturn port sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio with the console itself.[14]
For Daytona USA, Nagoshi was director and chief designer, while Suzuki served as producer. The concept for the game was suggested by Tom Petit, head of Sega Enterprises USA, as a way to debut Sega's new Model 2 arcade system board. Sega mandated that Daytona USA had to be better than Ridge Racer, a game made by Namco. To accurately depict Daytona International Speedway, the developers used satellite imagery and sent staff to photograph the track; Nagoshi walked a full lap to get a feel for the banking in the corners.[15] Daytona USA was released in Japan in August 1993, and worldwide in March 1994.[15][16] AM2 ported the game to Saturn in April 1995.[17][18] The Saturn port was a launch title in the West.[19][20] Daytona USA was highly popular in arcades, and the twin cabinet was one of three 1995 recipients of the American Amusement Machine Association's Diamond Awards, which are based strictly on sales achievements.[21] In a 2002 report, Sega reported it to be one of the most successful arcade games of all time.[22]
Over the course of the remainder of the 1990s, Suzuki's primary concern in arcades were the Virtua Fighter series and working as a producer for other titles.[23] Subsequently, AM2 released Virtua Cop and Virtua Fighter 2 for the Model 2.[24] Produced in twelve months, Virtua Fighter 2 was an even greater success in Japan than its predecessor.[10] In a 1996 interview, Suzuki stated in an interview his philosophy to be not an imitator, but a pioneer in the arcade industry. He also described the palm tree logo of AM2 as representing reliance and peace of mind.[25] Further titles developed in the end of 1990s included Virtua Cop 2, Fighting Vipers, Daytona USA 2: Battle on the Edge, and SpikeOut. Daytona USA 2 and SpikeOut made use of the Model 3 system board.[26]
In April 2000, CSK Research Institute (CRI) took management over AM2. CRI was a subsidiary of CSK Corporation, which was Sega's parent company at the time, and had previously published Aero Dancing. The new division became known as ""AM2 of CRI"", and Suzuki remained in charge.[27]  Also in 2000, Sega restructured its arcade and console development teams into nine semi-autonomous studios headed by the company's top designers.[5][28] Sega's design houses were encouraged to experiment and benefited from a relatively lax approval process.[29]  During the development of Shenmue, Nagoshi requested and was granted his own studio, leaving AM2.[30]

AM2 developed what Sega hoped would be the Dreamcast's killer app in Shenmue, a ""revenge epic in the tradition of Chinese cinema.""[5][31] The action-adventure game involved the quest of protagonist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father's murder,[32] but its main selling point was its rendition of the Japanese city of Yokosuka, which included a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game.[33] Incorporating a simulated day/night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects (also introducing the Quick-time event in its modern form[33][34]), Shenmue went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million.[32][33][35] Originally planned as the first installment in an 11-part saga, Shenmue was eventually downsized to a trilogy.[5][36] According to Sega of America president Peter Moore, Shenmue sold ""extremely well"", but the game had no chance of making a profit due to the Dreamcast's limited installed base.[37] The high amount Shenmue went over budget was also a factor in the game's lack of profitability.[23] Its sequel, Shenmue II, ""was completed for a much more reasonable sum"".[38][35]In addition to the mixed reception for Shenmue, IGN's Travis Fahs stated that ""the [Dreamcast] era wasn't as kind to [AM2] as earlier years""—citing (among others) F355 Challenge as an ""acclaimed"" arcade game that ""didn't do much at home"", and Genki's port of Virtua Fighter 3 as inferior to the arcade version, ""which was already a couple years old and never as popular as its predecessors.""[38][39][40] The Virtua Fighter series would experience a ""tremendous comeback"" with the universally acclaimed Virtua Fighter 4—which saw a console release exclusively on PlayStation 2.[38][41] In Japanese arcades, Virtua Fighter 4 proved to be highly influential with its VF.NET system, paving the way for arcade games with network features.[42] The quest mode of Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution on PlayStation 2, used AI mined from players in Japan playing through VF.NET.[43]
In 2001, AM2 of CRI was renamed to SEGA-AM2 Co., Ltd.[44] After serving as a producer on Virtua Cop 3 and OutRun 2,[23] Suzuki left AM2 on October 1, 2003, in order to start a new studio with Sega, called Digitalrex.[45][46]  He was promoted to non-executive board director.[45]  Hiroshi Kataoka was placed in charge of AM2.[45][47]  Kataoka, who had led research and development at AM2 for a year, had worked on numerous projects for Sega and Yu Suzuki's division as old as Space Harrier to Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution.[48] Makoto Osaki became AM2's head of development, reporting to Kataoka.[49]  At the same time as the changes, a number of Sega's studios were merged.  However, AM2 did not merge with any other studio.[45][50]
During mid-2004, Sammy Corporation bought a controlling share in Sega and created the new company Sega Sammy Holdings, an entertainment conglomerate. Since then, Sega and Sammy became subsidiaries of the aforementioned holding company, with both companies operating independently, while the executive departments merged.[51] Prior to the acquisition by Sammy, Sega began the process of re-integrating its subsidiaries into the main company,[52] which was completed by October 2004.[53]  Sega would also restructure the development studios again, consolidating the divisions further into the Global Entertainment, Amusement Software, and New Entertainment R&D divisions.[54]
AM2 continued to develop games after the merger. Virtua Fighter 5 was released in 2007.[55] An upgrade, Virtua Fighter 5 R, was released the following year.[56] The last release of the Virtua Fighter franchise was the console port of Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown, the final iteration of the game.[57] Ghost Squad, in the style of Virtua Cop, received an arcade and a Wii release in 2008.[58][59] AM2 has developed games for the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series, as well as a number of free-to-play smartphone games in Japan,[60] such as Soul Reverse Zero.[61] Some titles have been developed for consoles as well, such as Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Mega 39’s for Nintendo Switch.[62] AM2 became involved with the Hatsune Miku license with items for Virtua Fighter 5 R and the racing game R-Tuned: Ultimate Street Racing. When the PSP game Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA was in development, it was decided that AM2 would develop an arcade version as well as develop the holographic imagery for Hatsune Miku's live concerts. The visuals for these projects were based on the Virtua Fighter 5 engine. Makoto Osaki called this period the most stressful for him since Shenmue.[63]
A major success for AM2 has been the Border Break franchise. The game was partly developed because the development team felt envious of the Virtua Fighter 5 team and wanted to develop a competitive game as well. The arcade release in 2009 was continuously updated, with releases Border Break Union in 2012, Border Break Scramble in 2015, and Border Break X in 2017—with a PlayStation 4 version released in 2018. In 2019, Border Break celebrated its 10th Anniversary.[64] Other titles from AM2 to get long-term support in arcades are Quest of D,[65] Sega Network Taisen Mahjong MJ,[66] and Shining Force Cross.[67] Hiroshi Kataoka likened the basic enjoyability of these network-based arcade games to those of an MMO, but collectible cards and a community differentiated these from the usually solitary MMO experience on PC.[68] According to Sega Amusement International CEO Paul Williams, these types of core games are only possible in Japan due to Sega owning their own chains and being able to kickstart an online infrastructure.[69] The latest effort, Soul Reverse, was born out of the desire to create a fantasy version of Border Break.[70] It lasted a year, launching in 2018 with its network features shutting down in 2019.[71] The game was not well received by the Japanese arcade player base. It took four years to produce.[72] Currently running arcade games with AM2 staff working on them are KanColle Arcade,[73] Fate/Grand Order Arcade[74][75] as well as an updated version of Virtua Fighter 5, Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown, co-developed with Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.[76]
As of 2014, Hiroshi Kataoka was still in charge of AM2.[77] Currently he is an executive for Sega supervising arcade engineers and the technology backend of games developed at the engineering division.[78][79]
AM2 has several arcade and video game series they develop, including Daytona USA, Virtua Fighter, OutRun, Virtua Cop, Virtua Striker, Fighting Vipers, and Shenmue.[23][24][26] Other titles developed by the studio include Scud Race,[80] Sonic the Fighters,[26] 18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker,[81] F355 Challenge,[39] Outtrigger,[82] and Soul Reverse.[83]  AM2 has also developed smartphone games in Japan.[60]  Of AM2's games, the Virtua Fighter series is ""the highest grossing game in Japan arcades.""[55]  The Hatsune Miku: Project Diva series has sold over 6 million units as of 2018.[84] As of March 2012, the game Border Break has grossed JP¥8.1 billion from arcade machine sales, equivalent to more than US$100 million.[85]
Journalists have praised AM2 as having a ""legendary"" status in game development, in particular under Yu Suzuki.  According to Aaron Souppouris of Engadget, AM2 in the past developed games that defined their genres, and called the department Sega's ""most-storied division"".  While lamenting the changes in development focus in recent years, Souppouris called the Hatsune Miku series ""admittedly excellent"".[60]  In 1995, Edge called Suzuki ""the legendary head of AM2, Sega's core coin-op operation"".[2]  Also in 1995, Next Generation stated that AM2's unusual repeated success came from its ability to release high-quality games on a regular basis.[10] IGN's Travis Fahs stated that ""[f]or as long as SEGA has had internal studios, AM2 has been the favorite son of the arcade division... Without AM2, SEGA would not have been able to dominate the arcades the way that they did.""[38] Video game researcher Ken Horowitz has stated that AM2 became the most well-known of Sega's in-house development teams and that the studio produced ""ground-breaking classics"".[8]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtua_Fighter,Virtua Fighter,"Virtua Fighter[nb 1] is a series of fighting games created by Sega AM2 and designer Yu Suzuki. The original Virtua Fighter was released in December 1993[1] and has received four main sequels and several spin-offs. The highly influential first Virtua Fighter game is widely recognized as the first 3D fighting game released.
The default gameplay system of the Virtua Fighter series involves two combatants needing to win two of three rounds, with each round being 30 seconds long or more. Combatants utilize various attacks in an attempt to deplete the other fighter's stamina gauge and deal a knockout (K.O.), winning a round. If a character is knocked out (or falls out) of the ring, their opponent wins the round in a Ring Out. An extra round is necessary if a double knockout (both players knocking each other out at the same time) occurs in a previous round and the match is tied one round each. In this round, players fight on a small stage wherein one hit is enough to knock the other out and achieve victory.
The basic control scheme uses an 8-way control stick and three buttons (Punch, Kick, Guard). Through various timings, positions, and button combinations, players input normal and special moves for each character. This allows extensive lists of moves to exist for a given character within the limited control scheme. Traditionally, in the single-player mode, the player runs a gauntlet of characters in the game (which may include one's doppelgänger) all the way to the final boss.
The following is a list of games in the Virtua Fighter series:
R.E.V.O.:Windows (2025), PlayStation 5 (2025), Xbox Series X/S (2025), Nintendo Switch 2 (TBD)[5]
The brainchild of Sega AM2's Yu Suzuki, Virtua Fighter was released in 1993 as an arcade game using hardware jointly developed by aerospace simulation technology by the company that is now known as Lockheed Martin and Sega's most prominent and well known studio AM2, originally crafted for the arcade system dubbed the Model 1.[8] It is considered the first polygon-based fighting game. It introduced the eight initial fighters as well as the boss, Dural. Sony developers have confirmed that the game inspired Sony to create the first PlayStation console and to focus more on 3D games, more so than the main competitor in Japan, the Sega Saturn.
Virtua Fighter 2 was released in November 1994, adding two new fighters: Shun Di and Lion Rafale. It was built using the Model 2 hardware, rendering characters and backgrounds with filtered texture mapping and motion capture.[9] A slightly tweaked upgrade, Virtua Fighter 2.1, followed soon after.
Virtua Fighter 3 came out in 1996, with the introduction of Taka-Arashi and Aoi Umenokoji. Aside from improving the graphics via use of the Model 3 (such as mipmapping, multi-layer anti-aliasing, trilinear filtering and specular highlighting), the game also introduced undulations in some stages and a fourth button, Dodge. Virtua Fighter 3tb in 1997 was the first major update in series history, implementing tournament battles featuring more than two characters (though not simultaneously as in the Dead or Alive games and Tekken Tag Tournament).
Virtua Fighter 4, which introduced Vanessa Lewis and Lei-Fei and removed Taka-Arashi, was released on the NAOMI 2 hardware in 2001 instead of hardware from a joint collaboration with Lockheed Martin. The game also removed the uneven battlegrounds and the Dodge button from the previous game. The title is consistently popular in its home arcade market. Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution, released in 2002, was the first update to add new characters, these being Brad Burns and Goh Hinogami. Virtua Fighter 4: Final Tuned, an upgrade to Evolution, was released in the arcades in 2004. In Japan, Virtua Fighter 4 was famous for spearheading and opening the market for internet functionality in arcades. VF.NET started in Japan in 2001, and since companies have created their own arcade networks, E-Amusement by Konami, NESiCAxLive by Taito and Square Enix, and ALL.Net by Sega.
Virtua Fighter 5 was released in Japan on July 12, 2006, for Sega's Lindbergh arcade board and introduced yet two more new characters, Eileen and El Blaze. Similar to its predecessor, two revisions were later released. Virtua Fighter 5 R, released on July 24, 2008, saw the return of Taka-Arashi while introducing a new fighter, Jean Kujo. Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown was released in arcades on July 29, 2010. Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown (known in Japan as Virtua Fighter eSports) was released for Sega ALLs cabinet on June 2, 2021, a day after PlayStation 4 version's release.
The first Virtua Fighter game was ported to the Saturn in 1994 (1995 outside Japan), just months before fellow 3D-fighter Tekken was released. The console port, which was nearly identical to the arcade game, sold at a nearly 1:1 ratio with the Saturn hardware at launch.[10] The port of Virtua Fighter 2 on the Saturn for Christmas 1995 was considered faithful to the arcade original. While the game's 3D backgrounds were now rendered in 2D, resulting in some scenery such as the bridge in Shun Di's river stage being removed, the remainder of the game was kept intact. It became the top-selling Saturn game in Japan. Ports of the original Virtua Fighter and Virtua Fighter 2 with enhanced graphics were also released for the PC. Virtua Fighter 2 was remade as a 2D fighter for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1996, omitting the characters Shun and Lion, and later re-released on the PlayStation 2 as a part of the Sega Ages series. Yakuza 5 was released in 2012 in Japan and in 2015 worldwide and features Virtua Fighter 2 as a mini-game. The only port of Virtua Fighter 3 was for the Sega Dreamcast by Genki (instead of AM2) with Virtua Fighter 3tb in 1998 for the Japanese release of the console.
In a reverse of the usual development cycle for the series, an update of the original Virtua Fighter called Virtua Fighter Remix was released for the Saturn and later ported to the arcade.
Virtua Fighter Mini, based on the anime series, was created for the Game Gear and released in North America and Europe as Virtua Fighter Animation. The game was later ported to the Master System by Tec Toy and released only in Brazil. Brazil itself was a market where the series was very popular.[11]
Following Sega's exit from the hardware market in mid-2001, Virtua Fighter 4 was ported by Sega to the PlayStation 2 in 2002. Outside of a slight downgrade in graphics, the port of the game was considered well done. This port was followed by Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution, an update that added two new characters as well as a host of game balancing tweaks, in 2003. Evolution was immediately released under the PlayStation 2's ""Greatest Hits"" label in the United States, which lowered its initial sticker price.
With the 2003 PlayStation 2 release of Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution arriving in time for the series' tenth anniversary, a remake of Virtua Fighter, Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary, was released exclusively on the PlayStation 2. While the music, stages and low-polygon visual style were retained from the first game, the character roster, animations, mechanics and movesets were taken from Evolution. In the previous PS2 release of Virtua Fighter 4, a button code would make the player's character look like a VF1 model. In Japan, the game was included as part of a box set with a book titled Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary: Memory of a Decade and a DVD. The box set was released in November 2003 and was published by Enterbrain.[12] In North America, the game was included within the home version of Evolution, and in Europe it was only available as a promotional item; it was not sold at retail.
A port of Virtua Fighter 5 was released for the PlayStation 3 in Japan and North America in February 2007, and March 2007 in Europe. The PlayStation 3 port is considered extremely faithful to the arcade original, due in part to the arcade hardware (based on Sega Lindbergh platform) and PlayStation 3 hardware sharing NVidia-provided GPUs of comparable capability. A port for the Xbox 360 was released in October 2007 in Japan and North America, and December 2007 in Europe, and contains the additions of online fighting via Xbox Live, improved graphics, and gameplay balances from the newer revision of the arcade game. For years, the designers have held strong on their refusal to add an online mode to console versions of the games; because the gameplay relies so much on timing, any lag would ruin the experience.[13] Eventually, with the Xbox 360 release of VF5, Sega decided to add online capabilities via Xbox Live. Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown was released as a downloadable title for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in June 2012, with online play available in both versions. An updated version of Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown named Version B was released in Japanese arcades in 2015. Yakuza 6: The Song of Life was released for PlayStation 4 in 2016 in Japan and 2018 worldwide and the game features Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown Version B as a mini-game, making the release of Yakuza 6 also the PlayStation 4 debut for the Virtua Fighter series. Virtua Fighter Ultimate Showdown (known as Virtua Fighter eSports in Japan), a remake which also serves as a final update version of the fifth game's sub-series was co-developed with Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, and released in both PlayStation 4 and Arcade versions in the first two days of June 2021, respectively, with its night generation console title Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. based on recent update of the previous, in additions to rollback netcode and crossplay released in January 2025 for Windows before being set to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch 2.
At The Game Awards 2024, SEGA and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced a new Virtua Fighter. A digital event called Virtua Fighter Direct happening later that same night revealed more about the game in development, including a full look at the models of Akira and a character named Stella, followed by Wolf and an unidentified male character in EVO Japan 2025.[citation needed] According to Famitsu interview with Ryu ga Gotoku Studio representative Yokoyama and producer Yamada, the new Virtua Fighter is in talk to have a story mode, which would mark the first time in the series. Additionally, the new Virtua Fighter is confirmed to be designed for home releases, with Windows version is mentioned to be one of the planned ports. According to the interview, it is revealed that a Ryu ga Gotoku studio member, Seiji Aoki had been appointed to solely produce re-released versions of previous Virtua Fighter games, as he is not involved in the developing sixth Virtua Fighter game.[14]
Due to the success of Virtua Fighter 2, a super deformed version called Virtua Fighter Kids was released for the Sega Saturn and arcades in 1996. 1996 also saw the release of Fighters Megamix for the Sega Saturn, a crossover that pitted the cast of Virtua Fighter 2 against the cast of Fighting Vipers as well as other characters in AM2-developed games. Megamix served as a home preview to Virtua Fighter 3 in a few ways, as the game featured the dodge ability found in VF3 and the Virtua Fighter characters had their moves updated to those found in VF3. Some stages and music from VF3 are also in the game. The Virtua Fighter Kids versions of Akira and Sarah appear as hidden playable characters in the game; the character Siba, who was omitted from the first Virtua Fighter also appears as a hidden playable character. The wrestling video game All-Japan Pro Wrestling Featuring Virtua was released for the Saturn in 1997 and ported to arcades later that year.[15] Released only in Japan, it features Jeffrey and Wolf in addition to an assortment of Japanese wrestlers as playable characters.[16]
In 1996, AM2 began developing a Saturn RPG based on the series, titled Virtua Fighter RPG: Akira's Story, with Akira as the hero.[17] Development moved to the Dreamcast, the Virtua Fighter connection was dropped[18] and the game became Shenmue, released in 1999.[17] Virtua Quest, a simplified role-playing video game (which was also known as Virtua Fighter RPG) with new characters aimed at the children's market, was released for the GameCube in 2004 and the PlayStation 2 in 2005. The Virtua Fighters had their incarnations from Virtua Fighter 4.
During the late 2000s, both Sega and Namco showed interest in a possible cross over between Virtua Fighter and Tekken.[19] This crossover would combine all the characters and fighting styles from both games, but any other inclusions are unknown at the moment. Prior to that, both franchises were represented as Mii Brawler costumes in the Nintendo crossover Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and Wii U, in which Ryu from the Street Fighter series first playable too, whereas Akira himself (based on 10th Anniversary version) physically appeared in the sequel Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as an assist trophy character where Kazuya Mishima from Tekken, including Ken Masters as Ryu's echo fighter first playable too.
A 35 episodes-long anime television series Virtua Fighter was produced by Tōkyō Movie Shinsha, originally airing on TV Tokyo between 1995 and 1996. In 1995, Shogakukan began publishing a Virtua Fighter 2 manga, with creative oversight from Sega AM2 to ensure the characters were portrayed consistently with their original vision.[20] The games' manga adaptation was written by Kyōichi Nanatsuki and illustrated by Yoshihide Fujiwara starting in 1997. In Japan, Virtua Fighter CG Portrait Series, wherein each character in the series had their own Saturn CD showcasing various poses of the fighter, was released around the same time as well. People who collected all the discs could send in their proof of purchases to get a special Portrait CD of Dural. In 2014, Sega formed the production company Stories International for film and TV projects based on their games with Virtua Fighter as an animated project.[21][22]
The first Virtua Fighter merchandise was a set of dolls of the first Virtua Fighter cast which Sega produced for their UFO Catchers (a model of claw crane). These proved so popular that supplies ran out almost immediately, so Sega made additional batches and began producing other Virtua Fighter merchandise to put in the UFO Catchers.[20] When these also proved successful, Sega realized that Virtua Fighter merchandise had mainstream potential, and began licensing the property to merchandise producers such as Bandai.[20]
Sega has also released soundtrack CDs for the games, and even an album of original theme music for the characters called Dancing Shadows.[20]
In Sega's music video game Project DIVA 2nd, Vocaloid Megurine Luka can obtain a Sarah Bryant outfit for gameplay. Jacky Bryant and Akira Yuki appear in Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing as partners competing against other Sega characters in races. Akira Yuki, Sarah Bryant and Pai Chan, appear as guest characters in Tecmo Koei's Dead or Alive 5,[26][27] followed by Jacky Bryant in Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate, marking the first time Virtua Fighter collaborated with a non-Sega fighting game series and for the series to be featured in a tag-team fighting game. Akira Yuki, Pai Chan and Dural appear in the crossover RPG Project X Zone, which features characters from Capcom, Namco Bandai Games, and Sega. Akira Yuki, Pai Chan and Dural return in Project X Zone 2 along with Kage-Maru. In Dengeki Bunko Fighting Climax, Akira Yuki and Pai Chan appears as a playable guest boss where Akira is playable and Pai as assist, though they became regulars in the Ignition update. In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Mii Brawler costumes based on Jacky Bryant's modern appearance and Akira Yuki's first appearance were released as downloadable content. Akira would also appear in Ultimate as an assist trophy in his appearance in Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary (a polygonal form from the first game with both voice lines and a move set from Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution).
Virtua Fighter 2, 2.1, 3tb, and Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown have been near fully-recreated within the Yakuza series of games, as both a playable game inside the in-game arcades and a separate 1 versus 1 multiplayer minigame.[28] Within the game files of Yakuza: Like a Dragon and Yakuza 6, a near full version of Virtua Fighter 5 exists.[29]
The original Virtua Fighter sold more than 40,000 arcade units worldwide by 1996,[30] with each unit costing between $15,000 (equivalent to $33,000 in 2024)[31] and £14,000 / $21,000 (equivalent to $46,000 in 2024).[32] Virtua Fighter 2 also sold more than 40,000 arcade units worldwide, adding up to more than 80,000 unit sales of both games by 1996.[33] Virtua Fighter and Virtua Fighter 2 became Sega's best-selling arcade games of all time, surpassing Out Run (1986),[34] which itself had sold 30,000 arcade cabinets by 1994.[35] Virtua Fighter 3 sold a further 30,000 arcade cabinets by 1997,[36] adding up to 110,000 arcade unit sales for the three games combined by 1997.
In 1994, Virtua Fighter was the year's highest-grossing arcade game in Japan,[37] one of the year's top five highest-grossing arcade video games in the United States,[38] and one of the year's most popular coin-ops in the United Kingdom.[31] In 1995, Virtua Fighter 2 was the year's highest-grossing arcade game in Japan,[39][40] and one of the year's top ten best-selling arcade games in the United States.[41][42]
On the Sega Saturn, Virtua Fighter and Virtua Fighter 2 combined had sold more than 3 million copies worldwide by 1996.[33] Virtua Fighter and Virtua Fighter Remix sold a combined 1,067,036 copies in Japan.[43] Virtua Fighter 2 sold 1.7 million copies in Japan,[44] and more than 500,000 bundled copies in the United States,[45] for a combined 2.2 million copies sold in Japan and the United States. On the Sega Dreamcast, Virtua Fighter 3tb sold 330,631 copies in Japan[46] and 96,390 copies in the United States,[47] for a combined 427,021 copies sold in Japan and the United States.
On the PlayStation 2, Virtua Fighter 4 sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide by 2002.[48] On the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown reached over 300,000 global downloads worldwide across both platforms in 2012. On the PlayStation 4, the limited free-to-play offer of Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown reached over 10 million global downloads worldwide in 2021.[49][50]
As of 2023, the series has sold over 5.5 million units worldwide.[51] The series sales and free-to-play downloads of Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown combined totaled over 18 million units.[52][53][50]
Virtua Fighter is often considered to be the grandfather of 3D fighting games, with each iteration being noted for advancing the graphical and technical aspects of games in the genre. Many 3D fighting game series such as Tekken and Dead or Alive were heavily influenced by Virtua Fighter, and the original Dead or Alive ran on the Model 2 hardware. In 1998, the series was recognized by the Smithsonian Institution for contributions in the field of Art and Entertainment, and became a part of the Smithsonian Institution's Permanent Research Collection on Information Technology Innovation.[8][54] Its arcade cabinets are kept at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, where Virtua Fighter is the only video game on permanent display.[55] In 1999, Next Generation listed the Virtua Fighter series as number 8 on their ""Top 50 Games of All Time"", commenting that, ""Virtua Fighter is the most elegant fighting game ever created. With only two attack buttons, the game still offers an astonishingly wide range of martial art styles.""[56]
Virtua Fighter played a crucial role in popularizing 3D polygon graphics.[57][58][59][60] The success of the Virtua Fighter series resulted in Guinness World Records awarding the series seven world records in Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2008, including ""First Polygon Based Fighting Game"", ""First 3D Fighting Game"", and ""First Fighting Game for a 32-bit Console"". 1UP listed Virtua Fighter as one of the 50 most important games of all time, crediting it for creating the 3D fighting game genre, and more generally, demonstrating the potential of 3D polygon human characters (as the first to implement them in a useful way), showing the potential of realistic gameplay (introducing a character physics system and realistic character animations for the time), and introducing fighting game concepts such as the ring-out and the block button.[58] Virtua Fighter 2 on the Sega Model 2 introduced the use of texture-mapped 3D characters,[61] and motion capture animation technology.[62] Virtua Fighter 3 on the Sega Model 3 further advanced real-time graphics technology, with Computer and Video Games in 1996 comparing it to CGI and referring to it as ""the most astounding display of video game graphic muscle ever in the history of this industry.""[63] In 1997, Next Generation stated that Virtua Fighter had supplanted Street Fighter as the premier fighting game series.[64]
Some of the Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) staff involved in the creation of the original PlayStation video game console credit Virtua Fighter as inspiration for the PlayStation's 3D graphics hardware. According to SCE's Shigeo Maruyama, the PlayStation was originally being considered as a 2D-focused hardware, and it was not until the release of Virtua Fighter that they decided to design the PlayStation as a 3D-focused hardware.[65] Toby Gard also cited Virtua Fighter as an influence on the use of polygonal characters in Tomb Raider and the creation of Lara Croft.[66] John Romero also cited Virtua Fighter as a major influence on the creation of 3D first-person shooter Quake.[67][68] Team Ico's Fumito Ueda also cited Virtua Fighter as an influence on his animation work.[69]
A late 1995 article in Next Generation declared that ""The Virtua Fighter series has been, and will continue to be, the yardstick by which all next generation arcade and console fighting games will be measured for a long time coming.""[70] According to Eurogamer: ""One of Yu Suzuki's most enduring creations once christened every round of new arcade hardware, was a pioneer in 3D graphics and helped establish online fighting. All the while, beneath those achievements emerged a game of exceptional depth and nuance.""[71] 1UP opined: ""Due to its innovation, Virtua Fighter not only influenced competitors' games -- it basically created a genre. Technically, every 3D fighter that came after it owes Virtua Fighter for establishing that a 3D fighter could work.  Even today, Tekken still takes inspiration from Sega's series.""[72] Game Informer's Andy McNamara wrote: ""It has always been my opinion that the Virtua Fighter series is the most intense and balanced of all the 3D fighters on the market. Its control scheme is intuitive, its pacing perfect, and its depth unmatched.""[73] in 2006, IGN ranked Virtua Fighter as the 25th greatest game series of all time, explaining that ""no other 3D fighter has equaled VF in terms of difficulty and depth.""[74]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westwood_Studios,Westwood Studios,"
Westwood Studios, Inc. was an American video game developer based in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was founded by Brett Sperry and Louis Castle in 1985 as Brelous Software, but got changed after 2 months into Westwood Associates and was renamed to Westwood Studios when Virgin Games (later Virgin Interactive Entertainment) bought the company in 1992. The company was bought by Electronic Arts alongside Virgin Interactive's North American operations in 1998.[1] In January 2003, it was announced that Westwood, alongside Westwood Pacific (EA Pacific), would be merged into EA Los Angeles. The main studio location closed in March of that year.
Westwood is best known for developing video games in the real-time strategy, adventure and role-playing genres. It was listed in Guinness World Records for selling 30 million copies of Command & Conquer games worldwide.[2]
Brett Sperry and Louis Castle met in late 1983 in Las Vegas. Sperry had a background in architecture and psychology and was already working in the gaming industry. Both Sperry and Castle worked as contract programmers. The two eventually became friends and decided to form a company together and named it Brelous Software.[3] It was later renamed Westwood Associates.[4][5]
According to Louis Castle, the company was named after the ""entertainment meets professional"" character of the Westwood neighborhood in Los Angeles.
We really liked the ""entertainment meets professional"" character of Westwood CA (in L.A.) and the attraction of the area to teens and young adults felt like the perfect fit for a new company specializing in entertainment software. Even back then we recognized that it took a team of people to make great products so we appended the ""Associates"" to emphasize that aspect of product development. We were not really sure if we could make a go at game development so the original name ""Westwood Associates"" also gave us the ability to get into more traditional business software if necessary.[4]The company's first projects consisted of contract work for companies like Epyx[3] and Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI), porting 8-bit titles to 16-bit systems like Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. Proceeds from contract work allowed the company to expand into designing its own games in-house. Their first original title was Mars Saga, a game developed for Electronic Arts and released in 1988.[6] They laid the foundations for the real-time strategy genre with the release of real-time tactics game BattleTech: The Crescent Hawk's Revenge, one of the more literal translations of the tabletop game BattleTech.[7]
One of the company's first great successes was Eye of the Beholder (1991), a real-time role-playing video game based on the Dungeons & Dragons license, developed for SSI. Other publishers of early Westwood games included Infocom and Disney. Their company was eventually acquired by Virgin Games in 1992.[8]
The company in the late 1980s was known for shipping products late, but by 1993 it had so improved that, Computer Gaming World reported, ""many publishers would assure [us] that a project was going to be completed on time because Westwood was doing it"". The magazine added that it ""not only has a solid reputation for getting product out on time, but a reputation for good product"", citing Eye of the Beholder, The Legend of Kyrandia, and Dune II as examples. By then Westwood had about 50 employees, including up to 20 artists.[5] Other Westwood titles from the early 1990s include Lands of Lore, The Lion King and Young Merlin.[9][10][11] Westwood's greatest commercial success would start in 1995 with the real-time strategy game Command & Conquer. Building on the gameplay and interface ideas of Dune II, it added pre-rendered 3D graphics for gameplay sprites and video cinematics, an alternative pop/rock soundtrack with techno elements streamed from disk, and online play. Command & Conquer, Kyrandia, and Lands of Lore spawned several sequels.
In August 1998, Westwood and sister company Burst Studios was acquired by Electronic Arts for $122.5 million from Virgin Interactive's North American operations, which EA also acquired. At the time, Westwood games had a 5% to 6% share of the PC game market, especially the Command & Conquer franchise was considered very valuable.[1] The 50,000 square foot building in Las Vegas included motion capture facilities, comfortable offices and was considered a showcase for the industry.[12] According to Westwood Studios designer and programmer Joe Bostic, Electronic Arts did not interfere with Westwood's operations primarily due to Westwood co-founder Brett Sperry's efforts in keeping the corporate cultures of the two companies separate, but eventually Westwood succumbed to wishes that every game had to be a hit.[13]
The last games Command & Conquer: Renegade and Earth & Beyond did not meet expectations of the publisher.[4][14] In January 2003, EA announced their intent to close Westwood, as well as EA Pacific, and merge them into EA Los Angeles as part of a consolidation plan.[15] This move included ""significant layoffs"" for Westwood, which at the time employed 100 people, while the remaining people were given the option to transfer to the Los Angeles studio or EA's headquarters.[15] Most employees were let go by January 31, while some staff stayed with Westwood transitionally until it was fully closed on March 31, 2003.[15] Some formed Petroglyph Games in April 2003, while another three (Brett Sperry, Adam Isgreen and Rade Stojsavljevic) formed a development studio called Jet Set Games in 2008, both based in Las Vegas, Nevada.[16]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsfar,Hillsfar,"Hillsfar is a role-playing video game for MS-DOS compatible operating systems, Amiga, Atari ST, and Commodore 64. It was developed by Westwood Associates and published by Strategic Simulations in 1989. It combines real-time action with randomly generated quests and includes elements of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. A port to the Nintendo Entertainment System was released in 1993. Hillsfar received mixed reviews from critics.
Players start their game by creating a character. The game provides three choices: players may select a pre-made character, create their own,[1] or import characters from  previous Strategic Simulations Dungeons & Dragons computer games, such as Pool of Radiance and Curse of the Azure Bonds.[2] When creating a character, players may determine the character's race (dwarf, elf, human or gnome), character class (cleric, fighter, magic-user or thief), and alignment. Various characteristics of the new character, such as strength and intelligence, are assigned a random value by the computer.[3]
There are two aspects to the game: action, where the player performs tasks (expressed as mini-games) such as searching for treasure and traveling between locations, and adventure, where the player completes quests.[4] The choice of character class affects the available quests, with three for each class. While the quests need to be completed in a set order, ""what you do in your time off is up to you"", and thus the player is free to explore other aspects of the game.[1]
The game is presented in three modes. When traveling, the scene is presented using a side-on view; once in the town of Hillsfar, the game converts to a ""bird's-eye view"" of the map; a first-person perspective is employed within the caves. Interaction is handled through what Leslie Eiser of Compute! magazine described as a ""bump interface"", which allows the player to trigger interaction with objects by bumping into them.[5]
The game takes place in the fictional town of Hillsfar. There are guilds for each class; Fighter, Cleric, Mage, and Thief. Depending on the class chosen by the player during their character's creation, the player must go to the appropriate guildmaster, who assigns them several missions. Upon completing all missions issued by the guildmaster, they will increase the player's gold and experience points, and the character then retires.
Hillsfar was successful for SSI, selling 78,418 copies.[7] Reviews tended to be mixed. On the positive side, the combination of arcade action and adventure was generally well received. Andy Smith of Amiga Format, in giving the game a rating of 72%, stated that SSI succeeded in producing ""a good game that is a distinct mix of two very different styles"",[4] while Bob Guerra of Compute! magazine praised the arcade-style sequences, writing that Hillsfar ""does a much better job of integrating these high-quality sequences into the story than many others do"".[3] Roe Adams of Computer Gaming World gave much praise for the thief's lockpicking sequence, but noted the game otherwise failed to live up to expectations; in particular, Adams criticized both the repetitive horseback travel sequence, and the fact that magic-users and clerics cast no magic during the game.[8]
Other reviewers were less impressed with the overall effect. Lucinda Orr of Amiga Computing criticized the overall gameplay, while she was impressed with some of the mini–games, describing them as ""quite entertaining and graphically effective"", she found the game generally boring, writing, ""there is not too much to keep the interest above critical boredom level"".[1]
The game was reviewed in 1989 in Dragon No. 147 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in their ""The Role of Computers"" column. The reviewers gave the game three out of five stars.  The reviewers compared Hillsfar to Pool of Radiance. They felt that the adventure of Hillsfar lacked depth and was less absorbing than Pool of Radiance, but they considered it ""a nice adventure to while away the hours while waiting for SSI to release [the sequel to Pool of Radiance nicknamed] Azure Bonds"". The reviewers also concluded that ""If you enjoyed Pool of Radiance, you'll like Hillsfar"".[6]
Jim Trunzo reviewed Hillsfar in White Wolf #18 (Nov./Dec., 1989), rating it a 3 out of 5 and stated that ""If you're looking for something different; if you're tired of controlling six adventurers at a time; and if you're not put off by the arcade flavor of the game, Hillsfar should be an enjoyable experience for you.""[9]
The NES version was more negatively received. Brent Walker's review in VideoGames & Computer Entertainment assessed, ""The majority of your time is spent gathering gold, which has limited use, and either picking locks or bashing them open. There is also little adventure or strategy required, and I felt more like I was just wading through the game, rather than being pulled into it. Graphically unexciting and mentally uninteresting, I can't find anything in particular to recommend it."" The magazine's team of four editors gave it an average score of 4 out of 10.[10]
According to GameSpy, Hillsfar was considered ""a failed experiment"" by a lot of players.[11]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgotten_Realms:_Unlimited_Adventures,Forgotten Realms: Unlimited Adventures,"Forgotten Realms: Unlimited Adventures, also known as Unlimited Adventures, or by the acronyms FRUA or UA, is a is a construction kit for role-playing video games released for MS-DOS and Mac on March 17, 1993, by Strategic Simulations.[2]
Unlimited Adventures is a construction kit for role-playing video games, and drew its content from the prior Gold Box engine games,[3] with improved graphics. SSI's contract with TSR, Inc. required the former to stop using the Gold Box engine, so the company released its development tools.[4][3] Games created by users can be shared with other players who also own Unlimited Adventures. As of 2022, the program still has an active community of users.[5][non-primary source needed]
The original game allowed the user to create dungeon modules, some editing and renaming of monsters and characters, and to import pictures and monster sprites. However, some art, such as walls, combat backdrops, and title screens, could not be changed in the unmodified game.
Those limitations have been overcome by community-made mods.  The availability of these mods has led to the creation of comprehensive ""worldhacks"", designed to allow the creation of science fiction, superhero, Western and Roman Empire adventures, among others.  A program called ""UASHELL"" applies and manages these hacks and enables the player to apply them.
SSI sold 32,364 copies of Unlimited Adventures.[4] Computer Gaming World in 1993 called it ""the best adventure-construction kit available"" despite the ""sorely lacking"" Gold Box engine.[6] According to GameSpy in 2004, although ""the game's graphics were poor [...] and using the tools could be a little complicated, Unlimited Adventures was an excellent tool for budding RPG designers"".[7]
James Trunzo reviewed Unlimited Adventures: Fantasy Construction Kit in White Wolf #37 (July/Aug., 1993) and stated that ""UA comes with well-written and very complete documentation which includes a number of essential tutorials to give you a feel for design. UA also comes with a complete adventure that you can play and modify. All the scenarios can be saved and played on other computers by your friends. After all, you'll know all the secrets! The fun of UA is in design - both the design of the game and the fun of designing your own adventures.""[8]
Forgotten Realms Unlimited Adventures is included in the compilation ""The Forgotten Realms Archives - Collection Two"".[9]
The fan-made game design program Dungeon Craft (originally called UA Forever) is a standalone program that partially emulates FRUA's engine, but with a greater ease of user modification.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Enhanced_Edition,Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition,"
Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is a 2012 role-playing video game developed by Overhaul Games, a division of Beamdog, and published by Atari. It was released for Microsoft Windows on November 28, 2012, with additional releases between 2012 and 2014 for iPad, OS X, Android and Linux and most recently for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch on October 15, 2019. It is a remaster of the 1998 game Baldur's Gate and its expansion, Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast, retaining the original elements from both (story, in-game locations, gameplay and characters), while including additions, a separate arena adventure entitled The Black Pits, and a number of improvements some of which were imported from Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.
An expansion was released for the remaster in March 2016, Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear, which focuses on the events following the conclusion of Baldur's Gate, that lead up to Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.
Much like the original game, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition follows the rules of the 2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, licensed by Wizards of the Coast[4][5] and features both single-player and multiplayer modes, while much of the gameplay, such as moving between locations, the ""paper doll"" equipment system, and inventory management, remains the same as the original game.
Enhanced Edition has several new features compared to the original game.[6][7] Features created for the remaster include cross-platform functionality for the multiplayer mode, allowing players on different platforms to be able to play with each other,[8][9][10] the addition of a stand-alone arena adventure, The Black Pits, in which players form a party of six adventurers and battle against increasingly difficult opponents, the addition of four characters, each having their own dialogue and some having their own associated adventures, with bonus quest enemies that have been added to the game described as posing a ""more vigorous challenge"", five class kits - the Dwarven Defender, Shadowdancer, Dragon Disciple, Dark Moon Monk and Sun Soul Monk,[11] a few locations added to the game, an achievement system (for Steam versions only), and two difficulty modes - Story Mode, and Legacy of Bhaal. Story Mode is an enhanced version of Easy difficulty, in which all characters in the party cannot die, have a strength stat of 25 (regardless of the actual value) and are immune to most negative effects, while all enemies can be damaged and killed easily. Legacy of Bhaal, in contrast, is an enhanced version of Insane difficulty, with enemies having more hit points, saving throws, THACO and attacks per round, while the difficulty cannot be changed once implemented by the player.
Some of the major improvements to the original game that are incorporated into the remaster, include a revamped user interface, the ability to play at higher resolutions as well as different viewing modes including widescreen, increased flexibility to mod the game, a new renderer, multiplayer matchmaking abilities (at the time of launch, this function was in a beta state),[12][13] updates to the map and journal system, the level cap for the remaster being raised, and the importation of improvements and some elements from both Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and its expansion pack,[6] including classes, subraces and class kits, that were not available in the original game;[14] a later patch the romance element from Baldur's Gate II is also incorporated, but only the new characters have this implemented.[15][16] The developers included an auto-update function, with further modifications made to the remaster based on suggestions made by users.[17]
The iPad and Android versions are described as a radical departure from the game's original interface, allowing for zooming in and out via multi-touch gestures, which allows for larger text. The tablet versions allow for users to swipe between screens instead of clicking on tabs.[13] Ex-Bioware employee and creative director for the enhanced edition Trent Oster said: ""When I describe playing a Baldur's Gate combat scenario to someone, I use the analogy of a football playbook. ... When you think about Baldur's Gate in this light, the iPad makes so much sense. In fact, I think Baldur's Gate is almost the perfect game for the touch interface—it was just released a decade early"".[18]
Much of the game retains the original setting of Baldur's Gate and its expansion - that of the Forgotten Realms continent of Faerûn, the city of Baldur's Gate and the locations south of it within the regions of the Sword Coast and the Western Heartlands, including Beregost, Nashkel, Durlag's Tower and Candlekeep. The main story, too, is still retained - the player creates a character and takes them across the game's setting to investigate the iron crisis that is plunging Baldur's Gate towards a war with the neighbouring nation of Amn, uncovering it as the work of the game's main villain, Sarevok. All of the original characters that can join the player's party, and the quests that can be undertaken from both the main game and the expansion, still present within the remaster. The Enhanced Edition adds four non-player characters (NPCs) that can join the party, with three incorporating standalone story-lines (an element used with NPCs in Baldur's Gate II) of which two feature new locations.
The standalone arena adventure created for the remaster, The Black Pits, features a story set before the main events of Baldur's Gate, in which players create their own party of adventurers, in a similar fashion to that of the Icewind Dale series, and undertake battles in an area situated in a small portion of the Underdark, though there is little to do in terms of exploration except for the holding cells the party can move around within.
Prior to the events of Baldur's Gate, a colony of Duergar dwarves is defeated by a mad drow sorcerer named Baeloth, who imprisons them and forces them to create an entertainment complex of his own design within the Underdark. Through his complex, the Black Pits, Baeloth assumes the title of ""Baeloth the Entertainer"", and draws in living creatures, monsters and adventurers from throughout the realms, either by invitation or forcefully capturing them, and pitting them against each other for loot. All who are brought to the Pits are imprisoned under the effects of a geas and cannot escape, eventually being killed during one of Baeloth's matches, with the exception of a champion, who was pitted against Baeloth himself after winning all their matches, but dying against the sorcerer. Baeloth's latest victims, a party of six adventurers (whose origins and past remain a mystery), survive their qualifying match and find themselves coerced into fighting in the Black Pits, learning that the drow is aided by a djinn named Najim, while their holding cells include several prisoners forced to operate as merchants, and a beholder who offers advice on the matches the party encounter.
Over time, with each successful match, Baeloth becomes increasingly frustrated at their survival against the tougher monsters he brings in, while some of merchants express support for their victories, along with hope that they may become free. Eventually, after becoming champions of the Pits, Baeloth decides to take the group on himself, expecting to defeat them and eliminate them so as to provide the crowds with some new fighters to root for. However, the match ends with Baeloth defeated himself and his geas on all of the complex's prisoners lifted. Najim, grateful of his freedom, helps the party escape, knowing that the duergar clan they freed will see them as outsiders and not accept them. The party swiftly leave by a portal, and enjoy their freedom soon afterwards.[15]
Work on creating the Enhanced Editions of the first two Baldur's Gate games began with negotiations between Beamdog and the game's owners, Atari and Wizards of the Coast, which lasted for approximately fourteen months before a contract was arranged and agreed upon. Along with this, the developer also sought out a license from BioWare for use of the Infinity Engine for the original game's remaster. During development, Beamdog made the decision to openly expand the number of platforms that the two Enhanced Editions would be on. Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition was to have a November 2012 release date and released for both PC and iPad, with the iPad version designed to make it compatible with all three generations (at the time) of the handheld device.[19][20][21] OS X version was also confirmed for release,[22] with the main art content creation program used to make content for the re-forged Infinity Engine being revealed as 3DS Max. Plans for console version of the game were shelved, after developer Trent Oster revealed that an Xbox 360 version of the game could not be made as the controller was not a good fit for it, and a Wii U version was not made after the developers' negative experience with Nintendo while developing MDK2 HD.[23] Another console version, planned for the PlayStation 3, was also cancelled after negotiations between Sony and Beamdog, the former having contacted the developer first about this, broke down over the funding needed for the redesign of the game for the console; Oster revealed that the redesign cost would have been high, due to the amount of work required to fix the controls and make the UI of the game work for the PlayStation 3.[24][25] Oster later revealed that due to fan demand, time for more thought to be put into a console edition had been allocated to after the release of Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition.[26][27] The team also initially looked into a retail edition due to fan demand, later clarifying that it would likely be a collector's edition,[28] but discussion on the matter later led to the possibility being unlikely.[29]
For assistance on the game, Nat Jones was recruited as the art director for the project,[30] with senior Dungeons & Dragons writer Dave Gross brought in on the team as a writer,[31] and Sam Hulick composing additional music for the game.[32] Overhaul also reached out to the modding community of the original Baldur's Gate games for further assistance in their efforts to revive the classic RPG.[33] Speculations raised in August 2012 that the resurrection of Black Isle Studios, the producers of the original Baldur's Gate games, would see Overhaul co-develop the game with them, but they were dismissed by Beamdog who responded that there were no plans to do so, although they wished the new studio luck.[34][35] The game's first playable demo was revealed at PAX Prime 2012.[36] While plans were made to release the game on September 18, delays caused the launch date to be pushed back, due to the amount of work being done to create it in 16 different languages, including English, French, German and Spanish,[37] further improvements to its gameplay, and fixing glitches pointed out to them before launch.[38] In order to make up for the delay, Overhaul revealed information that the game would include further additions to it that the original did not have, including new characters, areas, story and hours of gameplay.[39]
Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition was officially released on November 30, 2012, but due to contract obligations, the game's Windows version was launched on the Beamdog website and also via download from its Client program (although Beamdog Client is not required to play the game after initial activation),[40][41] while the iPad version was launched on Apple's App Store, and the OS X version on the Mac App Store.[42] The game was released on Steam on January 16, 2013.[43] The Linux version of the game was released on November 27, 2014, after being delayed earlier that year on July 1, with Trent Oster explaining on Twitter that the decision to do so was to wait until after the release of a patch to update the game to version 1.3., as part of an improved commitment to quality releases.[44]
Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition was removed from sale on Beamdog's website and the Apple App Store in June 2013, due to contractual issues.[45] The issues were resolved within less than a month, and the game became available for sale at both outlets once again on August 15.[46] Further extensive work was made on the game, with patches released by the developer to fix glitches and problems encountered by players for all available versions of the game. News of updates were often released on their official forums; in August 2014, Beamdog announced the roll-out of a patch (version 1.3.2053) on their forums, stating that it was to be made immediately available to all versions of the game, adding that it had ""..submitted to Apple for approval"" prior to rolling it out on the Mac and iTunes App Stores.[47]
Console versions for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One were released on October 15, 2019 by Skybound Games.[48]
Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition received mostly favorable reviews from critics; on aggregate review website Metacritic the game attains an overall score of 78 out of 100 on the PC.[49] Shacknews praised the remaster, calling the game ""a truly enhanced version of a classic game"".[60] IGN gave the game 8.1, saying that despite having several changes, Baldur's Gate has aged well, and that new players will have hours of fun, but also noted that players will have to approach it with an understanding of its increasingly ""antiquated"" framework.[54] Role-playing game website GameBanshee gave the game a poor review, listing many bugs and oversights and commenting that they prefer the original version over Enhanced Edition due to former having hundreds of mods and bug fix packs, and costing less than the latter version.[61] GameSpy concurred with this, questioning whether $20 was a fair price, but they commended cross-platform support.[62]
As of 2015, the Enhanced Edition sold over a million copies.[63]
After the financial success of enhanced editions of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II, Overhaul Games expressed interest to develop Baldur's Gate 3, describing it as their ""long-term goal"".[64] The success of the enhanced editions led to their decision to remaster Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment, using rules from Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition,[65][66] and the Infinity Enhanced Engine.[67]
Following its launch, the game was succeeded by Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition on November 15, 2013, a remaster that combined Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with its expansion Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, while including the new classes and content from Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, four new characters with new locations and quests tied to them, and a new standalone arena adventure, with the game made available for all of the same platforms.[68] Following its success, Overhaul Games also worked upon and released a remaster of Icewind Dale, entitled Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition, which was released on October 30, 2014.[69]
An expansion entitled Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear was released on March 31, 2016, featuring 25 – 30 hours of new content, and focusing on events that begin after the conclusion of Baldur's Gate, but before the start of Baldur's Gate II.[70]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_(series),Baldur's Gate,"
Baldur's Gate is a series of role-playing video games set in the Forgotten Realms Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting. The series has been divided into two sub-series, known as the Bhaalspawn Saga and the Dark Alliance, both taking place mostly within the Western Heartlands, but the Bhaalspawn Saga extends to Amn and Tethyr. The Dark Alliance series was released for consoles and was critically and commercially successful. The Bhaalspawn Saga was critically acclaimed for using pausable realtime gameplay, which is credited with revitalizing the computer role-playing game (CRPG) genre.
The Bhaalspawn Saga was originally developed by BioWare for personal computers. Beamdog and its division Overhaul Games developed remakes of the original games in HD.[1] The Dark Alliance series was originally set to be developed by Snowblind Studios, but ports were handled by Black Isle Studios, High Voltage Software, and Magic Pockets, with the second game developed by Black Isle.
Black Isle Studios had planned a third series to be set in the Dalelands and be a PC-exclusive hack and slash game with pausable real-time gameplay. The game would not have been connected to the Bhaalspawn Saga series. The game was cancelled when Interplay forfeited the D&D PC license to Atari.[2]
The series was revived in 2012 with Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, an update of the original Baldur's Gate using an enhanced Infinity Engine. The release of the Enhanced Edition marked the first release in the series in eight years, and was followed by an enhanced edition of the second Baldur's Gate called Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition.[3] Beamdog was granted permission to develop new games with the license, such as Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear, an expansion for Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.[4] The license was later given to Larian Studios, who developed and published Baldur's Gate 3, released in 2023.
The Baldur's Gate series brought technical advancements over role-playing video games of the past. BioWare's Infinity Engine offers a pre-rendered isometric worldview, with sprite-based characters. Baldur's Gate was the third computer game to make use of the Lua scripting language. The engine was used for Planescape: Torment and the Icewind Dale series.
The earliest released in the series are based on a real-time modification of the second edition AD&D (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons) ruleset. The player's party can have up to six members, either created by the player according to the AD&D rules or non-player characters (NPCs) recruited by the protagonist from the game world. 
Baldur's Gate 3 is based on Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, and the party is limited to 4 characters.
Numerous side quests and plot twists are associated with particular NPCs and can be activated if they are found in the player's party. Through extensive, context-dependent dialogue, many characters inside and outside the player's party are fleshed out and given an added level of complexity.
The first game in the series was Baldur's Gate and introduces the player character as an orphan who has been raised by the sage Gorion in the fortified library-monastery of Candlekeep, south of Baldur's Gate and north of the kingdom of Amn. After an urgent departure from Candlekeep and a violent separation from their foster father, the protagonist searches for Gorion's allies and becomes involved with solving the region's iron crisis which has been mysteriously causing all metal to crumble, while avoiding or battling increasingly powerful enemies who have been tasked with taking their life. An expansion pack for Baldur's Gate called Tales of the Sword Coast did not add to the primary storyline, but presented the protagonist with more areas to explore along the Sword Coast, more powerful enemies, more spells, and better equipment. It also allows the player character to reach higher levels of experience, made some general changes to gameplay, and altered the original game's final battle.
The sequel to Baldur's Gate was Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. The main character is captured by Jon Irenicus and must escape into the city of Athkatla, the capital of Amn. Here the protagonist faces several different ways to figure out the reason behind the capture, as they journey through the region of Amn and the Underdark. The game presents a number of innovations over the first Baldur's Gate game, including further specialization of character classes, better graphics, and higher power levels. It also allowed more interaction with the game's joinable NPCs, including friendships, romances, and your own party members' interactions with one another. Throne of Bhaal is an expansion pack for Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, and includes both an expansion of the original game, such as new areas to explore, and a conclusion to the Bhaalspawn story arc started in the first Baldur's Gate game.
The third main title, Baldur's Gate 3, was developed by Larian Studios in partnership with Wizards of the Coast, which holds the license for the Dungeons & Dragons IP. It was released in 2023 for Windows PC, Mac OS, PS5, Xbox Series X/S.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]
The action role-playing game Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance was developed by Snowblind Studios and others, and released in 2001 for the PlayStation 2 console, and later Xbox and GameCube video game consoles. The game takes place in the city of Baldur's Gate and surrounding area and is set in the Forgotten Realms setting, with a ruleset derived from the 3rd edition of Dungeon & Dragons; the plot is unrelated to previous PC games. The console version used an overhead third person view, and hack-and-slash dungeon crawl style gameplay. A Game Boy Advance version was released in 2004, with reduced graphics quality using an 2.5D isometric type perspective. While all ports were very well received, the original for the PlayStation 2 was the only one that gained universal acclaim.
A sequel, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II was developed by Black Isle Studios and released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox; the game used the same gameplay style as the original, and was also positively reviewed. The gameplay style was expanded to make the game more like a role-playing game, the ability to craft weapons, armor and amulets was added, Baldur's Gate became a hub city with the addition of a world map and being able to travel back to areas, making the game open world and many more side-quests were added as well as the ability to level up one's class.
Interplay Entertainment placed its entire catalogue of video game intellectual properties (IP) and assets up for sale, including that of Dark Alliance in 2016.[14][15]
The original game was remade in 2012 by Overhaul Games and Beamdog, 14 years after the release of the original game. It was re-released on multiple platforms as Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, a collection of the original game and its expansion Tales of the Sword Coast.[16] A brand new expansion named Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear[4] was released in 2016.
Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, a remake of the second game, was released in 2013. It was developed by Overhaul Games for PC, Mac OS X, iOS, Linux and Android, featuring a modified version of the Infinity Engine.[17] The game features new content and widescreen compatibility, and utilized 2nd Edition D&D rules.[18] Beamdog also made enhanced versions of other Infinity Engine games, including Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment and Neverwinter Nights.
The enhanced versions were released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2019.
Baldur's Gate III: The Black Hound (code named Jefferson and FR6) was mentioned in early 2001 as a new game in the Baldur's Gate series to be made by Black Isle Studios using a new 3D engine.[19] The game was originally announced in 2002 and was said to have used the 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons ruleset. Many new gameplay features were also going to be added to fit the 3rd Edition Ruleset better, and elements from the Dark Alliance series would have also been borrowed. The game used the Jefferson Engine which featured 3D effects such as casting dynamic shadows.
The Black Hound was originally going to be a departure from the high-powered epic of the Bhaalspawn saga to a low-key, role-playing plot. With protagonists progressing to around level four at the end of Black Isle Studios' typically large campaign and a hard cap at level eight, gameplay was refocussed to adventure, with emphasizing quests over combat. The game was only titled Baldur's Gate due to Interplay having lost the general D&D license to Atari, but still retaining the right to make Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale branded D&D games (the same reason as for Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance's title).[19] The game was not going to be connected to the previous Baldur's Gate series in any way and would start a new series, the Black Hound series. It was to be a sequel in terms of gameplay and not story, although it would have continued some aspects of the Icewind Dale II story.
Development on Baldur's Gate III: The Black Hound was cancelled in 2003 and the third game in the Dark Alliance series was also cancelled in 2004 when Black Isle Studios was closed in the same year by parent company Interplay Entertainment Corp.[20] The engine for The Black Hound was re-purposed for the development of the similarly ill-fated Van Buren project, the working title for the eventual Fallout 3. The game was 75% finished before it was canceled. Its cancellation happened due to Interplay losing the right to publish Baldur's Gate games on the PC yet retaining the Baldur's Gate name for consoles; the result of this was Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II.
In an interview with Winterwind Productions, Black Hound developer Damien Foletto revealed the story and setting of the game, which would have been in the Dalelands. The player character would have been resting at their campsite when a woman chasing a Black Hound crashes in; she kills the hound, which dies on the player character 's lap. Accusing the player character of being in league with the dog, she is about to kill the player character as well, but the Riders of Archendale arrive and scare her off before questioning the player character. After a brief inquisition, the local magistrates tell the player character not to wander far because they may have more questions. The player's quest would involve finding out who the mad cleric was, what this has to do with them, why a black spirit hound follows them around, and why people can not leave the player character alone and do things for themselves instead.[21]
Atari stated in December 2008 in a press conference that the Baldur's Gate series (among others) would be revisited after 2009.[22] As a personal side project, Sawyer continued work on The Black Hound as a module for Neverwinter Nights 2 for a time.[23]
After finishing the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II, Overhaul Games announced to develop Baldur's Gate 3 with funding from Kickstarter.[24] The studio later clarified their Baldur's Gate game to be a separate game from The Black Hound.[25] Game developer Trent Oster suggested Thay[26] and Waterdeep[27] as possible settings for the game. Beamdog began calling the game Baldur's Gate Next as a way to differentiate it from the Bhaalspawn Saga.[28]
Overhaul Games and Beamdog eventually lost the rights to develop further Baldur's Gate games and the license was later acquired by Larian Studios, the Belgian developer behind the Divinity: Original Sin series. Their project, Baldur's Gate 3, was unveiled in 2019 and released four years later.
The Baldur's Gate series features a wide array of characters. Some characters can be recruited by the player as party members and accompany the player character in their adventures. Other major characters influence the plot of the game but are not playable characters, serving as either antagonists or supporting characters in their interactions with the player character. The player character for the main series is fully customizable, whereas the Dark Alliance sub-series feature a choice of defined characters for the player to choose from.
In addition, a number of major Forgotten Realms characters make guest appearances throughout the Baldur's Gate series, such as Drizzt Do'Urden, Elminster, and Volothamp Geddarm.
Philip Athans, editor of the Forgotten Realms novel line, wrote the first two novels in the Baldur's Gate trilogy of novels: Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, both are novelizations of the video game series' storylines. The novels follow the basic outline of the original stories, but eschew several of the games' numerous subplots and include only a few of the NPCs. The Bhaalspawn main character is named Abdel Adrian in the novels. The third novel, Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, was authored by Drew Karpyshyn.
A comic titled Dungeons & Dragons: Legends of Baldur's Gate was released in October 2014. The comic is set generations after Throne of Bhaal, and features Minsc as the main character. It is written by Jim Zub and pencilled by Max Dunbar, part of the Dungeons & Dragons 40th anniversary celebrations.[42]
In 1999, Baldur's Gate won the Origins Award for Best Role Playing Game Computer Game of 1998,[58] and in 2000, Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast won Best Role Game Playing Game Computer Game of 1999.[59] The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences awarded the original Baldur's Gate the Interactive Achievement Award for PC Role-Playing Game of the Year. Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal and Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance also would later win Interactive Achievement Awards for Role-Playing Game of the Year for its respective PC and Console categories for the release year of 2001.[60] Dark Alliance II won the 2004 RPG of the Year Award by GameFan, and was later inducted into the GameFan Hall of Fame.[61] By June 2001, the series sold more than 3.5 million units worldwide.[62]
PC Gamer's Paul Dean noted that the series ""has always been as much about who these characters were as what they could do"". He considered Baldur's Gate's characters as the cornerstone of the series, and that some of them were the best RPG companions ever written.[41]
Baldur's Gate 3 received universal acclaim, and won several Game of the Year awards including from the Golden Joystick Awards, the Game Awards, the D.I.C.E. Awards, the Game Developers Choice Awards, and the British Academy Games Awards.[63][64][65][66]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model,Subscription business model,"The subscription business model is a business model in which a customer must pay a recurring price at regular intervals for access to a product or service. The model was pioneered by publishers of books and periodicals in the 17th century.[1] It is particularly common now for digital products, which lend themselves more naturally toward a subscription model.[2]
Subscriptions can be a more convenient, hassle-free transaction for consumers.[2] However, due to inertia among some consumers, they may inadvertently pay for subscriptions that they no longer value because they do not realize that they are subscribed.[2]
Rather than selling products individually, a subscription offers periodic (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, semi-annual, yearly/annual, or seasonal) use or access to a product or service, or, in the case of performance-oriented organizations such as opera companies, tickets to the entire run of some set number of (e.g., five to fifteen) scheduled performances for a whole season. Thus, a one-time sale of a product can become a recurring sale and build brand loyalty.[3]
Industries that use this model include mail order book sales clubs and music sales clubs, private web mail providers, cable television, satellite television providers with pay television channels, providers with digital catalogs with downloadable music or eBooks, audiobooks, satellite radio, telephone companies, mobile network operators, internet providers, software publishers, websites (e.g., blogging websites), business solutions providers, financial firms, health clubs, lawn mowing and snowplowing services, pharmaceuticals, renting an apartment, property taxes, as well as the traditional newspapers, magazines, and academic journals.
Renewal of a subscription may be periodic and activated automatically so that the cost of a new period is automatically paid for by a pre-authorized charge to a credit card or a checking account. A common variation of the model in online games and on websites is the freemium model, in which the first tier of content is free. Still, access to premium features (for example, game power-ups or article archives) is limited to paying subscribers.[4]
In addition to the freemium model, other subscription pricing variations are gaining traction. For instance, the tiered pricing model is frequently used in software as a service (SaaS) platforms, offering customers different access levels and features based on their subscription tier. This model is particularly effective for tailoring services to customer requirements. Another approach is the usage-based pricing model, which calculates charges based on the extent of service or product utilization by the customer. This model is becoming increasingly prevalent, especially in services where customer usage varies significantly.[5]
There are different categories of subscriptions:
In publishing, the subscription model typically involves a paywall, paysite, or other ""toll-access"" system (named in opposition to open access). As revenues from digital advertising diminish, a paid subscription model is being favoured by more publishers who see it as a comparatively stable income stream.[8]
In the field of academic publishing, the subscription business model means that articles of a specific journal or conference proceedings are only available to subscribers. Subscriptions are typically sold to universities and other higher education institutions and research institutes, though some academic publishers also sell individual subscriptions or access to individual articles.
In contrast with other media such as newspapers, subscription fees to academic publishers generally do not go towards supporting the creation of the content: the scientific articles are written by scientists and reviewed by other scientists as part of their work duties. The publisher does not pay the paper authors and reviewers. In this light, the subscription model has been called undesirable by proponents of the open access movement.
Academic publications that use the subscription model are called ""closed-access"" in opposition to their open-access counterparts.
Businesses benefit because they are assured a predictable and constant revenue stream from subscribed individuals for the duration of the subscriber's agreement. Not only does this greatly reduce uncertainty and the riskiness of the enterprise, but it often provides payment in advance (as with magazines, and concert tickets), while allowing customers to become greatly attached to using the service and, therefore, more likely to extend by signing an agreement for the next period close to when the current agreement expires.[3]
In an integrated software solution, for example, the subscription pricing structure is designed so that the revenue stream from the recurring subscriptions is considerably more significant than the revenue from simple one-time purchases. Some subscription schemes (like magazines) also increase sales by not allowing subscribers to accept or reject any specific issue. This reduces customer acquisition costs and allows personalized marketing or database marketing. However, the system requires that the business have an accurate, reliable, and timely way to manage and track subscriptions.
From a marketing-analyst perspective, the vendor has the added benefit of knowing the number of currently active members since a subscription typically involves a contractual agreement. This so-called 'contractual' setting facilitates customer relationship management to a large extent because the analyst knows who is an active customer and who recently churned.[9]
Additional benefits include a higher average customer lifetime value (ACLV) than that of nonrecurring business models, greater customer inertia and a more committed customer base as it transitions from purchase to opt-out decisions, and more potential for upselling and cross-selling other products or services.[10]
Some software companies such as Adobe and Autodesk have moved from a perpetual licensing model to a subscription model, known as ""software as a service"". This move has significant implications for sales and customer support organizations. Over time, the need to close large deals decreases, resulting in lower sales costs. However, the size of the customer support organization increases so that the paying customers stay happy.[11]
Consumers may find subscriptions convenient if they believe they will buy a product regularly and might save money. The customer saves time for repeated delivery of the product or service.[3]
Subscriptions which exist to support clubs and organizations call their subscribers ""members"" and they are given access to a group with similar interests.[3]
Subscription pricing can make it easier to pay for expensive items since they can often be paid for over time and thus can make the product seem more affordable. On the other hand, most newspaper and magazine-type subscriptions are paid upfront, which may prevent some customers from subscribing. Fixed prices may be an advantage for consumers who frequently use those services. However, it could disadvantage a customer who plans to use the service frequently but later does not. The commitment to paying for a package may have been more expensive than a single purchase. In addition, subscription models increase the possibility of vendor lock-in, which can have fatally business-critical implications for a customer if its business depends on the availability of software: For example, without an online connection to a licensing server to verify the licensing status every once in a while, a software under a subscription-model would typically stop functioning or fall back to the functionality of a freemium version, thereby making it impossible (to continue) to use the software in remote places or particularly secure environments without internet access, after the vendor has stopped supporting the version or software, or even has gone out of business leaving the customer without a chance to renew the subscription and access his data or designs maintained with the software (in some businesses it is important to have full access even to old files for decades). Also, consumers may find repeated payments to be onerous.[3]
Subscription models often require or allow the business to gather substantial amounts of information from the customer (such as magazine mailing lists), and this raises issues of privacy.[3]
A subscription model may benefit the software buyer if it forces the supplier to improve its product. Accordingly, a psychological phenomenon may occur when a customer renews a subscription, that may not occur during a one-time transaction: if the buyer is not satisfied with the service, he/she can leave the subscription to expire and find another seller.[12]
Because customers may only need or want some of the items received, this can lead to waste and an adverse effect on the environment, depending on the products. Greater volumes of production, greater energy and natural resource consumption, and subsequently greater disposal costs are incurred.[citation needed]
Subscription models also create the opposite effect. This can be illustrated by subscribing to a service for mowing lawns. The effective use of a single mower increases when mowing for a collection of homes; instead of every family owning a lawnmower that is not used as much as the service-providing mower, the use of resources for producing lawnmowers, therefore, decreases while lawns stay cut.[citation needed]

Bonham Carter's paternal grandparents were British Liberal politicians Sir Maurice Bonham-Carter and Lady Violet Bonham Carter. Sir Maurice was descended from John Bonham Carter, Member of Parliament for Portsmouth. Violet was a daughter of H. H. Asquith, 1st Earl of Oxford and Asquith and Prime Minister of Britain 1908–1916. Violet's brother was Anthony Asquith, English director of such films as Carrington V.C. and The Importance of Being Earnest.  Helena is also a first cousin of the economist Adam Ridley[6] and of politician Jane Bonham Carter.
Bonham Carter is a distant cousin of actor Crispin Bonham-Carter. Her other prominent distant relatives include Lothian Bonham Carter, who played first-class cricket for Hampshire, his son, Vice Admiral Sir Stuart Bonham Carter, who served in the Royal Navy in both world wars, and pioneering English nurse Florence Nightingale.[7]
Her maternal grandfather, Spanish diplomat Eduardo Propper de Callejón, saved thousands of Jews from the Holocaust during the Second World War, for which he was recognised as Righteous Among the Nations,[8] and posthumously received the Courage to Care Award from the Anti-Defamation League.[9] His own father was a Bohemian Jew, and his wife, Helena's grandmother, was a Jewish convert to Catholicism.[10][8] He later served as Minister-Counselor at the Spanish Embassy in Washington, D.C.[11]
Her maternal grandmother, Baroness Hélène Fould-Springer, was from an upper-class Jewish family; she was the daughter of Baron Eugène Fould-Springer (a French banker descended from the Ephrussi family and the Fould dynasty) and Marie-Cécile von Springer (whose father was Austrian-born industrialist Baron Gustav von Springer, and whose mother was from the de Koenigswarter family).[12][13][14] Hélène Fould-Springer converted to Catholicism after the Second World War.[10][15] Hélène's sister was the French philanthropist Liliane de Rothschild (1916–2003), the wife of Baron Élie de Rothschild, of the prominent Rothschild family (who had also married within the von Springer family in the 19th century);[16] Liliane's other sister, Therese Fould-Springer, was the mother of British writer David Pryce-Jones.[13]
Bonham Carter was born in Islington, London.[17] Her father, Raymond Bonham Carter, who came from a prominent British political family, was a merchant banker and served as the alternative British director representing the Bank of England at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, DC, during the 1960s.[12][18] Her mother, Elena (née Propper de Callejón), is a psychotherapist who is of Spanish and mostly Bohemian and French-Jewish background, and whose parents were diplomat Eduardo Propper de Callejón from Spain and painter Baroness Hélène Fould-Springer.[12][19] Bonham Carter's paternal grandmother was politician and feminist Violet Bonham Carter, daughter of H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during the first half of the First World War.[20]
Bonham Carter has two older brothers; Edward and Thomas. They were brought up in Golders Green, and she was educated at South Hampstead High School, and completed her A-levels at Westminster School.[21] Bonham Carter applied to King's College, Cambridge, but was rejected ""because officials were afraid that she would leave mid-term to pursue an acting career.""[22]
When Bonham Carter was five, her mother had a serious nervous breakdown, from which she needed three years to recover. Soon afterwards, her mother's experience in therapy led her to become a psychotherapist herself. Bonham Carter has since paid her to read her scripts and deliver opinions on the characters' psychological motivations.[23] Five years after her mother's recovery, her father was diagnosed with acoustic neuroma. He suffered complications during an operation to remove the tumour, which led to a stroke, leaving him half-paralysed and using a wheelchair.[24] With her brothers at college, Bonham Carter was left to help her mother cope. She later studied her father's movements and mannerisms for her role in The Theory of Flight.[25] He died in January 2004.[26]
Bonham Carter, who has had no formal acting training,[27] entered the field winning a national writing contest in 1979, and used the money to pay for her entry into the actors' Spotlight directory. She made her professional acting debut at the age of 16 in a television commercial. She also had a minor part in the 1983 TV film A Pattern of Roses.[28] In the early 1990s, Bonham Carter studied clown under master clown Philippe Gaulier at École Philippe Gaulier.[29][30]
Bonham Carter's first lead film role was as Lady Jane Grey in Lady Jane (1986), which was given mixed reviews by critics. Her breakthrough role was as Lucy Honeychurch in A Room with a View (1985), an adaptation of E. M. Forster's 1908 novel, which was filmed after Lady Jane, but released two months earlier.

Bonham Carter was originally cast for the role of Bess McNeill in Breaking the Waves, but backed out during production owing to ""the character's painful psychic and physical exposure"", according to Roger Ebert.[31] The role went to Emily Watson, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance.[32]
Her early films led to her being typecast as a ""corset queen"" and ""English rose"", playing pre- and early 20th century characters, particularly in Merchant Ivory films.[3] Uncomfortable with this image, she states: ""I looked, as someone said, like a bloated chipmunk"".[3] In 1994, Bonham Carter appeared in a dream sequence during the second series of the British sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, as Edina Monsoon's daughter Saffron, who was normally played by Julia Sawalha.

Thompson has said she has ""no hard feelings"" towards Bonham Carter, calling her affair with Branagh ""blood under the bridge"".[79] She explained: ""You can't hold on to anything like that. It's pointless. I haven't got the energy for it. Helena and I made our peace years and years ago. She's a wonderful woman.""[79] Thompson, Branagh, and Bonham Carter all later went on to appear in the Harry Potter series (none of them shared any scenes); Thompson and Bonham Carter both appeared in Order of the Phoenix.
In 2001, Bonham Carter began a relationship with American director Tim Burton, whom she met while filming Planet of the Apes. Burton cast her in a number of his other films, including Big Fish, Corpse Bride, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Alice in Wonderland, and Dark Shadows. After their separation, Bonham Carter said, ""It might be easier to work together without being together anymore. He always only cast me with great embarrassment.""[80]
Bonham Carter and Burton lived in adjoining houses in Belsize Park, London. She owned one of the houses; Burton later bought the other, and they connected the two.

Bonham Carter and Burton have a son and daughter together.[83][84][19] She told The Daily Telegraph of her struggles with infertility and the difficulties she had during her pregnancies. She said that before the conception of her daughter, she and Burton had been trying for a baby for two years and, although they conceived naturally, they were considering in vitro fertilisation.[85]
On 23 December 2014, the two announced that they had ""separated amicably"" earlier that year.[86][87] Of the separation, Bonham Carter told Harper's Bazaar: ""Everyone always says you have to be strong and have a stiff upper lip, but it's okay to be fragile. ...You've got to take very small steps, and sometimes you won't know where to go next because you've lost yourself."" She added: ""With divorce, you go through massive grief—it is a death of a relationship, so it's utterly bewildering. Your identity, everything, changes.""[80]
Since 2018, Bonham Carter has been in a relationship with art historian Rye Dag Holmboe.[88] Holmboe is 21 years her junior. Regarding their age gap, Bonham Carter told The Times in 2019: ""Everybody ages at a different rate. My boyfriend is unbelievably mature. He's an old soul in a young body, what more could I want? People are slightly frightened of older women, but he isn't. Women can be very powerful when they're older.""[89]
Bonham Carter is known for her unconventional and eccentric sense of fashion.[90][91] British Vogue described her dark style in clothing and acting as ""quirky and irreverent"".[92] Vanity Fair named her on its 2010 Best-Dressed List[93] and she was selected by Marc Jacobs to be the face of his Autumn/Winter 2011 advertising campaign.[94] She has cited Vivienne Westwood and Marie Antoinette as her main style influences.[93]
In May 2021, Bonham Carter featured in a commercial for British furniture retailer Sofology, taking viewers through the quirks and stylistic flourishes of her home.[95] In 2021, she wrote an article for Harper's Bazaar on the influence of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland on her life since she first read the book as a child: ""As far back as I can remember, I’ve been a wannabe Alice"", adding, ""everywhere I look at home, every view has some reference to Alice: frog footman candlesticks, teacup constructions, a teapot lamp, a chessboard teapot, an oversized pocket watch, undersized doors, bunnies, internal windows that look like mirrors, and mirrors that look like windows"".[96]
Bonham Carter has been the recipient of a BAFTA Award, a Critics' Choice Movie Award, an International Emmy Award and three Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as receiving further nominations for two Academy Awards, nine Golden Globe Awards and five Primetime Emmy Awards. She has received other prestigious awards such as a Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award and two National Board of Review awards.[50]

Drive is a 2011 American action drama film directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. The screenplay, written by Hossein Amini, is based on James Sallis's 2005 novel. The film stars Ryan Gosling as an unnamed Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver. He quickly grows fond of his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son, Benicio. When her debt-ridden husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac), is released from prison, the two men take part in what turns out to be a failed million-dollar heist that endangers the lives of everyone involved. The film co-stars Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Christina Hendricks, and Ron Perlman.
Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel optioned the source novel after Siegel read a review from Publishers Weekly. Adapting the book proved to be challenging for Amini, as it had a nonlinear narrative. Gosling, one of Platt's top casting choices, eventually signed on for the lead, as he wanted to star in an action-oriented project. Gosling played a pivotal role in the film's production, which included hiring Refn as director and Beth Mickle as production designer. Newton Thomas Sigel oversaw the principal photography, which started on September 25, 2010, was shot on location in Los Angeles, and ended on November 12.
Before its September 2011 release, Drive had been shown at the 64th Cannes Film Festival, earning Refn the Best Director Award. The film was praised for its direction, cinematography, performances (particularly Gosling and Brooks'), visuals, action sequences, and musical score; however, some critics were appalled by its graphic violence and found it to be potentially detrimental to the film's box office success. Nonetheless, the film was still a commercial success, grossing over $81 million against a production budget of $15 million. Several critics listed Drive as one of the best films of 2011, including the National Board of Review. Its accolades include a nomination for Best Sound Editing at the 84th Academy Awards. The film has garnered a cult following since release.[5][6]
A man in Los Angeles (billed as ""The Driver"") works as a mechanic, stunt double, and criminal-for-hire getaway driver. His jobs are all managed by auto shop owner Shannon, who persuades Jewish-American mobster Bernie Rose and his half-Italian partner Nino ""Izzy"" Paolozzi to purchase a stock car for the Driver to race as a legitimate business for them all.
The Driver grows close to his new neighbor, Irene, and her young son, Benicio, but their relationship is interrupted when Irene's husband, Standard Gabriel, is released from prison. While in prison, Standard owed protection money to an Albanian gangster named Cook, who demands Standard rob a pawn shop for $40,000 to pay off the debt, threatening to harm Benicio and Irene. Driver offers to act as the getaway driver for Standard and Blanche, Cook's accomplice.
At the pawn shop, Blanche exits with a bag of money, but Standard is killed by the store owner. Another car waiting in the parking lot immediately pursues them, but Driver shakes it off. Hiding at a motel, a suspicious Driver forces Blanche to admit she and Cook planned to take the money for themselves, and Cook's henchmen were in the waiting car. Informed by her text messages, two gunmen locate the motel room and one shoots Blanche in the head. Driver kills both gunmen.
Shannon offers to hide the money, but Driver declines. Interrogating Cook at a strip club, he learns that Nino was behind the robbery. The Driver calls Nino and offers to return the money in exchange for peace. However, Nino instead sends a hitman to the Driver and Irene's apartment building. The Driver tells an angry Irene about his involvement with her husband's death, and they enter the elevator, not realizing the hitman is in it. Noticing the man's gun, the Driver kisses Irene goodbye. He subdues and brutally stomps the hitman to death in front of a horrified Irene.
The Driver confronts Shannon, who reveals that he called Bernie about the money and unwittingly mentioned Irene. Furious, the Driver tells Shannon to flee, as Nino will surely hunt them both. Nino reveals to Bernie that a low-level Philadelphia mobster stashed the money at the pawn shop to set up a new operation. Anyone tied to the robbery must be killed, as they could lead the East Coast mob to Nino and Bernie.
Bernie murders Cook. When Shannon refuses to divulge the Driver's whereabouts, Bernie fatally slashes Shannon's forearm with a straight razor. The Driver discovers Shannon's corpse at the auto shop. He disguises himself with a rubber stuntman's mask and follows Nino from the pizzeria to the Pacific Coast Highway. He rams Nino's car onto a beach, then drowns him in the ocean. He calls Irene and tells her that he will not return, explaining that she and Benicio were the best part of his life.
The Driver meets with Bernie, who promises that Irene will be safe in exchange for the money. At the Driver's car, Bernie stabs him in the stomach, but he stabs Bernie to death and manages to drive away, leaving Bernie's corpse and the money behind. Irene knocks on the Driver's apartment door and walks away when no one answers. Although wounded, the Driver drives into the night.
I felt that the way the world was presented in the book demanded that its true grit be retained in the script. The grit comes from seeing the world from the point of view of the driver in the car.
The novel Drive by James Sallis was published in 2005.[8] Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly.[9] The Driver intrigued Siegel because he was ""the kind of character you rarely see anymore — he was a man with a purpose; he was very good at one thing and made no apologies for it"". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood.[9]
Hossein Amini adapted the novel for the screen. He felt it was a rare book to receive from a studio because it was short, gloomy, and like a poem. Since the novel does not present a linear story, but has many flashbacks and jumps around in time, Amini found the adaptation challenging. He felt the non-linear structure made it ""a very tricky structure"" for a feature film.[7]
A film adaptation of Drive was first announced in early 2008, with Neil Marshall set to direct what was being described as ""an L.A.-set action mystery"", planned as a starring vehicle for Hugh Jackman. Universal Studios, which had tried to make a film version for some time, was also on board.[10][11] By February 2010, Marshall and Jackman were no longer attached to the project.
Platt contacted actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: ""I have this list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me — writers, directors, actors whom I have to work with before I go onto another career or do something else with my life."" Despite having starred in films of diverse genres, Gosling had never starred in anything like Drive but had been interested in acting in an action-oriented project. Gosling said that he had been put off by the many current action genre films that focused more on stunts instead of characters. He responded to Platt about two days later, as he was strongly attracted to the plot and the leading role. He thought the story had a ""very strong character"" at its core, and a ""powerful"" romance.[12]
In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the earlier script when Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He said:
I think that might be the original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft – maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in trying to figure out who would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film.[13] When Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career.[14] He chose Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. ""It had to be [him]. There was no other choice.""[14][15]
When Refn read the first screenplay for Drive, he was more intrigued by the concept of a man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the plot of the story.[16] Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script, as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about whether Refn wanted to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.[16]
When casting roles in his films, Refn does not watch casting tapes or have his actors audition for him. Instead, he meets with them and casts them on the spot if he feels they are right.[17] Drive was the first film that British actress Carey Mulligan signed to do after being nominated for an Academy Award for her role in An Education (2009), which was directed by Lone Scherfig, also a Danish filmmaker (Scherfig used to babysit Refn when he was a child, and they have become good friends).[18] At the time of Mulligan's casting, Refn had not seen An Education. However, his wife was a fan of the film and Mulligan's performance, and she urged him to cast her.[19] In the original script, the character was a Hispanic woman named Irina. The character was changed to Irene after Mulligan was cast; Refn said that he ""couldn't find any actress that would click with [him] personally"".[20]
While working on the film, Refn had some cast and production members move in temporarily with him, his wife and two daughters in their home in Los Angeles. This included Carey Mulligan[21] and Hossein Amini, the screenwriter. This enabled them to be immersed in the film. Refn and Amini made significant changes to the original script during this time.[22]
Bryan Cranston plays the role of Shannon.[23] Refn knew he wanted to cast Cranston, as he was a fan of his work in the TV series Breaking Bad. Knowing Cranston had other opportunities, Refn asked the actor how he would like to develop the role. After not hearing back, Refn called him; Cranston was just then writing the pros and cons of doing Drive for himself. Moved by Refn's interest, Cranston accepted the part.[17] Christina Hendricks plays the small role of Blanche.[23] ""Trying to work in a more reality arena for a character like that,"" Refn originally auditioned porn stars for Blanche. He was unable to find anyone with the necessary acting talent. After meeting with Hendricks, he decided to cast her, as he felt her persona would click with the character.[17]
Albert Brooks plays the foul-mouthed, morose Bernie Rose. When Refn suggested him, Gosling agreed but thought the actor might not want to play a character who is violent and sullen or appear in a film that he did not work on himself.[23] Brooks accepted the role to go against type, and because he loved that Bernie was not a cliché.
There are six people you could always get to play this kind of part, and I like that the director was thinking outside of the box. For me, it was an opportunity to act outside the box. I liked that this mobster had real style. Also, he doesn't get up in the morning thinking about killing people. He's sad about it. Upset about it. It's a case of, 'Look what you made me do.'[24]Nino, a key villain, is portrayed by Ron Perlman, one of the last actors to join the cast. Refn said, ""The character of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he's done so many great films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', and I asked why, and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me.""[23] Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. Finding the role somewhat unappealing, he developed the archetypal character into something more.
He said of the role:
As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a bad place. By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.[23]The film was made on a production budget of about $15 million and shot in various parts of Los Angeles, beginning on September 25, 2010.[3][10][25] Locations were picked by Refn while Gosling drove him around the city at night. At the director's request, Los Angeles was picked as the shooting location due to budget constraints.[26] Refn moved into a plush Los Angeles home and insisted that the cast members and screenwriter Amini move in with him. They would work on the script and film all day, then watch films, edit, or drive at night.[27] Refn asked that the editing suite be placed in his home as well.[10] With a shooting script of 81 pages, Refn and Gosling continued to trim dialogue during filming.[17]
The opening chase scene, involving Gosling's character, was filmed primarily by Refn within the car's interior. In an interview, he said he intended for this scene to emulate the feeling of a ""diver in an ocean of sharks,"" and never left the vehicle during the car chase so that the audience can see what's happening from the character's point of view.[28] To economize money and time, he shot the scene in two days. With two different set-ups prepared in the car, the director found it difficult to have mobility with the camera, so he would switch the camera to two additional set-ups nearby. As downtown Los Angeles had been rejuvenated, Refn avoided certain areas to maintain the novel's gloomy atmosphere. The scene was shot at low angles with minimal light.[28]
The elevator sequence was shot without dialogue.[29] Refn explained:
A scene like the elevator sequence in Drive, for instance, has no dialogue, just a series of stunning visuals and graphic imagery – that's a prime example of how the film conveys so many ideas and emotions through images rather than words.— Matt Barone, Complex interview with Nicholas Winding Refn.[30]Before shooting the head-smashing scene, Refn spoke to Gaspar Noé and asked him how he had done a similar scene in his film Irréversible (2002).[10] Crossing the line from romance to violence, the scene begins with the Driver and Irene kissing tenderly. What they share is really a goodbye kiss.[31] The Driver becomes a kind of ""werewolf,""[32] violently stomping the hit man's head in. Irene sees the Driver in a new light.[29]
Of this scene, Refn said:
Every movie has to have a heart – a place where it defines itself – and in every movie I've made there's always a scene that does that. On Drive, it was hard for me to wrap my head around it. I realized I needed to show in one situation that Driver is the hopelessly romantic knight, but he's also completely psychotic and is willing to use any kind of violence to protect innocence. But that scene was never written. As I was going along, it just kind of popped up.[33]In March 2012, Interiors, an online journal concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, published an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene. The issue highlights Refn's use of constricted space and his way of creating a balance between romance and violence.[34]
Using an Arri Alexa camera, cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel shot the film digitally.[35] According to executive producer David Lancaster, the film has abundant, evocative, intense images of Los Angeles that are not often seen. ""From the little seen back streets of downtown LA to the dry arid outposts on the peaks of the desert landscape surrounding it, Siegel has re-imagined an LA all the way down to the rocky cliffs by the sea.""[36]
Car scenes were filmed with a ""biscuit rig,"" a camera car rig developed for the film Seabiscuit (2003). It allowed stunt driver Robert Nagle to steer the car, freeing Gosling to concentrate on acting.[37] Consistent with Refn's usual visual style, wide-angle lenses were used extensively by cinematographer Sigel, who avoided hand-held camera work.[36] Preferring to keep the film more ""grounded"" and authentic, he also avoided the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI). Budget restrictions were also a factor in this decision.[38]
Although many stunt drivers are credited, Gosling performed some stunts himself[39] after completing a stunt driving car crash course.[40] During the production, Gosling re-built the 1973 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu used in the film, taking it apart and putting it back together.[41][42] Filming concluded on November 12, 2010.[25][43]
Beth Mickle was hired as the film's production designer on Gosling's recommendation; they had worked together on 2006's Half Nelson. Prior to filming, Mickle supervised a crew of 40, routinely working 16- to 18-hour days. This was her most expensive film to date, and Mickle felt freer since ""there was another zero added to the budget,"" compared to that of Half Nelson.[44] The crew built the Driver's apartment building, which included a hallway and elevator that linked his unit to Irene's. Mickle also built a strip club set and Bernie Rose's apartment in an abandoned building. Turning a ""run-of-the-mill"" Los Angeles auto body shop into a grandiose dealership was one of the most challenging tasks. Painting the walls an electric blue color, she filled the showroom with vintage cars.[44]
While Drive is set in the present day, it has a 1980s atmosphere, underlined by the vehicles, music, and clothes, and by the architecture. The parts of the city seen in the Valley and near downtown Los Angeles are cheap stucco and mirrored glass; the film excludes buildings constructed more recently.[45] Drab background settings include the Southern California commercial strip. As the Los Angeles Times pointed out, whenever gleaming buildings are shown, it is because they are being seen from a distance. Refn shot those scenes from a helicopter at night in Bunker Hill, Los Angeles.[45]
Thinking back, there isn't really all that much driving in Drive – a couple of chase scenes here and there, staged efficiently, thrillingly. It's more about the questionable choices that drive people – and, ultimately, the ones that drive them away.
Andrew O'Hehir of Salon magazine described Drive as a ""classic Los Angeles heist-gone-wrong story,"" that ""isn't trying to outdo Bullitt or get the next assignment in The Fast and the Furious franchise"". O'Hehir also described homages to ""Roger Corman's B-movie aesthetic and the glossy Hollywood spectacles of Michael Mann"".[47] Steven Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times examined themes in the characters of ""loyalty, loneliness and the dark impulses that rise up even when we try our hardest to suppress them"".[29][48] Reuters' Nick Vinocur described a series of comic gore, resulting in ""a bizarre concoction ... reminiscent of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive ... Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, and [with] angst-laden love scenes that would not be out of place in a Scandinavian drama"".[27][49] Christopher Hawthorne, also from the Los Angeles Times, has compared it to the works of Walter Hill, John Carpenter, Nathanael West, J. G. Ballard, and Mike Davis.[45] According to Refn, Drive is dedicated to filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky and includes shades of Jodorowsky's existentialism.[10]
Drive has been described as a tough, hard-edged, neo-noir, art house feature,[10] extremely violent and very stylish, with European art and exploitation influences.[27][50] Drive also refers to 1970s and 1980s cult hits such as The Day of the Locust (1975)[45] and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). Other influences can be seen in the neon-bright opening credits and the retro song picks – ""a mix of tension-ratcheting synthesizer tones and catchy club anthems that collectively give the film its consistent tone"".[39] Drive's title sequence is hot-pink,[10] which was inspired by Risky Business (1983).[17] Refn has also indicated that the film's romance was partly inspired by the films of writer-director John Hughes.[51]
Refn's inspiration for Drive came partly from reading Grimms' Fairy Tales, and his goal was to make ""a fairy tale that takes Los Angeles as the background,""[10] with The Driver as the hero. To play with the common theme of fairy tales, The Driver protects what is good while at the same time killing degenerate people in violent ways.[29] Refn said Drive turns into a superhero film during the elevator scene when The Driver kills the villain.[41] The director said he was also inspired by films such as Point Blank (1967), Two-Lane Blacktop (1971), The Driver (1978), and Thief (1981). Jean-Pierre Melville's crime productions influenced the cinematography.[41] Amini's script imposes ""a kind of sideways moral code,"" where even those who comply with it are almost never rewarded for their efforts, as seen when The Driver helps Standard because of concern for Irene and her son.[29] In their vehicles, the characters not only make escapes or commit murder but try to find peace and search for romance.[29]
The Driver has been compared to the Man with No Name, a character portrayed by Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy, because he almost never speaks, communicating mostly non-verbally.[47] The Driver's meager dialogue is not designed to present him as tough, but to soften him. Refn chose to give The Driver very little dialogue and have him drive around listening to synth-pop music, taking control when it counts.[50] Peter Debruge of Variety opined that what The Driver lacks in psychology, he makes up through action and stylish costuming.[39] The Driver's wardrobe, in particular the satin jacket with the logo of a golden scorpion on the back, was inspired by the band Kiss, and Kenneth Anger's 1964 experimental film Scorpio Rising.[41] Refn sees the former as the character's armor, and the logo as a sign of protection.[52] According to reviewer Peter Canavese, the jacket is a reference to the fable of the Scorpion and the Frog, mentioned in the film, which evokes its use in the Orson Welles film Mr. Arkadin.[53]
Drive would later serve as a major influence for many elements of the 2012 game Hotline Miami, including the minimalist plot, protagonist, use of dialogue, portrayal of violence, and visual/musical style.
Refn chose Johnny Jewel of Desire and Chromatics to score the film.[54] The album consists of songs blended with electronic, ambient and retro music.[54] Although Jewel's music was used in the score, at the last minute the studio hired experienced score composer Cliff Martinez.[55] Refn gave him a sampling of songs he liked and asked Martinez to emulate the sound, resulting in ""a kind of retro, 80ish, synthesizer europop"". Most of its ethereal electronic-pop score was composed by Martinez.[56] The score contains tracks with vintage keyboards and bluntly descriptive titles.[57]
Drive (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) was released on CD on September 19, 2011, by Lakeshore Records.[58] Prior to that, owing to viral reviews such as those found on Twitter, the soundtrack sold well on iTunes, climbing as high as number four on the sales charts.[59] The album was released on vinyl in June 2012, by Mondo.[60] It received positive responses[61] and peaked the soundtrack list from Billboard[62] and Official Charts Company,[63] while also peaked at 30th position on the US Billboard 200.[64] A re-scored soundtrack for the film was produced for the BBC by Zane Lowe for its television broadcast in October 2014, which included original music from Chvrches, Banks, Bastille, Eric Prydz, SBTRKT, Bring Me the Horizon, The 1975 and Laura Mvula.[65]
In September 2016, Lakeshore and Invada Records released a fifth anniversary special edition pressing of the soundtrack, featuring new liner notes and artwork. That same month, Johnny Jewel, College, Electric Youth, and Cliff Martinez discussed the impact of the soundtrack and film on their lives and contemporary music culture. Jewel told Aaron Vehling that Drive's ""blend of sonic and visual nostalgia with a contemporary spin is always deadly.""[66] The soundtrack was listed on Spin magazine's list of 40 Movie Soundtracks That Changed Alternative Music.[67]
Prior to beginning principal photography, Refn went to the 2010 Cannes Film Festival to sell the rights to Drive and released promotional posters for the film.[14][68][69] In November 2010, FilmDistrict acquired North American distribution rights, the first major acquisition at the American Film Market that year, beating other studios including Summit Entertainment and Lionsgate.[25] The owners were so eager to get their hands on Drive, that they started negotiating to buy it before seeing any footage, believing it could appeal to people who enjoy a genre movie, as well as the arthouse crowd.[70] The film had a release date of September 16, 2011, in the United States.[25][71]
The film premiered on May 20, in competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.[49] At its first showing the film received abundant praise[72] and ""some of the best responses of the festival,""[73] but Xan Brooks of The Guardian, who gave it a positive review, said it ""can't win, won't win"" Cannes's top prize.[50] Brooks explained that ""[I]t's too self-consciously retro, too much a series of cool, blank surfaces as opposed to a rounded, textured drama,"" but said that it was his ""guilty pleasure"" of the 2011 competition, labeling it an enjoyable affair. He said,
Over the past 10 days we've witnessed great art and potent social commentary; the birth of the cosmos and the end of the world. Turns out what we really wanted all along was a scene in which a man gets his head stomped in a lift. They welcome it in like a long-lost relation.[49]The film was greeted with hoots and howls of joy from the media, with viewers cheering on some of the scenes featuring extreme violence.[27][47] Drive received a 15-minute standing ovation from the crowd.[74] The festival awarded Refn best director for Drive.[75]
Drive was screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival (LAFF) on June 20 at its gala screenings program. It was among more than 200 feature films, short projects, and music videos, from more than 30 countries, to be shown during the festival.[76] After Red Dog's release date was pushed up by several days, Drive replaced it as the Melbourne International Film Festival's closing night film.[77] The film was also screened during FilmDistrict's studio panel presentation at San Diego Comic-Con.[78] A secret screening for Drive was held at London's Empire Big Screen during the middle of August.[41] In September, Drive screened as a special presentation during the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival, alongside another film starring Gosling, The Ides of March.[79]
Drive grossed $81.4 million worldwide.[4] In North America, the film grossed a total of $35.1 million.[4] The film opened in North America earning $11.3 million on the weekend of September 16, 2011, and played at 2,866 theaters. It was one of four wide releases that opened that weekend and came in second. The other three new releases included the re-release of The Lion King on 3D, which was the top film, along with the Straw Dogs remake and the romantic comedy I Don't Know How She Does It.[80] The film closed its North American theatrical run on February 9, 2012.[81]
In the international marketplace, Drive grossed $46.3 million.[4] The film had its highest-grossing box office in France, where it earned a total of €10.3 million ($13.3 million).[82] It opened in France on the weekend of October 5, 2011, at 246 theaters, eventually expanding to 360. The film opened in second place and had the highest per-screen theater gross for the weekend €10,722 ($13,786).[83] Its second-highest overseas gross came in the United Kingdom, where it earned a total of £3.1 million ($4.6 million).[84] Drive opened in the United Kingdom on September 27, 2011, at 176 theaters, eventually expanding to 190.[85] The film opened in Australia on October 27, 2011, and grossed a total of $2.3 million in the country.[86]
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 93% based on 270 reviews, and an average rating of 8.30/10. The site's critical consensus states, ""With its hyper-stylized blend of violence, music, and striking imagery, Drive represents a fully realized vision of arthouse action.""[87] Metacritic, another review aggregator, gave it a score of 79 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating ""generally favorable"" reviews.[88] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""C−"" on an A+ to F scale.[89]
It was one of the highest-ranked, and most-featured, films on critics' year-end top 10 lists. It ranked as the fourth-best film of the year, behind The Tree of Life, The Artist, and Melancholia on Metacritic's tally of top 10 lists.[90] Drive was picked as the best film of the year by: Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times, James Rocchi of BoxOffice, Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out (New York), Neil Miller of Film School Rejects, Mark Russell of The Oregonian, and a staff critic from Empire magazine.[91]
The writers for the film magazine Empire listed Drive as their number one film of 2011.[92] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, declaring that Drive was ""a brilliant piece of nasty business,"" and that ""Refn is a virtuoso, blending tough and tender with such uncanny skill that he deservedly won the Best Director prize at Cannes."" Travers also said, ""Prepare to be blown away by Albert Brooks. Brooks' performance, veined with dark humor and chilling menace (watch him with a blade), deserves to have Oscar calling.""[93][94] The Wall Street Journal's Joe Morgenstern also praised Brooks's performance, calling his villainous performance ""sensational.""[95] James Rocchi of The Playlist gave the film an ""A"" letter grade, and wrote that ""Drive works as a great demonstration of how, when there's true talent behind the camera, entertainment and art are not enemies but allies.""[96] Rocchi placed Drive as his number one film of 2011.[97]
Movieline's Stephanie Zacharek rated the film 9.5 out of 10, complimenting the film's action and writing that it ""defies all the current trends in mainstream action filmmaking. The driving sequences are shot and edited with a surgeon's clarity and precision. Refn doesn't chop up the action to fool us into thinking it's more exciting than it is."" She also admired Refn's skill in handling the film's violence and the understated romance between Gosling and Mulligan.[98] Drive was Roger Ebert's seventh-best film of 2011. In praising the film, he wrote, ""Here is a movie with respect for writing, acting, and craft. It has respect for knowledgeable moviegoers."" Like Zacharek, Ebert admired the film's action sequences, which were practically made and did not rely on CGI effects.[99][100]
Anthony Lane wrote in The New Yorker that Drive's violence was far too graphic, and this ultimately was a detriment to the film. Referring to the violence, he said, ""In grabbing our attention, he diverts it from what matters. The horror lingers and seeps; the feelings are sponged away.""[101] Michael Philips of the Chicago Tribune felt similarly, and said that although he enjoyed the film in the early sections, it became ""one garishly sadistic set piece after another"". Phillips thought the film relied too much on ""stylistic preening"" and did not have enough substance.[102]
In 2014, The Huffington Post included Drive on its list of 8 Movies From The Last 15 Years That Are Super Overrated, with Bill Bradley criticizing the low amount of dialogue by Gosling's character and writing that ""Refn spends all 100 minutes trying to convince you that he has a cool iPod playlist.""[103] WhatCulture included Ryan Gosling's role in top ""10 Most Convincing Movie Psychopath Performances"".[104]
In 2025, it was one of the films voted for the ""Readers' Choice"" edition of The New York Times' list of ""The 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century,"" finishing at number 129.[105] In 2025, The Hollywood Reporter listed Drive as having the best stunts of 2011.[106]
Drive was nominated for four British Academy Film Awards, which included Best Film, Best Direction, Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Carey Mulligan), and Best Editing. It was one of the most-nominated films by critics' groups in 2011.[107][108] Albert Brooks had the most nominations from critics' groups.[108][109] Refn won the Best Director Award at the 64th Cannes Film Festival.[110] The film also received an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound Editing.[111]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb_(identifier),IMDb,"
IMDb, historically known as the Internet Movie Database, is an online database of information related to films, television series, podcasts, video games, and streaming content online – including cast, production crew and biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. As of September 2025, IMDb ranks as the 40th most visited website in the world and the 35th in the United States.[2][3]
The database contained some 25.9 million titles, and 14.8 million person records as of September 2025.[4][5]
User profile pages show a user's registration date and, optionally, their personal ratings of titles. Since 2015, ""badges"" can be added showing a count of contributions. These badges range from total contributions made to independent categories such as photos, trivia, and biographies. If a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an IMDb page, they can add photos through IMDbPRO.[6]
The IMDb Top 250 is a list of the top rated 250 films, based on ratings by registered users of the website using the methods described. As of June 11, 2025[update], The Shawshank Redemption (1994), directed by Frank Darabont, is the highest-ranked film on the list, and has been since 2008.[7][8][9] The ""Top 250"" rating is based on only the ratings of ""regular voters"". The number of votes a registered user would have to make to be considered as a user who votes regularly has been kept secret. IMDb has stated that to maintain the effectiveness of the Top 250 list they ""deliberately do not disclose the criteria used for a person to be counted as a regular voter"".[10] In addition to other weightings, the Top 250 films are also based on a weighted rating formula referred to in actuarial science as a credibility formula.[11] This label arises because a statistic is taken to be more credible the greater the number of individual pieces of information; in this case from eligible users who submit ratings. Although the current formula is not disclosed, IMDb originally used the following formula to calculate their weighted rating:[12]
The IMDb also has a Bottom 100 feature which is assembled through a similar process although only 10,000 votes must be received to qualify for the list.[13]
The Top 250 list comprises a wide range of feature films, including major releases, cult films, independent films, critically acclaimed films, silent films, and non-English-language films. Documentaries, short films and TV episodes are not currently included.
Since 2015, there has been a Top 250 list devoted to ranking television shows.[14]
IMDb originally used a more sidebar/list-based view on title pages. However, in 2010 the site updated pages to more free-flowing layouts, and offered logged-in users an ""advanced view"" site preference setting called ""Combined view"", or this could be done on an ad-hoc basis by simply adding /combined to the end of the URL (e.g. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2358891/combined), for users to choose should they prefer the older page view display method or to aid the editing of data.
In 2017, some alterations were made to this advanced view, and the setting was renamed ""Reference view"", again also able to be accessed ad-hoc by simply adding /reference to the end of the URL (e.g. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2358891/reference), with the former /combined URLs made to link to the newer /reference ones.[15]
By February 20, 2017, all the message boards and their content were permanently removed. According to the website, the decision was made because the boards were ""no longer providing a positive, useful experience for the vast majority of our more than 250 million monthly users worldwide"".[16] Others have mentioned its susceptibility to trolling and disagreeable behavior.[17][18][19] Needham also mentioned in a post some months earlier that the boards received less income from ads, and that their members only made up a very small part of the website's visitors. The boards were costly to run due to the system's age and dated design, which did not make business sense.[20] The decision to remove the message boards was met with outspoken backlash from some of its users, and sparked an online petition garnering over 8,000 signatures.[21] In the days leading up to February 20, 2017, both Archive.org[22] and MovieChat.org[23] preserved the entire contents of the IMDb message boards using web scraping. Archive.org and MovieChat.org have published IMDb message board archives.[24]
Actors, crew, and industry executives can post their own resume and upload photos of themselves for a yearly membership fee to IMDbPro. IMDbPro can be accessed by anyone willing to pay the annual fee of US$149.99. Membership enables a user to access the rank order of each industry personality, as well as agent contact information for any actor, producer, director etc. that has an IMDb page. IMDbPro also allows existing actors to claim their name page, as well as production companies to claim titles they own/manage. Enrolling in IMDbPro enables members who are industry personnel to upload a head shot to open their page, as well as to upload hundreds of photos to accompany their page. Anyone can register as an IMDb user and contribute to the site as well as view its content; however, those users enrolled in IMDbPro have greater access and privileges.[25]
IMDb began as a fan-operated movie database on the Usenet group ""rec.arts.movies"" in 1990, and moved to the Web in 1993.
IMDb originated in 1990 with a Usenet posting entitled ""Those Eyes"", by the English film fan and computer programmer Col Needham,[26][failed verification] about actresses with beautiful eyes.
By late 1990, the lists included almost 10,000 films and television series, correlated with actors and actresses appearing therein. On October 17, 1990, Needham converted his private database to an entity that was accessible on the Internet, and thus the database that would become the IMDb was born.[27] At the time, it was known as the ""rec.arts.movies movie database"".
The database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material as well as trivia, biographies, and plot summaries. The movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data, and a centralized email interface for querying the database had been created by Alan Jay. Later, on August 5, 1993,[28] it moved onto the fledgling World Wide Web under the name of Cardiff Internet Movie Database.[29] The database resided on the servers of the computer science department of Cardiff University in Wales. Rob Hartill was the original web interface author. In 1994, the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information, which enabled people to email the specific list maintainer with their updates. However, the structure remained so that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers, the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein. Over the next few years, the database was run on a network of mirrors across the world with donated bandwidth.[30]
In 1996, IMDb was incorporated in the United Kingdom, becoming the Internet Movie Database Ltd. Founder Col Needham became the primary owner. General revenue for site operations was generated through advertising, licensing and partnerships.[31]
In 1998, Jeff Bezos, founder, owner, and CEO of Amazon.com, struck a deal with Needham and other principal shareholders to buy IMDb outright; Amazon paid $55 million for IMDb and two other companies.[32] Bezos attached it to Amazon as a subsidiary, private company.[33] This gave IMDb the ability to pay the shareholders salaries for their work.[clarify] In the process of expanding its product line, Amazon.com intended to use IMDb as an advertising resource for selling DVDs and videotapes.
From 1996 onwards, an annual newsletter email (archived on the website) has been sent from Col Needham to contributors on the first day of each calendar year. The annual newsletter lists various information about the past year on the site, including stats, top contributors tally for the year (the top 300 users, currently; fewer in previous years), and a perspective on the site's progress and future.[34][35][36]
As an additional incentive for users, as of 2003[update], users identified as one of the ""top 100 contributors"" of hard data received complimentary free access to IMDbPro for the following calendar year; for 2006 this was increased to the top 150 contributors, and for 2010 to the top 250.[37]
In 2008, IMDb launched their first official foreign-language version with IMDb.de, in German. Also in 2008, IMDb acquired two other companies: Withoutabox[38] and Box Office Mojo.[39]
The website was originally Perl-based, but IMDb no longer discloses what software it uses for reasons of security, apart from mentioning The Apache Software Foundation.[40] In 2010, the site was filtered in China.[41]
In 2016, The IMDb Studio at Sundance was launched, a talk show that is presented on IMDb and YouTube.[42][43]
The site's message boards were disabled in February 2017. In April 2017, IMDb celebrated its 25th anniversary. As of that year, Needham was still managing IMDb from its main office in Bristol in the Castlemead office tower.[44]
In January 2019, IMDb launched an ad-supported streaming service called Freedive.[45] This was the company's second attempt at a streaming service; it launched a similar service in 2008.[46][47] In June 2019, Freedive was rebranded as IMDb TV.[48] In April 2022, the service was rebranded again as Amazon Freevee.[49] On December 30, 2024, it was closed as an independent site and its content was merged into Amazon Prime Video.[50]
In 2006, IMDb introduced its ""Résumé Subscription Service"", where an actor or crew member can post their résumé and upload photos[51] for a yearly fee.[52] IMDb résumé pages are kept on a sub-page of the regular entry about that person, with a regular entry automatically created for each résumé subscriber who does not already have one.[53]
Volunteers who contribute content to the database technically retain copyright on their contributions, but the compilation of the content becomes the exclusive property of IMDb with the full right to copy, modify, and sublicense it, and they are verified before posting.[54] However, credit is not given on specific title or filmography pages to the contributor(s) who have provided information. Conversely, a credited text entry, such as a plot summary, may be corrected for content, grammar, sentence structure, perceived omission or error, by other contributors without having to add their names as co-authors. Due to the time required for processing submitted data or text before it is displayed, IMDb is different from user-contributed projects like Discogs, or OpenStreetMap, or Wikipedia, in that contributors cannot add, delete, or modify the data or text on impulse, and the manipulation of data is controlled by IMDb technology and salaried staff.[55]
IMDb has been subject to deliberate additions of false information; in 2012 a spokesperson said: ""We make it easy for users and professionals to update much of our content, which is why we have an 'edit page'. The data that is submitted goes through a series of consistency checks before it goes live. Given the sheer volume of the information, occasional mistakes are inevitable, and, when reported, they are promptly fixed. We always welcome corrections.""[56]
The Java Movie Database (JMDB)[57] is reportedly creating an IMDb_Error.log file that lists all the errors found while processing the IMDb plain text files. A Wiki alternative to IMDb is Open Media Database[58] whose content is also contributed by users but licensed under a Creative Commons license (CC BY) and the GFDL. Since 2007, IMDb has been experimenting with wiki-programmed sections for complete film synopses, parental guides, and FAQs about titles as determined by (and answered by) individual contributors.
IMDb, unlike other AI-automated queries, does not provide an API for automated queries. However, most of the data can be downloaded as compressed plain text files and the information can be extracted using the command-line interface tools provided.[59] There is also a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) application available that is able to process the compressed plain text files, which allows a search and a display of the information.[57] This GUI application supports different languages, but the movie related data are in English, as made available by IMDb. A Python package called IMDbPY (since renamed cinemagoer) can also be used to process the compressed plain text files into a number of different SQL databases, enabling easier access to the entire dataset for searching or data mining.[60][61][62]
On October 21, 2021, the site added the ability to add podcasts (both as series and episodes) as titles to the site, via an IMDb employee announcement on their Sprinklr forums.[63] As of December 2022[update], the numbers of podcast series stood at 24,778, with podcast episodes at 3,076,386.[4]
Annually, IMDb STARmeter Awards are presented to industry professionals in various categories. Professionals who have appeared in its annual ""top 10 lists"" are considered for this award. ""IMDb determines its definitive top 10 lists using data from IMDbPro STARmeter rankings, which are based on the actual page views of the more than 200 million monthly visitors to the site.""[64] Initially IMDb STARmeter Awards were given in two categories, IMDb Fan favorite STARmeter Award and IMDb Breakout STARmeter Award.[65] Celebrating 20th anniversary of IMDbPro, it launched IMDb Icon STARmeter Award, which is given to prominent artists of the industry who have appeared in the top 10 positions throughout the year.[66] Salma Hayek received the inaugural award.[66]
In 2011, in the case of Hoang v. Amazon.com, Inc., IMDb was sued by an anonymous actress for at least US$1,075,000 because the movie website publicly disclosed her age (40, at the time) without her consent.[67] The actress claimed that revealing her age could cause her to lose acting opportunities.[68] Judge Marsha J. Pechman, a US district judge in Seattle, dismissed the lawsuit, saying the actress had no grounds to proceed with an anonymous complaint. The actress re-filed and so revealed that she was Huong Hoang of Texas, who uses the stage name Junie Hoang.[69] In 2013, Pechman dismissed all causes of action except for a breach of contract claim against IMDb; a jury then sided with IMDb on that claim.[70] The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court judgment in March 2015.[71]
Also in 2011, in the case of United Video Properties Inc., et al. v. Amazon.Com Inc. et al.,[72] IMDb and Amazon were sued by Rovi Corporation and others for patent infringement over their various program listing offerings.[73] The patent claims were ultimately construed in a way favorable to IMDb, and Rovi / United Video Properties lost the case.[74] In April 2014, the decision was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.[75]
In January 2017, the State of California enacted state bill AB-1687, a SAG-AFTRA-backed anti-ageism statute which requires ""commercial online entertainment employment services"" to honor requests by their subscribers for their ages and birthdays to be hidden.[76] By the beginning of 2017, IMDb had received more than 2,300 requests from individuals to remove their date of birth from the site. Included in this group were 10 Academy Award winners and another 71 nominated for Oscars, Emmys, or Golden Globes.[77] On February 23, 2017, Judge Vince Girdhari Chhabria issued a stay on the bill pending a further trial, on the ground that it possibly violated the First Amendment because it inhibited the public consumption of information. He also questioned the intent of the bill, as it was ostensibly meant to target IMDb.[78] In February 2018, Chhabria struck down the statute,[79] and in June 2020, the Ninth Circuit affirmed Chhabria's judgement, holding that the statute was an unconstitutional content-based restriction that violated the First Amendment.[80][81]
IMDb had long maintained that it would keep all valid information, but changed that policy related to birth names in 2019, instead removing birth names that are not widely and publicly known, of persons who no longer use their birth names.[82] This was done in response to pressure from LGBTQ groups against the publication of the birth names of transgender people without their consent (deadnaming). Any name a person had previously been credited under, however, continues to be maintained in the credits section.[82]
As of 28 March 2025[update], IMDb tracked 13 categories:[4]
"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Award_for_Best_Male_Newcomer,Empire Award for Best Male Newcomer,"
The Empire Award for Best Male Newcomer is an Empire Award presented annually by the British film magazine Empire to honor an actor who has delivered a breakthrough performance[1] while working within the film industry. The Empire Award for Best Male Newcomer is one of two ongoing awards which were first introduced at the 17th Empire Awards ceremony in 2012 (along with Best Female Newcomer) with Tom Hiddleston receiving the award for his role in Thor. Josh O'Connor is the most recent winner in this category for his role in God's Own Country. Winners are voted by the readers of Empire magazine.
In the list below, winners are listed first in boldface, followed by the other nominees. The number of the ceremony (1st, 2nd, etc.) appears in parentheses after the awards year, linked to the article (if any) on that ceremony.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verification,Wikipedia:Verifiability,"
In the English Wikipedia, verifiability means that people can check that facts or claims correspond to reliable sources. Wikipedia's content is determined by published information rather than editors' beliefs, experiences, or previously unpublished ideas or information. Even if you are sure something is true, it must have been previously published in a reliable source before you can add it.[a] If reliable sources disagree with each other, then maintain a neutral point of view and present what the various sources say, giving each side its due weight.
Each fact or claim in an article must be verifiable. Additionally, four types of information must be accompanied by an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] the material:
When material that needs an inline citation appears in two or more articles, an inline citation is needed in each.
Any material that needs an inline citation but does not have one may be removed. Please immediately remove contentious material about living people (or existing groups) that is unsourced or poorly sourced.
For how to write citations, see citing sources. Verifiability, no original research, and neutral point of view are Wikipedia's core content policies. They work together to determine content, so editors should understand the key points of all three. Articles must also comply with the copyright policy.
All content must be verifiable.  A fact or claim is ""verifiable"" if a reliable source that supports it could be cited, even if there is no citation for it in the article at the moment. The burden to demonstrate verifiability lies with the editor who adds or restores material, and it is satisfied by providing an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] the contribution.[c]
The cited source must clearly support the material as presented in the article. Cite the source clearly, ideally giving page number(s)—though sometimes a section, chapter, or other division may be appropriate instead; see Wikipedia:Citing sources for details of how to do this.
Facts or claims without an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] them may be removed. They should not be restored without an inline citation to a reliable source. 
Whether or how quickly material should be removed for lacking an inline citation to a reliable source depends on the material and the overall state of the article. Consider adding a citation needed tag as an interim step to removing unsourced material, to allow references to be added.[d] When tagging or removing material for lacking an inline citation, state your concern that it may not be possible to find a published reliable source, and the material therefore may not be verifiable.[e] If you think the material is verifiable, you are encouraged to provide an inline citation yourself before removing or tagging it.
Do not leave unsourced or poorly sourced material in an article if it might damage the reputation of living people or existing groups, and do not move it to the talk page. Be aware of how Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons also applies to groups.
A cited source on Wikipedia is often a specific portion of text (such as a short article or a page in a book). But when editors discuss sources (for example, to debate their appropriateness or reliability) they are usually talking about one or more related characteristics:
All four can affect reliability.
Base articles on reliable, independent, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Source material must be published, on Wikipedia meaning made available to the public in some form.[f] Unpublished material is not considered reliable. Use sources that directly support the material presented in an article and are appropriate to the claims made. The appropriateness of any source depends on the context. Be especially careful when sourcing content related to living people or medicine.
If available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources on topics such as history, medicine, and science.
Editors may also use material from reliable non-academic sources, particularly if it appears in respected mainstream publications. Other reliable sources include:
Editors may also use electronic media, subject to the same criteria (see details in Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources).
The best sources have a professional structure for checking or analyzing facts, legal issues, evidence, and arguments. The greater the degree of scrutiny given to these issues, the more reliable the source.
Some newspapers, magazines, and other news organizations host online pages or columns they call blogs. These may be acceptable sources if the writers are professionals, but use them with caution because blogs may not be subject to the news organization's normal fact-checking process.[g] If a news organization publishes an opinion piece in a blog, attribute the statement to the writer, e.g. ""Jane Smith wrote ..."" Never use the blog comments that are left by the readers as sources. For personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources, see § Self-published sources below.
To discuss the reliability of a specific source for a particular statement, consult Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard, which seeks to apply this policy to particular cases. For a guideline discussing the reliability of particular types of sources, see Wikipedia:Reliable sources. In case of conflict between this policy and the Wikipedia:Reliable sources guideline, or any other guideline related to sourcing, this policy has priority.
Questionable sources are those that have a poor reputation for checking the facts, lack meaningful editorial oversight, or have an apparent conflict of interest.
Such sources include websites and publications expressing views widely considered by other sources to be promotional, extremist, or that rely heavily on unsubstantiated gossip, rumor, or personal opinion. Questionable sources should be used only as sources for material on themselves, such as in articles about themselves; see below. They are not suitable sources for contentious claims.
Predatory open access journals are questionable due to the absence of quality control in the peer-review process.
Anyone can create a personal web page, self-publish a book, or claim to be an expert. Self-published material, such as books, patents, newsletters, personal websites, open wikis, personal or group blogs (as distinguished from newsblogs, above), content farms, podcasts, Internet forum postings, and social media postings, are largely not acceptable as sources. Self-published sources may be considered reliable if published by an established subject-matter expert, whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable, independent publications.[g] Be careful when using such sources: if the information in question is suitable for inclusion, someone else will likely have published it in independent, reliable sources.[1] Never use self-published sources as third-party sources about living people, even if the author is an expert, well-known professional researcher, or writer.
Self-published and questionable sources may be used as sources of information about themselves, usually in articles about themselves or their activities, without the self-published source requirement that they are established experts in the field, so long as:
This policy also applies to material made public by the source on social networking websites such as Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Reddit, Instagram and Facebook.
Do not use articles from Wikipedia (whether English Wikipedia or Wikipedias in other languages) as sources, since Wikipedia is a user-generated source. Do not use websites mirroring Wikipedia content or publications relying on material from Wikipedia as sources. Content from a Wikipedia article is not considered reliable unless it is backed up by citing reliable sources. Confirm that these sources support the content, then use them directly.[2]
An exception is allowed when Wikipedia itself is being discussed in the article. These may cite content from Wikipedia or a sister project to support a statement about Wikipedia. Wikipedia or the sister project is a primary source in this case and may be used following the policy for primary sources. Any such use should avoid original research, undue emphasis on Wikipedia's role or views, and inappropriate self-reference. The article text should say that the material is sourced from Wikipedia.
Do not reject reliable sources just because they are difficult or costly to access. Some reliable sources are not easily accessible. For example, an online source may require payment, and a print-only source may be available only through libraries. Rare historical sources may even be available only in special museum collections and archives. If you have trouble accessing a source, others might do so for you (see WikiProject Resource Exchange).

Citations to non-English reliable sources are allowed on the English Wikipedia. However, because this project is in English, English-language sources are preferred over non-English ones when they are available and of equal quality and relevance. As with sources in English, if a dispute arises involving a citation to a non-English source, editors may request a quotation of relevant portions of the original source be provided, either in text, in a footnote, or on the article talk page.[h] (See Template:Request quotation.)

If you quote a non-English reliable source (whether in the main text or in a footnote), a translation into English should accompany the quote. Translations published by reliable sources are preferred over translations by Wikipedians, but translations by Wikipedians are preferred over machine translations. When using a machine translation of source material, editors should be reasonably certain that the translation is accurate and the source is appropriate. Editors should not rely upon machine translations of non-English sources in contentious articles or biographies of living people. If needed, ask an editor who can translate it for you.
The original text is usually included with the translated text in articles when translated by Wikipedians, and the translating editor is usually not cited. When quoting any material, whether in English or in some other language, be careful not to violate copyright; see the fair-use guideline.
While information must be verifiable for inclusion in an article, not all verifiable information must be included. Consensus may determine that inclusion of a verifiable fact or claim does not improve an article, and other policies may indicate that the material is inappropriate. Such information should be omitted or presented instead in a different article.
The responsibility for achieving consensus for inclusion is on those seeking to include disputed content.
If you want to request an inline citation for an unsourced statement, you can tag a sentence with the {{citation needed}} template. You can also leave a note on the talk page asking for a source, or move the material to the talk page and ask for a source there. To request verification that a reference supports the text, tag it with {{verification needed}}. Material that fails verification may be tagged with {{failed verification}} or removed. It helps other editors to explain your rationale for using templates to tag material in the template, edit summary, or on the talk page.
Take special care with contentious material about living and recently deceased people. Unsourced or poorly sourced material that is contentious, especially text that is negative, derogatory, or potentially damaging, should be removed immediately rather than tagged or moved to the talk page.

Any exceptional claim requires multiple high-quality sources.[3] Warnings (red flags) that should prompt extra caution include:
Do not plagiarize or breach copyright when using sources. Summarize source material in your own words as much as possible; when quoting or closely paraphrasing a source, use an inline citation, and in-text attribution where appropriate.
Do not link to any source that violates the copyrights of others per contributors' rights and obligations. You can link to websites that display copyrighted works as long as the website has licensed the work or uses the work in a way compliant with fair use. Knowingly directing others to material that violates copyright may be considered contributory copyright infringement. If there is reason to think a source violates copyright, do not cite it. This is particularly relevant when linking to sites such as Scribd or YouTube, where due care should be taken to avoid linking to material violating copyright.
Even when information is cited to reliable sources, you must present it with a neutral point of view (NPOV). Articles should be based on thorough research of sources. All articles must adhere to NPOV, fairly representing all majority and significant-minority viewpoints published by reliable sources, in rough proportion to the prominence of each view. Tiny-minority views need not be included, except in articles devoted to them. If there is a disagreement between sources, use in-text attribution: ""John Smith argues X, while Paul Jones maintains Y,"" followed by an inline citation. Sources themselves do not need to maintain a neutral point of view. Indeed, many reliable sources are not neutral. Our job as editors is simply to summarize what reliable sources say.
If no reliable, independent sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it (i.e., the topic is not notable).
However, notability is based on the existence of suitable sources, not on the state of sourcing in an article.
The no original research policy (NOR) is closely related to the Verifiability policy. Among its requirements are:
"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold,Wikipedia:Be bold,"
We would like everyone to be bold and help make Wikipedia a better encyclopedia. How many times have you read something and thought—Why doesn't this page have correct spelling, proper grammar, or a better layout? Wikis like ours develop faster when everybody helps to fix problems, correct grammar, add facts, make sure wording is accurate, etc.
Fix it yourself instead of just talking about it. In the time it takes to write about the problem, you could instead improve the encyclopedia. Wikipedia not only lets you add and edit articles: it wants you to do it.
Do not feel upset if your bold edits get reverted. Of course, others here will edit what you write. Do not take it personally! They, like all of us, just wish to make Wikipedia as good an encyclopedia as it can be. Also, when you see a conflict in a talk page, don't just be a ""mute spectator""; be bold and add your opinion there; see the official policy on talking and editing for more! On some of the less prominent articles on Wikipedia that have a lower editing rate, your bold edit might not be responded to immediately. Think about it this way: if you don't find one of your edits being reverted now and then, perhaps you're not being bold enough.

Although the boldness of contributors like you is one of Wikipedia's greatest assets, it is important that you take care of the common good and not edit disruptively or recklessly. Of course, any changes you make that turn out badly can be reverted easily, usually painlessly, and it is important not to feel insulted if your changes are reverted or edited further. However, some significant changes can be long-lasting and harder to fix. If you're unsure of anything, just ask for advice.
Also, changes to articles on complex, controversial subjects with long histories or active sanctions, or to Featured Articles and Good Articles, should be done with extra care. In many cases, the text as you find it has come into being after long and arduous negotiations between Wikipedians of diverse backgrounds and points of view. A careless edit to such an article might stir up a latent conflict, and other users who are involved in the page may become defensive. If you would like to make a significant edit—not just a simple copyedit—to an article on a controversial subject, it is a useful idea to first read the article in its entirety and skim the comments on the talk page. On controversial articles, the safest course is to be cautious and find consensus before making changes; but there are nevertheless situations in which bold edits can safely be made, even to contentious articles. Always use your very best editorial judgment in these cases and be sure to read the talk page.
Being bold is never an excuse to violate the policy on material about living persons.

Often it is easier to see that something is not right rather than to know exactly what would be right. We do not require anyone to be bold; after all, commenting that something is incorrect can be the first step to getting it fixed. It is true, though, that problems are more certain to be fixed, and will probably be fixed faster, if you are bold and do it yourself.
Although editors are encouraged to be bold in updating articles, more caution is sometimes required when editing pages in non-article namespaces. Such pages are identified by a namespace prefix. For example, this page, Wikipedia:Be bold, has the ""Wikipedia:"" prefix; if it were called simply Be bold (with no prefix) it would be an article. 
Problems may arise for a variety of reasons in different contexts in non-article namespaces. These problems should be taken into account in deciding whether to be bold, and how bold to be.
Wikipedia does not ""enshrine"" old practices: bold changes to its policies and guidelines are sometimes the best way to adapt and improve the encyclopedia. In this case, ""bold"" refers to boldness of idea; such ideas are most commonly raised and discussed first to best formulate their implementation.
The admonition ""be careful"" is especially important in relation to policies and guidelines, where key parts may be phrased in a particular way to reflect a very hard-won compromise—which may not be obvious to those unfamiliar with the background. In these cases, it is also often better to discuss potential changes first. However, spelling and grammatical errors can and should be fixed as soon as they are noticed. 
Discussing changes to other Wikipedia-space pages on the talk page is also a good idea. If nothing else, it will provide an explanation of the changes for later editors. Most such pages are collections of arguments placed in Wikipedia space for later reference, so the same arguments don't need to be made over and over again.
One must be especially careful when being bold with templates: updating them can have far-reaching consequences because one change can affect lots of pages at once. Moreover, some templates are part of a wide-ranging, uniform system of templates across Wikipedia, e.g. infoboxes and stubs. Remember, all source code is easily broken by untested changes (but always quite fixable).
Because of these concerns, many heavily used templates are indefinitely protected from editing. Before editing templates, consider proposing any changes on the associated talk pages and announcing the proposed change on pages of appropriate WikiProjects. Templates often have associated sandbox and testcases pages; respectively these are a place for the proposed modified template, and a place where the proposal may be trialed in comparison with the existing version.
Creating new categories or reorganizing the category structure may come to affect many pages. Consider the guidelines on categorization and overcategorization, and if what you're doing might be considered controversial (especially if it concerns categories for living people), propose changes at Categories for discussion, also mentioning them on pages of appropriate WikiProjects.
Be bold in adding information to the description of an existing image. However, new images should be uploaded with new names rather than overwriting old ones. Doing otherwise risks having the old image confused with the new one. Therefore, you must always be careful.
It is generally recommended that you do not edit another Wikipedian's user page or comments left on talk pages (other than your own, and even then do not be reckless). Fixing vandalism is nearly always welcome, even on user pages. Specific users will let you know if they find your changes inappropriate or if you have given incorrect information.
Regarding changes to graphical layout? See the next section. Note that the color scheme used for portals is not necessarily arbitrary. For example, most portals related to countries use the colors of the nation's flag. It is a good idea to propose design changes on the talk page first.
Making major changes to the graphical layout of certain pages that are not articles requires caution (examples below). It is often best to test changes first (in a sandbox page in your userspace, or a subpage of the page in question), and to discuss the proposed change with other editors before making it live. When many users edit pages for layout, different plans can conflict, and the page may get worse rather than better.
This is particularly true of highly visible pages, such as those linked from the navigation boxes on the left of the screen. These often use intricate formatting to convey their information, and a lot of work has gone into making them as user-friendly as possible. Moreover, some pages form groups whose formatting is intended to be uniform. You should establish consensus before making design edits to these types of pages. Examples include the Main Page (which in any case is permanently protected), the Community Portal, the Featured content group of pages, and the group consisting of Wikipedia:Contents and its subpages, as well as Portal:Current events. This does not apply to articles or normal portals.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:TAGBOMB,Wikipedia:Tag bombing,"Tag bombing is the unjustified addition of numerous tags to pages or unjustified addition of one tag to multiple pages. Tag bombing is a form of disruptive editing. Editors who engage in tag bombing after being asked to stop may be blocked from editing Wikipedia. While some tag bombing may be a well-intended request for clarification, tag bombing can be used as a way to promote a point of view.
Adding tags to articles should be accompanied by sufficient reasoning on the tagged article's talk page (or in a ""reason"" parameter where one exists) to explain why the tags are needed. However, tag bombing does not apply to the moderate use of tags that are self-explanatory because having the same information on the talk page is a redundancy. For example, the tag {{unreferenced}} says ""This article does not cite any references or sources. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed."" There may be nothing more to say about an unreferenced article. The article either has sources or it does not have sources. There is no need to add {{citation needed}} tags to numerous unreferenced statements in an article when {{unreferenced}} or {{refimprove}} would state equivalent information. Tags like {{cleanup}}, on the other hand, say only a little more than ""This may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards"" and direct an editor to the Manual of Style, which contains myriad  possible issues. The use of these tags may be enhanced by the use of an argument of what points in the Manual of Style need to be addressed.
To avoid tag-bombing:
To tag-bomb, simply get a bunch of useless maintenance templates and place them right at the top. You may group them into a {{Multiple issues}} template or you may not group them. You can also spread inline cleanup tags like {{Citation needed}}, {{Unreliable source?}}, {{Better source}}, {{Or?}}, and {{Self-published inline}}. Once you press the ""Publish changes"" button, you can find that the screen is exploded full of maintenance templates. After successful tag bombing, repeat it as much as you want. Use other articles. Remember: you can do it up to 7,083,930 times and this is really fun! Just make sure the admins don't find out about this.
An extreme example of tag bombing was found at List of Magic: The Gathering keywords, which contained a total of 150 maintenance templates and a maintenance template saying that it had too many maintenance templates.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Chirac,Jacques Chirac,"
Jacques René Chirac (UK: /ˈʃɪəræk/,[1][2] US: /ʒɑːk ʃɪəˈrɑːk/ ⓘ;[2][3][4] French: [ʒak ʁəne ʃiʁak] ⓘ; 29 November 1932 – 26 September 2019) was a French politician who served as President of France from 1995 to 2007. He was previously Prime Minister of France from 1974 to 1976 and 1986 to 1988, as well as Mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995.
After attending the École nationale d'administration, Chirac began his career as a high-level civil servant, entering politics shortly thereafter. Chirac occupied various senior positions, including minister of agriculture and minister of the interior. In 1981 and 1988, he unsuccessfully ran for president as the standard-bearer for the conservative Gaullist party Rally for the Republic (RPR). Chirac's internal policies initially included lower tax rates, the removal of price controls, strong punishment for crime and terrorism, and business privatisation.[5]
After pursuing these policies in his second term as prime minister, Chirac changed his views. He argued for different economic policies and was elected president in 1995, with 52.6% of the vote in the second round, beating Socialist Lionel Jospin, after campaigning on a platform of healing the ""social rift"" (fracture sociale).[6] Chirac's economic policies, based on dirigisme, allowing for state-directed investment, stood in opposition to the laissez-faire policies of the United Kingdom under the ministries of Margaret Thatcher and John Major, which Chirac described as ""Anglo-Saxon ultraliberalism"".[7]

Chirac was known for his stand against the American-led invasion of Iraq, his recognition of the collaborationist French government's role in deporting Jews, and his reduction of the presidential term from seven years to five through a referendum in 2000. At the 2002 presidential election, he won 82.2% of the vote in the second round against the far-right candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and was the last president to be re-elected until 2022. In 2011, the Paris court declared Chirac guilty of diverting public funds and abusing public confidence, giving him a two-year suspended prison sentence.[8]Jacques René Chirac was born on 29 November 1932 in the 5th arrondissement of Paris.[9] He was the son of Abel François Marie Chirac (1898–1968), a successful executive for an aircraft company,[6] and Marie-Louise Valette (1902–1973), a housewife. His grandparents were all teachers[10] from Sainte-Féréole in Corrèze. His great-grandparents on both sides were peasants in the rural south-western region of the Corrèze.[11]
According to Chirac, his name ""originates from the langue d'oc, that of the troubadours, therefore that of poetry"".[12] He was a Catholic.[13]
Chirac was an only child (his elder sister, Jacqueline, died in infancy nearly ten years before his birth).[14] He was educated in Paris at the Cours Hattemer, a private school.[15] He then attended the Lycée Carnot and the Lycée Louis-le-Grand. After his baccalauréat, behind his father's back, he went off to serve for three months as a sailor on a coal transport.[16]
Chirac played rugby union for Brive's youth team, and also played at university level. He played no. 8 and second row.[17] At age 18, his ambition was to become a ship's captain.[18]
At age 16, Chirac wanted to learn Sanskrit and found a White Russian Sanskrit teacher in Paris who ended up teaching him Russian; by age 17 Chirac was almost fluent in Russian.[16] Inspired by Charles de Gaulle, Chirac started to pursue a civil service career in the 1950s. During this period, he joined the French Communist Party, sold copies of L'Humanité, and took part in meetings of a communist cell.[19] In 1950, he signed the Soviet-inspired Stockholm Appeal for the abolition of nuclear weapons – which led him to be questioned when he applied for his first visa to the United States.[20]
In 1953, after graduating from the Sciences Po, he attended a non-credit course at Harvard University's summer school, before entering the École nationale d'administration, which trains France's top civil servants, in 1957.[18]
In the United States, Chirac worked at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, Missouri.[21]
Chirac trained as a reserve military officer in armoured cavalry at Saumur.[22] He then volunteered to fight in the Algerian War, using personal connections to be sent despite the reservations of his superiors. His superiors did not want to make him an officer because they suspected he had communist leanings.[23] In 1965, he became an auditor in the Court of Auditors.[24]
In April 1962, Chirac was appointed head of the personal staff of Prime Minister Georges Pompidou. This appointment launched Chirac's political career. Pompidou considered Chirac his protégé, and referred to him as ""my bulldozer"" for his skill at getting things done. The nickname Le Bulldozer caught on in French political circles, where it also referred to his abrasive manner. As late as the 1988 presidential election, Chirac maintained this reputation.[25]
At Pompidou's suggestion, Chirac ran as a Gaullist for a seat in the National Assembly in 1967.[18] He was elected deputy for his home Corrèze département, a stronghold of the left. This surprising victory in the context of a Gaullist ebb permitted him to enter the government as Minister of Social Affairs. Although Chirac was well-situated in de Gaulle's entourage, being related by marriage to the general's sole companion at the time of the Appeal of 18 June 1940, he was more of a ""Pompidolian"" than a ""Gaullist"". When student and worker unrest rocked France in May 1968, Chirac played a central role in negotiating a truce.[18] Subsequently, as state secretary of economy (1968–1971), he worked closely with Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, who headed the ministry of economy and finance.[26]
After some months in the ministry for Relations with Parliament, Chirac's first high-level post came in 1972 when he became Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development under Pompidou, who had been elected president in 1969, after de Gaulle retired. Chirac quickly earned a reputation as a champion of French farmers' interests, and first attracted international attention when he assailed U.S., West German, and European Commission agricultural policies which conflicted with French interests.
On 27 February 1974, after the resignation of Raymond Marcellin, Chirac was appointed Minister of the Interior.[27] On 21 March 1974, he cancelled the SAFARI project due to privacy concerns after its existence was revealed by Le Monde.[28] From March 1974, he was entrusted by President Pompidou with preparations for the presidential election then scheduled for 1976. These elections were moved forward because of Pompidou's sudden death on 2 April 1974.
Chirac vainly attempted to rally Gaullists behind Prime Minister Pierre Messmer. Jacques Chaban-Delmas announced his candidacy in spite of the disapproval of the ""Pompidolians"". Chirac and others published the call of the 43 in favour of Giscard d'Estaing, the leader of the non-Gaullist part of the parliamentary majority. Giscard d'Estaing was elected as Pompidou's successor after France's most competitive election campaign in years. In return, the new president chose Chirac to lead the cabinet.
When Valéry Giscard d'Estaing became president, he nominated Chirac as prime minister on 27 May 1974, to reconcile the ""Giscardian"" and ""non-Giscardian"" factions of the parliamentary majority. At the age of 41, Chirac stood out as the very model of the jeunes loups ('young wolves') of French politics, but he was faced with the hostility of the ""Barons of Gaullism"" who considered him a traitor for his role during the previous presidential campaign. In December 1974, he took the lead of the Union of Democrats for the Republic (UDR) against the will of its more senior personalities.
As prime minister, Chirac quickly set about persuading the Gaullists that, despite the social reforms proposed by President Giscard, the basic tenets of Gaullism, such as national and European independence, would be retained. Chirac was advised by Pierre Juillet and Marie-France Garaud, two former advisers of Pompidou. These two organised the campaign against Chaban-Delmas in 1974. They advocated a clash with Giscard d'Estaing because they thought his policy bewildered the conservative electorate.[29]
Citing Giscard's unwillingness to give him authority, Chirac resigned as prime minister in 1976.[30] He proceeded to build up his political base among France's several conservative parties, with a goal of reconstituting the Gaullist UDR into a Neo-Gaullist group, the Rally for the Republic (RPR). Chirac's first tenure as prime minister was also an arguably progressive one, with improvements in both the minimum wage and the social welfare system carried out during the course of his premiership.[29]
After his departure from the cabinet, Chirac wanted to gain the leadership of the political right, to gain the French presidency in the future. The RPR was conceived as an electoral machine against President Giscard d'Estaing. Paradoxically, Chirac benefited from Giscard's decision to create the office of mayor in Paris, which had been in abeyance since the 1871 Commune, because the leaders of the Third Republic (1871–1940) feared that having municipal control of the capital would give the mayor too much power. In 1977, Chirac stood as a candidate against Michel d'Ornano, a close friend of the president, and won. As mayor of Paris, Chirac's political influence grew. He held this post until 1995.[31]
Chirac supporters point out that, as mayor, he provided programmes to help the elderly, people with disabilities, and single mothers, and introduced the street-cleaning Motocrotte,[32] while providing incentives for businesses to stay in Paris. His opponents contend that he installed ""clientelist"" policies.
In 1978, Chirac attacked Giscard's pro-European policy and made a nationalist turn with the December 1978 Call of Cochin, initiated by his counsellors Marie-France Garaud and Pierre Juillet [fr], which had first been called by Pompidou. Hospitalised in Hôpital Cochin after a car crash, he declared that ""as always about the drooping of France, the pro-foreign party acts with its peaceable and reassuring voice"". He appointed Yvan Blot, an intellectual who would later join the National Front, as director of his campaigns for the 1979 European election.[33]
After the poor results of the election, Chirac broke with Garaud and Juillet. Vexed Marie-France Garaud stated: ""We thought Chirac was made of the same marble of which statues are carved in, we perceive he's of the same faience bidets are made of.""[34] His rivalry with Giscard d'Estaing intensified.
Chirac made his first run for president against Giscard d'Estaing in the 1981 election, thus splitting the centre-right vote.[35] He was eliminated in the first round with 18% of the vote. He reluctantly supported Giscard in the second round. He refused to give instructions to the RPR voters but said that he supported the incumbent president ""in a private capacity"", which was interpreted as almost de facto support of the Socialist Party's (PS) candidate, François Mitterrand, who was elected by a broad majority.[36]
Giscard has always blamed Chirac for his defeat. He was told by Mitterrand, before his death, that the latter had dined with Chirac before the election. Chirac told the Socialist candidate that he wanted to ""get rid of Giscard"". In his memoirs, Giscard wrote that between the two rounds, he phoned the RPR headquarters. He passed himself off, as a right-wing voter, by changing his voice. The RPR employee advised him ""certainly do not vote Giscard!"" After 1981, the relationship between the two men became tense, with Giscard, even though he had been in the same government coalition as Chirac, criticising Chirac's actions openly.[citation needed]
After the May 1981 presidential election, the right also lost the subsequent legislative election that year. However, as Giscard had been knocked out, Chirac appeared as the principal leader of the right-wing opposition. Due to his attacks against the economic policy of the Socialist government, he gradually aligned himself with the prevailing economically liberal opinion, even though it did not correspond with Gaullist doctrine. While the far-right National Front grew, taking advantage of the proportional representation electoral system which had been introduced for the 1986 legislative elections, he signed an electoral pact with the Giscardian (and more or less Christian Democratic) party Union for French Democracy (UDF).[citation needed]
When the RPR/UDF right-wing coalition won a slight majority in the National Assembly in the 1986 election, Mitterrand (PS) appointed Chirac prime minister (though many in Mitterrand's inner circle lobbied him to choose Jacques Chaban-Delmas instead). This unprecedented power-sharing arrangement, known as cohabitation, gave Chirac the lead in domestic affairs. However, it is generally conceded that Mitterrand used the areas granted to the President of the Republic, or ""reserved domains"" of the Presidency, Defence and Foreign Affairs, to belittle his prime minister.[citation needed]
Chirac's cabinet sold many public companies, renewing the liberalisation initiated under Laurent Fabius's Socialist government of 1984–1986, and abolished the solidarity tax on wealth (ISF), a symbolic tax on those with high-value assets introduced by Mitterrand's government. Elsewhere, the plan for university reform (plan Devaquet) caused a crisis in 1986 when a student called Malik Oussekine was killed by the police, leading to massive demonstrations and the proposal's withdrawal. It has been said during other student crises that this event strongly affected Jacques Chirac, who was afterwards careful about possible police violence during such demonstrations (e.g., maybe explaining part of the decision to ""promulgate without applying"" the First Employment Contract (CPE) after large student demonstrations against it).[37]
One of his first acts concerning foreign policy was to call back Jacques Foccart (1913–1997), who had been de Gaulle's and his successors' leading counsellor for African matters, called by journalist Stephen Smith the ""father of all ""networks"" on the continent, at the time [in 1986] aged 72.""[38] Foccart, who had also co-founded the Gaullist SAC militia (dissolved by Mitterrand in 1982 after the Auriol massacre) along with Charles Pasqua, and who was a key component of the Françafrique system, was again called to the Elysée Palace when Chirac won the 1995 presidential election. Furthermore, confronted by anti-colonialist movements in New Caledonia, Prime Minister Chirac ordered a military intervention against the separatists in the Ouvéa cave, leading to the deaths of 19 militants. He allegedly refused any alliance with Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front.[39]
Chirac ran against Mitterrand for a second time in the 1988 election. He obtained 20 per cent of the vote in the first round but lost the second with only 46 per cent. He resigned from the cabinet and the right lost the next legislative election.[40]
For the first time, his leadership over the RPR was challenged. Charles Pasqua and Philippe Séguin criticised his abandonment of Gaullist doctrines. On the right, a new generation of politicians, the ""renovation men"", accused Chirac and Giscard of being responsible for the electoral defeats. In 1992, convinced a candidate could not become president whilst advocating anti-European policies, he called for a ""yes"" vote in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, against the opinion of Pasqua, Séguin and a majority of the RPR voters, who chose to vote ""no"".[41]
While he still was mayor of Paris (since 1977),[42] Chirac went to Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire) where he supported President Houphouët-Boigny (1960–1993), although the latter was being called a ""thief"" by the local population. Chirac then declared that multipartism was a ""kind of luxury"".[38]
Nevertheless, the right won the 1993 legislative election. Chirac announced that he did not want to come back as prime minister as his previous term had ended with his unsuccessful run for the presidency against Mitterrand who was still president at this point.
Chirac instead suggested the appointment of Edouard Balladur, who had promised that he would not run for the presidency against Chirac in 1995. However, benefiting from positive polls, Balladur decided to be a presidential candidate, with the support of a majority of right-wing politicians. Balladur broke from Chirac along with a number of friends and allies, including Charles Pasqua, Nicolas Sarkozy, etc., who supported his candidacy. A small group of fidels would remain with Chirac, including Alain Juppé and Jean-Louis Debré. When Nicolas Sarkozy became president in 2007, Juppé was one of the few chiraquiens to serve in François Fillon's government.[43]
During the 1995 presidential campaign, Chirac criticised the ""sole thought"" (pensée unique) of neoliberalism represented by his challenger on the right and promised to reduce the ""social fracture"", placing himself more to the centre and thus forcing Balladur to radicalise himself. Ultimately, he obtained more votes than Balladur in the first round (20.8 per cent), and then defeated the Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin in the second round (52.6 per cent).[44]
Chirac was elected on a platform of tax cuts and job programmes, but his policies did little to ease the labour strikes during his first months in office. On the domestic front, neo-liberal economic austerity measures introduced by Chirac and his conservative prime minister Alain Juppé, including budgetary cutbacks, proved highly unpopular. At about the same time, it became apparent that Juppé and others had obtained preferential conditions for public housing, as well as other perks. At the year's end, Chirac faced major workers' strikes which turned, in November–December 1995, into a general strike, one of the largest since May 1968. The demonstrations were largely pitted against Juppé's plan for pension reform, and ultimately led to his dismissal.
Shortly after taking office, Chirac – undaunted by international protests by environmental groups – insisted upon the resumption of nuclear tests at Mururoa Atoll in French Polynesia in 1995, a few months before signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.[45] Reacting to criticism, Chirac said, ""You only have to look back at 1935...There were people then who were against France arming itself, and look what happened."" On 1 February 1996, Chirac announced that France had ended ""once and for all"" its nuclear testing and intended to accede to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
Elected as President of the Republic, he refused to discuss the existence of French military bases in Africa, despite requests by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.[38] The French Army thus remained in Côte d'Ivoire as well as in Omar Bongo's Gabon.
Prior to 1995, the French government had maintained that the French Republic had been dismantled when Philippe Pétain instituted a new French State during World War II and that the Republic had been re-established when the war was over. It was not for France, therefore, to apologise for the roundup of Jews for deportation that happened while the Republic had not existed and was carried out by a state, Vichy France, which it did not recognise. President François Mitterrand had reiterated this position: ""The Republic had nothing to do with this. I do not believe France is responsible,"" he said in September 1994.[46]
Chirac was the first president of France to take responsibility for the deportation of Jews during the Vichy regime. In a speech made on 16 July 1995 at the site of the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, where 13,000 Jews had been held for deportation to concentration camps in July 1942, Chirac said, ""France, on that day, committed the irreparable"". Those responsible for the roundup were ""4,500 policemen and gendarmes, French, under the authority of their leaders [who] obeyed the demands of the Nazis. ... the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French State"".[47][48][49]
In 1997, Chirac dissolved parliament for early legislative elections in a gamble designed to bolster support for his conservative economic program. But instead, it created an uproar, and his power was weakened by the subsequent backlash. The Socialist Party (PS), joined by other parties on the left, soundly defeated Chirac's conservative allies, forcing Chirac into a new period of cohabitation with Jospin as prime minister (1997–2002), which lasted five years.
Cohabitation significantly weakened the power of Chirac's presidency. The French president, by a constitutional convention, only controls foreign and military policy— and even then, allocation of funding is under the control of Parliament and under the significant influence of the prime minister. Short of dissolving parliament and calling for new elections, the president was left with little power to influence public policy regarding crime, the economy, and public services. Chirac seized the occasion to periodically criticise Jospin's government.
His position was weakened by scandals about the financing of RPR by Paris municipality. In 2001, the left, represented by Bertrand Delanoë (PS), won a majority on the city council of the capital. Jean Tiberi, Chirac's successor at the Paris city hall, was forced to resign after having been put under investigation in June 1999 on charges of trafic d'influences in the HLMs of Paris affairs (related to the illegal financing of the RPR). Tiberi was finally expelled from the Rally for the Republic, Chirac's party, on 12 October 2000, declaring to the magazine Le Figaro on 18 November 2000: ""Jacques Chirac is not my friend anymore"".[50]
After the publication of the diaries of Jean-Claude Méry by Le Monde on 22 September 2000, in which Jean-Claude Méry, in charge of the RPR's financing, directly accused Chirac of organising the network, and of having been physically present on 5 October 1986, when Méry gave in cash 5 million Francs, which came from companies who had benefited from state deals, to Michel Roussin, personal secretary (directeur de cabinet) of Chirac,[51][52] Chirac refused to attend court in response to his summons by judge Eric Halphen, and the highest echelons of the French justice system declared that he could not be inculpated while in office.
During his two terms, he increased the Elysee Palace's total budget by 105 per cent (to €90 million, whereas 20 years before it was the equivalent of €43.7 million). He doubled the number of presidential cars – to 61 cars and seven scooters in the Palace's garage. He hired 145 extra employees – the total number of people he employed simultaneously was 963.
As the Supreme Commander of the French armed forces, he reduced the military budget, as did his predecessor. At the end of his first term, it accounted for three per cent of GDP.[53] In 1997 the aircraft carrier Clemenceau was decommissioned after 37 years of service, with her sister ship Foch decommissioned in 2000 after 37 years of service, leaving the French Navy with no aircraft carrier until 2001, when Charles de Gaulle was commissioned.[54] He also reduced expenditure on nuclear weapons[citation needed] and the French nuclear arsenal was reduced to include 350 warheads, compared to the Russian nuclear arsenal of 16,000 warheads.[citation needed] He also published a plan to reduce the number of fighters the French military had by 30.[55]
After François Mitterrand left office in 1995, Chirac began a rapprochement with NATO by joining the Military Committee and attempting to negotiate a return to the integrated military command, which failed after the French demand for parity with the United States went unmet. The possibility of a further attempt foundered after Chirac was forced into cohabitation with a Socialist-led cabinet between 1997 and 2002, then poor Franco-American relations after the French UN veto threat over Iraq in 2003 made transatlantic negotiations impossible.
On 25 July 2000, as Chirac and the first lady were returning from the G7 Summit in Okinawa, Japan, they were placed in a dangerous situation by Air France Flight 4590 after they landed at Charles de Gaulle International Airport. The first couple were in an Air France Boeing 747 taxiing toward the terminal when the jet had to stop and wait for Flight 4590 to take off.[56] The departing plane, an Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde, ran over a strip of metal on takeoff puncturing its left fuel tank and sliced electrical wires near the left landing gear. The sequence of events ignited a large fire and caused the Concorde to veer left on its takeoff roll. As it reached takeoff speed and lifted off the ground, it came within 30 feet of hitting Chirac's 747. Photographs of Flight 4590 ablaze were taken by passenger Toshihiko Sato on Chirac's jetliner.
At the age of 69, Chirac faced his fourth presidential campaign in 2002. He received 20% of the vote in the first ballot of the presidential elections in April 2002. It had been expected that he would face incumbent prime minister Lionel Jospin (PS) in the second round of elections; instead, Chirac faced far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen of the National Front (FN), who came in 200,000 votes ahead of Jospin. All parties other than the National Front (except for Lutte ouvrière) called for opposing Le Pen, even if it meant voting for Chirac. The 14-day period between the two rounds of voting was marked by demonstrations against Le Pen and slogans such as ""Vote for the crook, not for the fascist"" or ""Vote with a clothespin on your nose"". Chirac won re-election by a landslide, with 82 per cent of the vote on the second ballot. However, Chirac became increasingly unpopular during his second term. According to a July 2005 poll,[57] 37 per cent judged Chirac favourably and 63 per cent unfavourably. In 2006, The Economist wrote that Chirac ""is the most unpopular occupant of the Elysée Palace in the fifth republic's history.""[58]
As the left-wing Socialist Party was in thorough disarray following Jospin's defeat, Chirac reorganised politics on the right, establishing a new party – initially called the Union of the Presidential Majority, then the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). The RPR had broken down; a number of members had formed Eurosceptic breakaways. While the Giscardian liberals of the Union for French Democracy (UDF) had moved to the right,[citation needed] the UMP won the parliamentary elections that followed the presidential poll with ease.
During an official visit to Madagascar on 21 July 2005, Chirac described the repression of the 1947 Malagasy uprising, which left between 80,000 and 90,000 dead, as ""unacceptable"".
Despite past opposition to state intervention, the Chirac government approved a €2.8 billion aid package to troubled manufacturing giant Alstom.[59] In October 2004, Chirac signed a trade agreement with PRC president Hu Jintao where Alstom was given €1 billion in contracts and promises of future investment in China.[60]
On 14 July 2002, during Bastille Day celebrations, Chirac survived an assassination attempt by a lone gunman with a rifle hidden in a guitar case. The would-be assassin fired a shot toward the presidential motorcade, before being overpowered by bystanders.[61] The gunman, Maxime Brunerie, underwent psychiatric testing; the violent far-right group with which he was associated, Unité Radicale, was thence administratively dissolved.
Along with Vladimir Putin (whom he called ""a personal friend""),[62] Hu Jintao, and Gerhard Schröder, Chirac emerged as a leading voice against George W. Bush and Tony Blair in 2003 during the organisation and deployment of American and British forces participating in a military coalition to forcibly remove the government of Iraq controlled by the Ba'ath Party under the leadership of Saddam Hussein that resulted in the 2003–2011 Iraq War.
Despite British and American pressure, Chirac threatened to veto, at that given point, a resolution in the UN Security Council that would authorise the use of military force to rid Iraq of alleged weapons of mass destruction, and rallied other governments to his position. ""Iraq today does not represent an immediate threat that justifies an immediate war"", Chirac said on 18 March 2003. Future prime minister Dominique de Villepin acquired much of his popularity for his speech against the war at the United Nations (UN).[63]
After Togo's leader Gnassingbé Eyadéma's death on 5 February 2005, Chirac gave him tribute and supported his son, Faure Gnassingbé, who has since succeeded his father.[38]
On 19 January 2006, Chirac said that France was prepared to launch a nuclear strike against any country that sponsors a terrorist attack against French interests. He said his country's nuclear arsenal had been reconfigured to include the ability to make a tactical strike in retaliation for terrorism.[64]
Chirac criticised the Israeli offensive into Lebanon on 14 July 2006.[65] However, Israeli Army Radio later reported that Chirac had secretly told Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert that France would support an Israeli invasion of Syria and the overthrow of the government of President Bashar al-Assad, promising to veto any moves against Israel in the United Nations or European Union.[66] Whereas the disagreement on Iraq had caused a rift between Paris and Washington, recent analysis suggests that both governments worked closely together on the Syria file to end the Syrian occupation of Lebanon, and that Chirac was a driver of this diplomatic cooperation.[67]
In July 2006, the G8 met to discuss international energy concerns. Despite the rising awareness of global warming issues, the G8 focused on ""energy security"" issues. Chirac continued[when?] to be the voice[citation needed] within the G8 summit meetings to support international action to curb global warming and climate change concerns. Chirac warned that ""humanity is dancing on a volcano"" and called for serious action by the world's leading industrialised nations.[citation needed]
After Chirac's death in 2019, the street leading to the Louvre Abu Dhabi was named Jacques Chirac Street in November 2019 in celebration of Chirac's efforts to bolster links between France and the United Arab Emirates during his presidency.[68]
Chirac espoused a staunchly pro-Moroccan policy, and the already established pro-Moroccan French stances vis-à-vis the Western Sahara conflict were strengthened during his presidential tenure.[69]
Chirac requested the Landau-report (published in September 2004) and combined with the Report of the Technical Group on Innovative Financing Mechanisms formulated upon request by the Heads of State of Brazil, Chile, France and Spain (issued in December 2004), these documents present various opportunities for innovative financing mechanisms while equally stressing the advantages (stability and predictability) of tax-based models. The UNITAID project was born. Today the organisation's executive board is chaired by Marisol Touraine.[70]
On 29 May 2005, a referendum was held in France to decide whether the country should ratify the proposed treaty for a Constitution of the European Union (TCE). The result was a victory for the No campaign, with 55 per cent of voters rejecting the treaty on a turnout of 69 per cent, dealing a devastating blow to Chirac and the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party, and to part of the centre-left which had supported the TCE. Following the referendum defeat, Chirac replaced his prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin with Dominique de Villepin. In an address to the nation, Chirac declared that the new cabinet's top priority was to curb unemployment, which was consistently hovering above 10 per cent, calling for a ""national mobilisation"" to that effect.[71]
Following major student protests in spring 2006, which followed civil unrest in autumn 2005 after the death of two young boys in Clichy-sous-Bois, one of the poorest communes in Paris' suburbs, Chirac retracted the proposed First Employment Contract (CPE) by ""promulgating [it] without applying it"", an unheard-of – and, some claim, illegal – move intended to appease the protesters while giving the appearance of not making a volte-face regarding the contract, and therefore to continue his support for his prime minister Dominique de Villepin.[citation needed]
In early September 2005, Chirac suffered an event that his doctors described as a ""vascular incident"". It was officially reported as a ""minor stroke""[72] or a mild stroke (also known as a transient ischemic attack).[73] He recovered and returned to his duties soon afterward.
In a pre-recorded television broadcast aired on 11 March 2007, he announced, in a widely predicted move, that he would not choose to seek a third term as president. (In 2000 the constitution was amended to reduce the length of the presidential term to five years, so his second term was shorter than his first.)[74] ""My whole life has been committed to serving France, and serving peace"", Chirac said, adding that he would find new ways to serve France after leaving office. He did not explain the reasons for his decision.[75] He did not, during the broadcast, endorse any of the candidates running for election, but did devote several minutes of his talk to a plea against extremist politics that was considered a thinly disguised invocation to voters not to vote for Jean-Marie Le Pen and a recommendation to Nicolas Sarkozy not to orient his campaign so as to include themes traditionally associated with Le Pen.[76]
Shortly after leaving office, he launched the Fondation Chirac[77] in June 2008. Since then it has been striving for peace through five advocacy programmes: conflict prevention, access to water and sanitation, access to quality medicines and healthcare, access to land resources, and preservation of cultural diversity. It supports field projects that involve local people and provide concrete and innovative solutions. Chirac chaired the jury for the Prize for Conflict Prevention awarded every year by his foundation.[78] As a former president of France, he was entitled to a lifetime pension and personal security protection, and was an ex officio member for life of the Constitutional Council.[79] He sat for the first time on the council on 15 November 2007, six months after leaving the presidency. Immediately after Sarkozy's victory, Chirac moved into a 180-square-metre (1,900 sq ft) duplex on the Quai Voltaire in Paris lent to him by the family of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri. During the Didier Schuller affair, the latter accused Hariri of having participated in illegal funding of the RPR's political campaigns, but the judge closed the case without further investigations.[80] In Volume 2 of his memoirs published in June 2011, Chirac mocked his successor Nicolas Sarkozy as ""irritable, rash, impetuous, disloyal, ungrateful, and un-French"".[81][82] Chirac wrote that he considered firing Sarkozy previously, and conceded responsibility in allowing Jean-Marie Le Pen to advance in 2002.[83] A poll conducted in 2010 suggested Chirac was the most admired political figure in France, while Sarkozy was 32nd.[81] On 11 April 2008, Chirac's office announced that he had undergone successful surgery to fit a pacemaker.[84]
Chirac suffered from frail health and memory loss in later life. In February 2014 he was admitted to hospital because of pains related to gout.[85][86] On 10 December 2015, Chirac was hospitalised in Paris for undisclosed reasons, although his state of health did not ""give any cause for concern"", he remained for about a week in ICU.[87] According to his son-in-law Frederic Salat-Baroux, Chirac was again hospitalised in Paris with a lung infection on 18 September 2016.[88]
Chirac died at his home in the 6th arrondissement of Paris on 26 September 2019, surrounded by his family.[89] A requiem mass was held at Saint-Sulpice on 30 September, celebrated by Michel Aupetit, Archbishop of Paris, and attended by representatives from about 175 countries, included 69 past and present heads of state, government and international organisations. Notable names included António Guterres, Jean-Claude Juncker, Jens Stoltenberg, Vladimir Putin, Sergio Mattarella, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Charles Michel, Viktor Orbán, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Saad Hariri, Borut Pahor, Salome Zourabichvili, Prince Edward, Jean Chrétien, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, Bill Clinton, Hamid Karzai, Dai Bingguo  plus many ministers.[citation needed]
The day was declared a national day of mourning in France and a minute of silence was held nationwide at 15:00. Following the public ceremony, Chirac was buried at Montparnasse Cemetery, with only close family in attendance. Andorra announced three days of national mourning.[90] Lebanon declared the day of the ex-president's funeral national day of mourning.[91][92]
Chirac was a major supporter of the nation's film industry.[93]
Because of Jacques Chirac's long public career, he was often parodied or caricatured: Young Jacques Chirac is the basis of a young, dashing bureaucrat character in the 1976 Asterix comic strip album Obelix and Co., proposing methods to quell Gallic unrest to elderly, old-style Roman politicians. Chirac was also featured in Le Bêbête Show as an overexcited, jumpy character.
Jacques Chirac was a favourite character of Les Guignols de l'Info, a satiric latex puppet show.[94] He was originally portrayed as a rather likeable, though overexcited, character; following the corruption allegations, however, he was depicted as a kind of dilettante and incompetent who pilfered public money and lied through his teeth. His character for a while developed a superhero alter ego, Super Menteur ('super liar') to get him out of embarrassing situations.
In 1988, the band Parabellum lambasted Chirac in their song Anarchie en Chiraquie (""anarchy in Chirac-land""). In 1995, Zebda criticized Chirac's declarations on the ""noise and smell"" of immigrant families.[95]
Because of his alleged improprieties, Chirac was lambasted in a song Chirac en prison ('Chirac in prison') by French punk band Les Wampas, with a video clip made by the Guignols.[96] Similarly, the band Sinsemilia lambasted Chirac in the song Bienvenue en Chiraquie (""Welcome to Chirac-land"") as being the leader of a political mafia behaving outside of the laws applicable to normal citizenry. In June 2005, the band attracted media controversy when, on live television during midday news, it stopped early playing the gentle Tout le bonheur du monde and instead started playing Bienvenue en Chiraquie as a political gesture, before being cut early.[97]
He was given the Ig Nobel prize for peace, for commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Hiroshima with atomic bomb tests in the Pacific (1996).
J. Grant Albrecht voices Chirac in the Oliver Stone film W. Marc Rioufol plays him in Richard Loncraine's 2010 film The Special Relationship.[98]
Bernard Le Coq portrays Chirac in La Dernière Campagne and The Conquest by Xavier Durringer.[99][100]
At the invitation of Saddam Hussein (then vice-president of Iraq, but de facto dictator), Chirac made an official visit to Baghdad in 1975. Hussein approved a deal granting French oil companies a number of privileges plus a 23-percent share of Iraqi oil.[101] As part of this deal, France sold Iraq the Osirak MTR nuclear reactor, designed to test nuclear materials.
The Israeli Air Force alleged that the reactor's imminent commissioning was a threat to its security, and pre-emptively bombed the Osirak reactor on 7 June 1981, provoking considerable anger from French officials and the United Nations Security Council.[102]
The Osirak deal became a controversy again in 2002–2003, when an international military coalition led by the United States invaded Iraq and forcibly removed Hussein's government from power. France led several other European countries in an effort to prevent the invasion. The Osirak deal was then used by parts of the American media to criticise the Chirac-led opposition to starting a war in Iraq,[103] despite French involvement in the Gulf War.[104]
Chirac has been named in several cases of alleged corruption that occurred during his term as mayor, some of which have led to felony convictions of some politicians and aides. However, a controversial judicial decision in 1999 granted Chirac immunity while he was president of France. He refused to testify on these matters, arguing that it would be incompatible with his presidential functions. Investigations concerning the running of Paris's city hall, the number of whose municipal employees increased by 25% from 1977 to 1995 (with 2,000 out of approximately 35,000 coming from the Corrèze region where Chirac had held his seat as deputy), as well as a lack of financial transparency (marchés publics) and the communal debt, were thwarted by the legal impossibility of questioning him as president.[105]
The conditions of the privatisation of the Parisian water system acquired very cheaply by the Compagnie Générale des Eaux and the Lyonnaise des Eaux, then directed by Jérôme Monod, a close friend of Chirac, were also criticised. Furthermore, the satirical newspaper Le Canard enchaîné revealed the astronomical ""food expenses"" paid by the Parisian municipality (€15 million a year according to the Canard), expenses managed by Roger Romani (who allegedly destroyed all archives of the period 1978–93 during night raids in 1999–2000). Thousands of people were invited each year to receptions in the Paris city hall, while many political, media and artistic personalities were hosted in private flats owned by the city.[105]
Chirac's immunity from prosecution ended in May 2007, when he left office as president. In November 2007 a preliminary charge of misuse of public funds was filed against him.[106] Chirac is said to be the first former French head of state to be formally placed under investigation for a crime.[107] On 30 October 2009, a judge ordered Chirac to stand trial on embezzlement charges, dating back to his time as mayor of Paris.[108]
On 7 March 2011, he went on trial on charges of diverting public funds, accused of giving fictional city jobs to 28 activists from his political party while serving as the mayor of Paris (1977–95).[109][110] Along with Chirac, nine others stood trial in two separate cases, one dealing with fictional jobs for 21 people and the other with jobs for the remaining seven.[109] The President of Union for a Popular Movement, who later served as France's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, was sentenced to a 14-month suspended prison sentence for the same case in 2004.[111]
On 15 December 2011, Chirac was found guilty and given a suspended sentence of two years.[111] He was convicted of diverting public funds, abuse of trust and illegal conflict of interest. The suspended sentence meant he did not have to go to prison and took into account his age, health and status as a former head of state.[112] He did not attend the trial, since medical doctors deemed that his neurological problems damaged his memory.[111] His defence team decided not to appeal.[111][113]
During April and May 2006, Chirac's administration was beset by a crisis as his chosen prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, was accused of asking Philippe Rondot, a top-level French spy, for a secret investigation into Villepin's chief political rival, Nicolas Sarkozy, in 2004. This matter has been called the second Clearstream Affair. On 10 May 2006, following a Cabinet meeting, Chirac made a rare television appearance to try to protect Villepin from the scandal and to debunk allegations that Chirac himself had set up a Japanese bank account containing 300 million francs in 1992 as Mayor of Paris.[114] Chirac said that ""The Republic is not a dictatorship of rumours, a dictatorship of calumny.""[115]
In 1956, Chirac married Bernadette Chodron de Courcel, with whom he had two daughters: Laurence (4 March 1958 – 14 April 2016)[116] and Claude (born 6 December 1962). Claude was a long-term public relations assistant and personal adviser to her father,[117] while Laurence, who suffered from anorexia nervosa in her youth, did not participate in her father's political activities.[118] Chirac was the grandfather of Martin Rey-Chirac by the relationship of Claude with French judoka Thierry Rey.[119] A former Vietnamese refugee, Anh Dao Traxel, is a foster daughter of Jacques and Bernadette Chirac.[120]
Chirac remained married, but had many other relationships.[121][122][123]
Chirac was a close friend of actor Gregory Peck.[citation needed]
In 1954, Chirac presented The Development of the Port of New-Orleans, a short geography/economic thesis to the Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po—), which he had entered three years before. The 182-page typewritten work, supervised by Professor Jean Chardonnet, is illustrated by photographs, sketches and diagrams.
(27 May 1974 – 25 August 1976)
(20 March 1986 – 12 May 1988)
On 22 July 2003, Jacques Chirac was presented with the inaugural Kuala Lumpur World Peace Award by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad at his office.[137]

The marble Cupid and Psyche conserved in the Capitoline Museums,[1] Rome, is a 1st or 2nd century Roman copy of a late Hellenistic period original.[2] It was given to the nascent Capitoline Museums by Pope Benedict XIV in 1749, shortly after its discovery. Its graceful balance and sentimental appearance made it a favourite among the neoclassical generations of artists and visitors, and it was copied in many materials from bronze to biscuit porcelain.[3] Antonio Canova consciously set out to outdo the Antique original with his own Cupid and Psyche of 1808 (illustration, below left)
The sculpture was discovered in the garden of the vigna of the canonico Panicale on the Aventine Hill in February 1749.[4]
The sculpture quite eclipsed a Roman marble of a winged Cupid and Psyche that had been discovered in the 17th century and removed to the Medici collection in Florence. The Capitoline Cupid and Psyche was among the cream of the Roman collections sequestered by the French under the terms of the treaty of Tolentino (1797) and transferred to Paris amid grand theatrics. It was returned to Rome after the fall of Napoleon.
Not all viewers were satisfied by its mediocre execution, and Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny noted that Jean-Baptiste de Saint-Victor[5] thought it was a reflection of some earlier, better work, and that, earlier, Joseph-Jerome Le Français de Lalande hoped in print[6] that it might inspire some modern sculptor to come up with a superior work on the same subject. Antonio Canova took up the challenge quite consciously, in his Cupid and Psyche of 1808.
Another version of the Cupid and Psyche was discovered by conte Giuseppe Fede in his early excavations at Hadrian's Villa, Tivoli. It has disappeared now, but it was drawn, in its completed and restored condition, by Pompeo Batoni, who was assembling a ""paper museum""[7] of antiquities in 1727–30 for the English antiquary Richard Topham.[8] As it was restored, Cupid turns his head away coyly.

Dennis Dale McLain (born March 29, 1944) is an American former professional baseball player.[1] He played for ten seasons in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher, most prominently as a member of the Detroit Tigers. In 1968, McLain became the last Major League Baseball pitcher to win 30 or more games during a season (with a record of 31–6) — a feat accomplished by only 11 players in the 20th century, with the most recent 34 years earlier.[2][3]
As a player, McLain was known for his outspoken nature, which occasionally led to conflicts with teammates and fans. His early major league career included notable achievements such as two Cy Young awards and an American League MVP award. While achieving success in baseball, McLain faced legal issues in his personal life, including convictions related to organized crime and embezzlement, for which he served time in prison.[4][5]
McLain was born in Markham, Illinois, and attended Mt. Carmel High School in Chicago, where he played on the baseball team as a shortstop and pitcher.[4] As a teenager, he met his future wife, Sharyn Boudreau, the daughter of major league player Lou Boudreau.[5] McLain was also musically talented, learning to play the organ from Bob Creed, the Chicago White Sox organist.[4]
Upon his graduation from high school in June 1962, McLain was signed by the Chicago White Sox as an amateur free agent, and was assigned to play with the Harlan Smokies of the Appalachian League.[6] McLain's minor league debut was notable for throwing a no-hitter and striking out 16 batters in a game against the Salem Rebels on June 28.[4] After just two games with the Smokies, he was promoted to the Clinton C-Sox of the Midwest League, where he posted a record of four wins and seven losses.[6]
At the time, players with one year of service in the minor leagues were subject to a draft if they were not called up to the major leagues.[4] The White Sox left McLain in the minor leagues, and he was selected on waivers by the Detroit Tigers on April 8, 1963.[1] He progressed swiftly through the Tigers' minor league system, jumping from Class A Duluth-Superior to Class AA Knoxville during the summer. The Tigers saw enough promise that they decided to advance him all the way from Class AA to the majors, and he made his major league debut on September 21, 1963 at the age of 19.[1] His debut against the Chicago White Sox was notable, as he allowed one earned run on seven hits.  He also picked off two baserunners and hit a home run, which was the only home run of his major-league career. McLain is one of only six teenage pitchers to hit a major-league home run since 1920, a list that includes Hall-of-Famers Don Drysdale and Jim Palmer.[4]
McLain began the 1964 season with the Syracuse Chiefs of the International League, but was called back to the major leagues in early June and ended the season with a won-loss record of 4–5.[1] He then played for the Mayagüez Indians in the Puerto Rico Baseball League, where he posted a 13–2 record and helped the Indians win the league championship.[4] He was called back to the majors in 1965 and continued to pitch well for the Tigers. On June 15, McLain set a major-league record for relief pitchers, when he struck out the first seven batters he faced after entering the game in the first inning to relieve starting pitcher Dave Wickersham.[7] He ended the season with a 16–6 record, a 2.61 earned run average, and 192 strikeouts, the third-highest strikeout total in the American League behind Sam McDowell and teammate Mickey Lolich.[1][8] Although he had a curveball and a changeup, he relied mostly on his fastball to get batters out.[4]
In 1966, McLain had a 13–4 mid-season record and earned the role of American League starting pitcher in the 1966 All-Star Game, where he threw just 28 pitches to retire all nine batters that he faced.[9][10] He finished the season with a 20–14 record with a 3.92 earned run average.[1]
In 1967, the Tigers hired former major-league pitcher Johnny Sain as their pitching coach.[11] Sain helped develop McLain's pitching skills and taught him the psychology of pitching.[11][12] The 1967 season was memorable due to the tight four-way pennant race between the Tigers, the Boston Red Sox, the Minnesota Twins, and the Chicago White Sox.[4] McLain finished with a 17–16 record and a 3.79 earned run average but was winless after August 29.[1][13] On September 18, McLain reported that he had severely injured two toes on his left foot, saying that he had stubbed them after his foot had fallen asleep.[4] Going into the final game of the season against the California Angels, the Tigers needed a victory to force a one-game playoff with the Red Sox for the American League pennant.[4] McLain pitched ineffectively in the final game and the Tigers lost to finish the season one game behind the Red Sox.[14]
Ten games into the 1968 season, the Tigers were in first place, having won nine consecutive games after losing the opener. McLain made controversial statements in early May by criticizing Detroit fans for being ""the biggest front-running fans in the world.""[15][16] He continued to win games at a remarkable pace, registering his 29th victory on September 10.[17] On September 13, he appeared on the cover of Time.[18][19] On September 14 at Tiger Stadium, McLain pitched the Tigers to a 5–4 victory over the Oakland Athletics in front of a nationally televised audience to become Major League Baseball's first 30-game winner since 1934.[20] Dizzy Dean, the previous 30-game winner, was on hand to congratulate him.[20]
After the Tigers had clinched the 1968 American League pennant, McLain attracted attention during his 31st and final regular season victory in a game against the Yankees on September 19.[4] McLain had grown up idolizing New York Yankee center fielder Mickey Mantle, who entered the game tied with Jimmie Foxx for third place in the major-league career home runs list.[21] When Mantle—who was nine days away from his last major league appearance—came to bat in the eighth inning with the Tigers leading 6–1, McLain intentionally threw a soft pitch directly over home plate.[21] Other accounts said that he called catcher Jim Price to the mound and had him tell Mantle that he would be throwing only fastballs.[22] Mantle hit the pitch for his 535th career home run (the penultimate home run Mantle would hit in his career), putting him in sole possession of third place on the all-time home run list, behind only Babe Ruth and Willie Mays. After Mantle's home run, McLain remained on the pitcher's mound and acknowledged the moment, while Mantle acknowledged McLain as he rounded the bases.[5][22] The next batter, Joe Pepitone, waved his bat over the plate, as if asking for an easy pitch of his own. McLain responded by throwing the next pitch over Pepitone's head.[23] After the game, McLain smilingly denied that he had served up an easy pitch for Mantle to hit; however, he was later reprimanded by Major League Baseball Commissioner William Eckert.[4][21]
McLain completed a 31–6 record along with a 1.96 earned run average, as the Tigers won the American League pennant by 12 games. He had 280 strikeouts and 63 walks, giving him a 4.44 K:BB ratio, a Tigers season record that stood until 2016, when it was eclipsed by Justin Verlander.[1][24] McLain also earned his second All-Star berth and won the 1968 American League Cy Young Award, as well as the American League Most Valuable Player Award, the first by an American League pitcher since Bobby Shantz in 1952 and the first by a Tiger since fellow pitcher Hal Newhouser's back-to-back honors in 1944 and 1945.[25][26][27] He was the first pitcher in American League history to win the Most Valuable Player Award and the Cy Young Award in the same season.[28] St. Louis Cardinal Bob Gibson won the National League's Most Valuable Player Award that same year, making 1968 the only season to date in which a pitcher won the MVP Award in both leagues (it was also the only time both Cy Young Award winners were voted unanimously until 2022).
McLain's performance in the Tigers' 1968 World Series triumph over the Cardinals was not as impressive as his regular season.[opinion][29] Having already pitched 336 innings and 28 complete games during the regular season, a sore-armed McLain lost twice to Gibson (including a still-standing World Series record 17-strikeout performance in the opener) to help put the Tigers down three games to one. Trailing three games to two, McLain won the crucial Game 6 on just two days' rest, aided by a grand slam home run from Jim Northrup.[30] Teammate Mickey Lolich won three games during the series, including a complete-game triumph (also on two days’ rest) in Game 7 against Gibson, and won the World Series MVP award.[31] After the season, when McLain was asked about Lolich's performance in the World Series, he responded controversially by saying: ""I wouldn't trade one Bob Gibson for 12 Mickey Loliches.""[4]
The season became known as the ""Year of the Pitcher"", with batting averages and run production dropping in both leagues.[12] After the record home-run year by Roger Maris in 1961, the major leagues increased the size of the strike zone from the top of the batter's shoulders to the bottom of the knees.[32] Pitchers such as McLain and Gibson among others dominated hitters, producing 339 shutouts in 1968.[12] Carl Yastrzemski was the only American League hitter to finish the season with a batting average higher than .300.  In the National League, Gibson posted a 1.12 earned run average, the lowest in 54 years, while Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale threw a record 58+2⁄3 consecutive scoreless innings during the 1968 season.[12] As a result of the dropping offensive statistics, Major League Baseball took steps to reduce the advantage held by pitchers by lowering the height of the pitcher's mound from 15 inches to 10, and by reducing the size of the strike zone for the 1969 season.[33] Since then, no pitcher has won more than 27 games in a season.
In January 1969, McLain was selected as the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year.[34] He created more disruption when he was named as the starting pitcher for the American League in the 1969 All-Star Game in Washington, D.C., but missed the start of the game because of a dental appointment in Detroit. The appointment was scheduled for Wednesday the 23rd, the day after the All-Star game, but because of a rainout on the scheduled date, the game was played on the 23rd.[35]
McLain often deviated from conventional expectations, demonstrating an independent approach.[4] He had learned to fly and purchased an airplane.[4] Having kept his dental appointment, he then flew himself to Washington, arriving at the game during the second inning.[35] He pitched in the fourth inning, but by then the National League had already built a 9–2 lead.[36]
McLain had disagreements with Tigers' manager Mayo Smith, including disputes over the firing of pitching coach Johnny Sain.[2] Despite the troubles, McLain had another productive season in 1969, winning 24 games and a second consecutive Cy Young Award, tying with Baltimore's Mike Cuellar, marking the first time two players had shared the award.[1][37] It was the last award of his major league career.[1]
In February 1970, Sports Illustrated and Penthouse both published articles about McLain's involvement in bookmaking activities. Sports Illustrated cited sources who alleged that the foot injury suffered by McLain late in 1967 was caused by an organized crime figure who stomped on McLain's foot as punishment for failing to pay off on a lost bet. Early in his career, McLain's interest in betting on horses was piqued by Chuck Dressen, one of his first managers.[2] McLain's involvement in gambling reportedly began following a discussion about shared interests with a Pepsi representative. (When he pitched, he was known to drink a Pepsi between innings.) A representative from Pepsi then offered McLain a contract with the company, just for doing a few endorsements. McLain soon realized that he and the Pepsi representative shared an affinity for gambling; when the two realized how much money they were losing, and that they could earn so much more by ""taking the action"" on bets, they attempted to set up a bookmaking operation as hands-off, silent partners.
McLain was suspended indefinitely by Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn; the suspension was then set for the first three months of the 1970 season.[38] He returned in mid-season, but struggled to pitch well.[4] In September, the Tigers suspended him for seven days after he doused sportswriters Jim Hawkins of the Detroit Free Press and Watson Spoelstra of The Detroit News with buckets of water. Just as the seven-day suspension was about to end, he was suspended for at least the remainder of the season by Kuhn for carrying a gun on a team flight.[4] McLain's 1970 season ended with a won-loss record of only 3–5.[1] Later that year, he was forced into bankruptcy despite being the first $100,000 player in Tigers history.[4] Meanwhile, McLain and his teammate Jim Northrup schemed together to make more money; they were back in Detroit furthering a plan that they shared to generate a nude baseball model calendar. These efforts eventually fell short.[citation needed]
On October 9, 1970, the Tigers traded McLain, Elliott Maddox, Norm McRae, and Don Wert to the Washington Senators for Joe Coleman, Eddie Brinkman, Jim Hannan, and Aurelio Rodríguez.[39] Kuhn actually had to clear the trade because McLain was still under suspension, and suspended players cannot be traded without the commissioner's permission. Kuhn later wrote in his autobiography, Hardball: The Education of a Baseball Commissioner, that he was shocked at what he called a ""foolish gamble"" by the Senators, and predicted that the trade would turn out to be a Tiger heist.
The McLain trade occurred despite objections from Senators manager Ted Williams, who reportedly disagreed with the decision.[40] The feeling was mutual; early in the 1971 season, McLain became a charter member of the ""Underminers' Club"", a group of five players dedicated to getting Williams fired. They spent much of the season feuding over Williams' use of a then-unusual five-man rotation for his starters. Senators broadcaster Shelby Whitfield later told Rob Neyer that when Williams yanked McLain early from a July 5 game against the Cleveland Indians, McLain threatened to call Senators owner Bob Short and have him get rid of Williams.[41]
By this time, McLain had serious arm trouble, inadvertently made worse by numerous cortisone shots he took for his sore arm.[40] As a result, he essentially stopped throwing fastballs midway through the 1971 season.[41] Due to his arm troubles and his inability to get along with Williams, McLain went 10–22.[1] He thus earned the dubious distinction of going from leading his league in wins (tied with Mike Cuellar with 24 wins in 1969) to two years later leading his league in losses.[2] McLain's 22 defeats (a mark later tied by three pitchers, all in 1974) remains the most in a major-league season since Jack Fisher of the Mets lost 24 in 1965.
After the 1971 season, McLain was traded to the Oakland Athletics for journeyman pitcher Jim Panther and prospect Don Stanhouse (who went on to have a few good years as the Baltimore Orioles' closer in the late 1970s).[41] After only five starts, one win, and a 6.04 ERA, the Athletics sent him to the minor leagues on May 15. The Associated Press said the reasons for the demotion were ""pitches which lacked steam and a medical problem.""[42] On June 29, Oakland traded him to the Atlanta Braves for Orlando Cepeda;[43] he went only 3–5 for Atlanta, and his overall totals for 1972 were 4–7 with a 6.37 ERA. His final major league appearance came on September 12 against the Cincinnati Reds; he came into a tied game in the ninth and promptly gave up three runs without retiring a batter, taking the loss. (Coincidentally, the last batter McLain ever faced in the major leagues was Pete Rose, who also was involved in a gambling scandal years later.)[1] The Braves released McLain during spring training, on March 26, 1973.[44] After short stints with minor-league clubs in Des Moines and Shreveport, McLain retired.[6] Three years after winning 31 games and two years after winning his second consecutive Cy Young, he was out of baseball at the age of 29.[4]
McLain's success on the playing field led to endorsement opportunities from the Hammond Organ Company; he also made musical appearances in Las Vegas.[45] He was invited to appear with his musical quartet on The Ed Sullivan Show along with his World Series opponent (and guitarist) Bob Gibson.[46] McLain also made appearances on The Steve Allen Show and The Joey Bishop Show.[47] He also released two albums on Capitol Records, Denny McLain at the Organ (1968) and Denny McLain in Las Vegas (1969).[48]
In a 10-year major-league career, McLain won 131 games against 91 losses. His career earned run average was 3.39 and he recorded 1,282 strikeouts in 1,886 innings pitched.  McLain was a three-time All-Star and won the Cy Young Award twice in his career.  Because he relied so much on his fastball, he also surrendered numerous home runs, leading the American League in home runs allowed in three consecutive years (1966–1968).[1][47]
Since McLain's 31-win season, only two other pitchers have approached the 30-game milestone (Steve Carlton won 27 games in 1972 and Bob Welch also with 27 victories in 1990).[49] With Major League Baseball teams transitioning from the four-man pitching rotation of McLain's era to five-man rotations, and with the increased reliance on relief pitchers, some observers believe that another 30-game winner may not occur because of the way the game is played today.[12][49]
In 1974, McLain played a season for the London Majors of the Intercounty Baseball League at Labatt Memorial Park in London, Ontario. Because of his arm problems, McLain pitched only nine innings for the Majors, but played in 14 games at shortstop, first base, or catcher, and batted .380, including hitting two homers in one game in London.
McLain continued to earn side money playing the organ at clubs, including a club in suburban Detroit where former heavyweight boxing champion Leon Spinks worked as a bartender.[50] McLain also earned quite a bit of money hustling golf, easily attracting ""marks"" due to his past baseball fame.  Additionally, he reportedly once accepted over $160,000 to fly a wanted felon out of the country.[4]
McLain's weight ballooned to 330 pounds (150 kg) during his post-baseball career.  He was imprisoned for drug trafficking (cocaine), embezzlement, and racketeering. Tampa attorneys Arnold Levine and Stevan Northcutt, who later became a Florida state appellate judge, represented McLain before the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Atlanta. His conviction was reversed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act  in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Tampa.[2]
Between his stints in prison and rehabilitation in the mid-1980s to the early-1990s, McLain could be found on various talk radio sports shows and occasionally on panel-format sports shows on network television in the Detroit area; he also modeled Hanes underwear.[51] He could also be found signing autographs at a metro Detroit 7-Eleven store at the corner of Mound Road and Metro Parkway in Sterling Heights, Michigan, where he was employed on work-release.[2] After his release, he also hosted a popular daily talk radio show for a few years on Detroit talk station WXYT.
McLain's oldest daughter, Kristin, 26, was killed on March 20, 1992, in a drunk-driving crash.[4] She had been living in Florida and was moving back home to Michigan when she was killed just a few miles from her parents' home.[52] In part to escape his grief, McLain and several partners bought the Peet Packing Company (Farmer Peet's) located in the small town of Chesaning, Michigan, in 1994.[53] McLain was also a partner in the Michigan Radio Network.[citation needed] Both companies went bankrupt two years later.[citation needed] In 1996, he was convicted on charges of embezzlement, mail fraud, and conspiracy in connection with the theft of $2.5 million from the Peet employees' pension fund.[5][54]  McLain spent six years in prison; in 2008, he insisted that he knew nothing about the shady financial deals alleged by the government. McLain claims he paid restitution for this incident.[55]
During the Detroit Tigers 2006 playoff run, McLain was the baseball analyst for Drew and Mike on WRIF radio in Detroit. In 2007, McLain released his autobiography I Told You I Wasn't Perfect, co-authored by longtime Detroit sportscaster and author Eli Zaret. Prior to that, McLain and Zaret hosted a sports television show together in Detroit.
McLain currently resides in Pinckney, Michigan. McLain writes a monthly editorial column and blogs regularly for In Play! Magazine, a Detroit sports magazine.
Kevin Costner's character in the 2005 film The Upside of Anger was partly based on McLain (and also partly on Kirk Gibson, another Tiger of World Series note).[56]
On April 11, 2008, McLain was arrested without incident after deputies discovered an outstanding warrant against him for failing to appear for a January 16 court hearing.[57]
On September 22, 2011, McLain was arrested in Port Huron, Michigan at the Canada–United States border after officials discovered an outstanding warrant against him from St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. Because of construction detours, McLain had inadvertently taken an exit off I-94, sending him directly across the Blue Water Bridge and into Canada. He immediately returned to the U.S., where he was obligated to go through U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspection. The outstanding warrant was then discovered, for which McLain was jailed in Port Huron. In less than a week, the warrant was cleared and McLain was released.[58]
From 2017 to 2018, McLain hosted a Sunday radio show about life and politics on WFDF (AM).[59]
In January 2019 McLain and former local sportscasters Eli Zaret and Bob Page launched a podcast called No Filter Sports.
In October 2020, McLain held an estate sale hosted by Aaron's Estate Sales. This event was covered nationally by outlets such as ESPN and the Associated Press.[60][61][62]

Corey Allen Pavin (born November 16, 1959) is an American professional golfer. In 1982, Pavin turned professional but failed at PGA Tour Qualifying School. The following year, he turned to overseas where he had much success, winning South Africa's Lexington PGA and Europe's German Open. Later in the year he earned PGA Tour membership and had much success on tour, winning a number of events, culminating with the 1995 U.S. Open championship. Soon thereafter, he abruptly lost his game and was rarely a contender. As a senior, Pavin has played on the PGA Tour Champions, recording one win, at the Allianz Championship.
Pavin was born in Oxnard, California, the son of Barbara and Jack Pavin.[3][4][5] He attended Oxnard High School.[6]
Pavin attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).[7] He won two gold medals at the 1981 Maccabiah Games, the Jewish Olympics in Israel.[8][9][10][11]
In 1982, Pavin turned professional. He was ""an unexpected failure"" at 1982 PGA Tour Qualifying School.[12] He did not move past the regional qualifying section.[13] He turned to play overseas in 1983. Early in the year, he played on the Southern African Tour where he ""won his first professional tournament"" at the Lexington PGA.[12] It was only his fourth tournament as a professional golfer.[13] He soon moved onto the European Tour. In July, he finished solo 3rd, only behind Sam Torrance and Craig Stadler, at the Scandinavian Enterprise Open. A month later, Pavin won the German Open three strokes ahead of joint runner-up Seve Ballesteros. He finished 13th on the Order of Merit.
Pavin's first PGA Tour victory came at the 1984 Houston Coca-Cola Open. He won at least one event significant domestic or international event over the next decade and topped the PGA Tour's money list in 1991. Pavin's success culminated in his only major victory, the 1995 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club. Pavin went into the final round three strokes behind Greg Norman and Tom Lehman. On the 72nd and final hole of the tournament, a 450 yards long par 4, Pavin produced a four wood, considered one of the great shots in U.S. Open history, 228 yards to five feet of the hole to secure the title.
Rather than marking a move to a new level of achievement, however, this was soon followed by a long slide down the world rankings from a high ranking of 2nd.[14] After Pavin won the Bank of America Colonial in 1996, he did not win another PGA Tour tournament for ten years. His 89th-place finish on the 2004 money list was the first time he had made the top one hundred since 1998. Pavin finally won his 15th career title in 2006 at the U.S. Bank Championship in Milwaukee, ending a streak of 242 consecutive tournaments without a win.
On July 27, 2006, during the first round of what would become his 15th tour title, Pavin broke the record for the fewest strokes needed to complete nine holes at a PGA Tour event, with an 8-under par score of 26. The previous record of 27 strokes was held by Mike Souchak, Andy North, Billy Mayfair and Robert Gamez, with Mayfair and Gamez' scores being 9-under par.[15] His 36-hole total of 125 also tied the record for fewest shots taken in the first 36 holes of a PGA Tour event held by Tom Lehman, Mark Calcavecchia, and Tiger Woods.[16]
After acting as an assistant to U.S. Ryder Cup captain Tom Lehman in 2006, Pavin was in December 2008 by the PGA of America, named captain for the U.S. team at the 2010 Ryder Cup at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Wales.[17] In October 2010, the U.S. Ryder Cup team lost 13½ to 14½, against the European side.[18]

Pavin began playing on the Champions Tour in 2010. In June 2010, he lost in a sudden death playoff to Bubba Watson at the Travelers Championship on the PGA Tour. In his 35th start, Pavin won his maiden Champions Tour event in February 2012 at the Allianz Championship. He defeated Peter Senior at the first sudden death playoff hole with a birdie to take the title, after having finished regulation play at 11 under.In April 1983, Pavin married Shannon Healy.[12] They have two children. He married Lisa Nguyen in 2003.[19][20]
He was the only top Jewish player on the tour until 1991.[21][22][23][24][25] In that year, he converted to Christianity.[26][27][28][29][30] He was named the 117th-greatest Jewish athlete in the 2007 book The Big Book of Jewish Sports Heroes by Peter S. Horvitz.[31]
Pavin is a Republican. During the 1993 Ryder Cup, Pavin was originally unwilling to meet with president Bill Clinton before the cup owing to their differing political views. Pavin stated that he had voted for Bush, and so was not particularly excited at the prospect of meeting Clinton.[32]
Pavin made a cameo appearance playing himself in the 1996 movie Tin Cup starring Kevin Costner. In the movie, Pavin tells Fred Couples, ""It's hard to believe that a guy named 'Tin Cup' might have his name beneath mine on the trophy.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Open,Valero Texas Open,"The Texas Open, known as the Valero Texas Open for sponsorship reasons, is a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour, played near San Antonio, Texas. It dates back 103 years to 1922, when it was first called the Texas Open; San Antonio-based Valero Energy Corporation took over naming rights in 2002. It is played at The Oaks Course at the TPC San Antonio, north of the city. The Valero Energy Foundation is the host organization for the Valero Texas Open.
The event is managed by Wasserman Media Group as of 2017.[2] In 2003, it was the site of the 72-hole PGA Tour scoring record of 254, shot by Tommy Armour III.[3] Many big-name players have won this tournament, including Sam Snead, Ben Hogan, and Arnold Palmer, who won it three years in a row. It has always been considered a tournament where it is relatively easy to shoot low scores. Since 1934, every tournament winner has finished with a score under-par.
It has always been played in the San Antonio area,[4] and is the sixth oldest professional golf tournament worldwide, the third oldest on the PGA Tour and the longest held in the same city.  The tournament has been hosted on eight different golf courses. From its inception until 1940, it was held at Brackenridge Park Golf Course, with the exception of 1927–1928, when it was played at Willow Springs Golf Course. After the event left Brackenridge Park, it returned to Willow Springs (1941–1949). In 1950 and 1951, it was played at both Brackenridge Park and Ft. Sam Houston Golf Course; afterwards it stayed at Brackenridge Park, with the exception of 1956 and 1960, when it returned to Ft. Sam Houston.
Oak Hills Country Club hosted from 1961 to 1966, then it went to Pecan Valley Golf Club (1967–1970). There was no event in 1968, as Pecan Valley was the site of the PGA Championship in July. No event was held in 1971; it was played at Woodlake Golf Club for five editions (1972–1976), then returned to Oak Hills (1977–1994). (No event was held in 1987, as Oak Hills hosted the first Tour Championship in late October.) 
It was held at the Resort Course at La Cantera Golf Club (1995–2009), then moved to its present site on The Oaks Course at TPC San Antonio, in the affluent Cibolo Canyon community, in 2010.[5]
The Texas Open was usually held in September or October; in 2007 and 2008, the event was demoted to the Fall Series. With the demise of the Atlanta Classic, the PGA Tour moved the Texas Open into that slot on the schedule in May 2009 and it became a regular FedEx Cup event.[6] The 2009 event offered an increased purse of $6.1 million (up from $4.5 million) and its winner's share exceeded $1 million for the first time. In 2011, the event moved to the week following the Masters Tournament; that 2011 edition is best known for Kevin Na's 16 (+12) on the ninth hole in the opening round.
As a Fall Series event, the Valero Texas Open was the alternate tournament to the Presidents and Ryder Cups. In 2013, the tournament was in early April, the week before The Masters, and aired on NBC for the first time; several European Tour players participated in the Texas Open for the first time since the mid-1980s.
Since Valero became title sponsor in 2002, the tournament has become the annual leader in charitable fundraising among PGA Tour events. In 2015, the Valero Texas Open became only the fourth PGA Tour event to eclipse the $100 million milestone in funds raised for charity.  The 2021 Valero Texas Open raised a record breaking $16 million for charity, bringing the grand total to over $187 million in charitable giving.
In 2019, the Valero Texas Open returned to being played before The Masters, thereby shifting the weekend coverage from CBS to NBC.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Valero Texas Open was cancelled just three weeks before taking place but returned in 2021, the week before The Masters.

Zombies are fictional creatures usually portrayed as reanimated corpses or virally infected human beings. They are commonly portrayed as anthropophagous in nature—labeling them as cannibals would imply zombies are still members of the human species, and expert opinions quoted in some of the films below, e.g. Dawn of the Dead, specifically state this is not the case. While zombie films generally fall into the horror genre, some cross over into other genres, such as comedy, science fiction, thriller, or romance. Distinct subgenres have evolved, such as the ""zombie comedy"" (Zom Com), ""romantic comedy with zombies"" (Rom Com Zom) and ""zombie apocalypse"". Zombies are distinct from ghosts, ghouls, mummies, Frankenstein's monsters or vampires, so this list does not include films devoted to these types of undead.[1][2]
Victor Halperin's White Zombie, released in 1932, is often cited as the first zombie film.[3][4][5]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_prison_film,Women-in-prison film,"The women-in-prison film (or WiP film) is a subgenre of exploitation film that began in the early 20th century and continues to the present day.[1]
Their stories feature imprisoned women who are subjected to sexual and physical abuse, typically by sadistic prison wardens, guards, and other inmates. The genre also features many films in which imprisoned women engage in lesbian sex.
As they are traditionally constructed, WiP films are works of fiction intended as pornography. The films of this genre include a mixture of erotic adventures of the women in prison.[2] The flexible format, and the loosening of film censorship laws in the 1960s, allowed filmmakers to depict more extreme fetishes, such as voyeurism (strip searches, group shower scenes, catfights), sexual fantasies, fetishism (bondage, whipping, degradation), and sadism (beatings, torture, cruelty).
Prior to these films, another expression of pornographic women in prison was found in ""true adventure"" men's magazines such as Argosy in the 1950s and 1960s, although it is possible that Denis Diderot's novel The Nun anticipated the genre. Nazis tormenting damsels in distress were particularly common in these magazines.
Most women-in-prison films employ the same stock characters and formulaic situations. Characters that are fellow inmates may include a sarcastic prostitute, a manipulative snitch, or an aggressive lesbian. The female criminals are usually hypersexualized and fetishize homosexual relationships.[3] The authority figure of the prison is usually a cruel woman who herself is a variation of the traditional prison lesbian.[4] Common scenes in women in prison films may include:
The narrative peaks with some kind of rebellion, which may include a fight, attempted break out, or natural disaster such as a prison fire or earthquake.[4] The story then follows with an uprising or escape sequence in which the villains are killed and the prisoner is freed. Occasionally a new inmate is an undercover reporter investigating corruption as in Bare Behind Bars or a government agent sent to rescue a political prisoner (Caged Heat 2: Stripped of Freedom, Love Camp 7). Most commonly, the prisoner is reunited with a man (a lover, father, or priest) who guides her to goodness so she can reestablish her life with familial and heterosexual relationships.[4]
In the silent era, only a few films featured women as leading characters in crime dramas. A silent film star who perfected such roles was Priscilla Dean, most notably in The Wicked Darling (1919) and Outside the Law (1920).
But it was not until the 1930s that Hollywood began making movies partially set in women's prisons, such as Up the River (1930), with Claire Luce, Ladies They Talk About (1933), with Barbara Stanwyck, Hold Your Man (1933), with Jean Harlow, and Girls on Probation (1938), with Jane Bryan, but generally, only a small part of the action took place inside the institution. Women-in-prison films developed in the 1930s as melodramas in which young heroines were shown the way to a righteous life by way of the prison. Under the influence of pulp magazines and paperbacks, they became popular B movies during this period.  It was not until the 1950s, beginning with the release of Caged (1950), starring Eleanor Parker and Agnes Moorehead, So Young, So Bad (also 1950), with Anne Francis and Rita Moreno, Women's Prison (1955) with Ida Lupino and Cleo Moore and, in Great Britain, The Weak and the Wicked (1954), with Glynis Johns and Diana Dors, that an entire film was set inside a women's correctional facility.
Several films were made about women prisoners interned by the Germans and Japanese during the Second World War such as Two Thousand Women and Three Came Home.
The film that kicked off the genre in a new direction was Jesús Franco's 99 Women, which was a big box office success in the U.S. in 1969. That year Love Camp 7 was also among the first pure exploitation films that influenced the women in prison and Nazi exploitation genres.
From 1979 to 1986, Australian Television's hit women's incarceration drama, Prisoner: Cell Block H, ran to 692 episodes.
In 1999, the popular TV series Bad Girls was released on Britain's television network, ITV. Bad Girls took a turn from the usual prison drama seen before to show a different perspective of women's lives and sexuality in prison. Sociologist Didi Herman states, ""Unlike other mainstream television products that may have lesbian or gay characters within a prevailing context of heteronormativity, [Bad Girls] represents lesbian sexuality as normal, desirable,  and possible.""[5]
A number of the WiP films remain banned by the BBFC in the United Kingdom. Among them are  Love Camp 7 (rejected in 2022) and Women in Cellblock 9 (rejected in 2004), on the grounds that they contain substantial scenes of sexual violence and in the case of the latter an actress who at 16 was under age at the time of production, rendering it child pornography under U.K. law.[6]
Examples of traditional WiP films set in the U.S. include: The Concrete Jungle (1982), and Chained Heat (1983) with Linda Blair, Tamara Dobson and Sybil Danning, Cell Block Sisters (1995), Caged Hearts (1995), Bad Girls Dormitory (1985), Under Lock & Key, Caged Fear (1991), Caged (1950), Freeway (1996) with Reese Witherspoon and Brittany Murphy, and Stranger Inside (2001).
American tourists are incarcerated overseas in Chained Heat 2 (1993) with Brigitte Nielsen and Red Heat (1985) with Linda Blair.  Both films are about innocent women who are thrown into foreign prisons and forced to face sadistic guards and brutal rape. Mainstream, non-exploitation prison films dealing with this theme include Bangkok Hilton (1989) starring Nicole Kidman and Brokedown Palace (1999) with Claire Danes, both which are set in Thailand and are focused on women who are imprisoned for smuggling drugs.  Also Prison Heat (1993 film), set in Turkey, is about four innocent American women who are mistakenly thrown in prison for cocaine possession.
Jonathan Demme's Caged Heat (1974) is one of the better known WiP films and has a cult following due to its tongue-in-cheek approach and casting of horror icon Barbara Steele as the warden. Demme also co-wrote The Hot Box in 1972, which is about female prisoners who break free and start a rebellion against their captors.
In recent years, films that parody or pay homage to the classic WiP films of the '70s have emerged such as Cody Jarrett's Sugar Boxx (2009) and Steve Balderson's Stuck! (2010). Both of these films mimic classic WiP films by including typical WiP film characters, predictable scenes, and similar plots overall.
Italian exploitation directors have produced scores of WiP films with far more graphic sex and violence than those produced in the U.S.
Bruno Mattei directed Women's Prison Massacre (1985), Caged Women (1982), and Jail — A Women's Hell (2006).  Other films include Women in Fury (1985) and Caged Women in Purgatory (1991).
The Nazi exploitation subgenre centers on the same theme of captive women suffering abuses in war-time prison camps.  Many of these films were developed in the late 1970s and the early 1980s as the industry continued to grow. Films such as SS Experiment Love Camp, SS Camp 5: Women's Hell, Hell Behind the Bars and Hell Penitentiary directed by Sergio Garrone in 1983, Gestapo's Last Orgy (1977) directed by Cesare Canevari, Helga, She Wolf of Spilberg (1978) and Fraulein Devil (1977) directed by Patrice Rhomm, SS Hell Camp (1977) directed by Luigi Batzella, Women in Cell Block 7 (1973) directed by Rino Di Silvestro and  Nazi Love Camp 27 (1977) directed by Mario Caiano were partly inspired by the U.S./Canadian Ilsa series.
The abuse of Chinese women in Japanese detention or prisoner-of-war camps during World War II is depicted in a series of Hong Kong films. Prime examples include Bamboo House of Dolls (1973) with Birte Tove, and Great Escape from a Women's Prison. Comfort Women (1992), which is based on real events. Chinese prostitutes are abducted by Japanese soldiers and used for brutal scientific experiments at the notorious Unit 731 medical camp.
A Chinese Torture Chamber Story (1994) and its sequel are based on historical records of China's Qing dynasty. The topic of sex ""is usually considered taboo in traditional Chinese society"", which makes the film industry scandalous and frowned upon by many.
One of the very early examples of the genre in Japan began with Death row Woman, a noir drama made by the master of J-horror Nobuo Nakagawa in 1960, although the plot doesn't focus entirely inside of the prison. After, the women prison films are often made into a series based on popular characters from manga comics such as Prisoner Maria and the Joshu Sasori series, most known by the Meiko Kaji films. Many Japanese films include themes of vengeance and retribution with a heroine who take revenge against the drug or prostitution syndicates responsible for her incarceration. In the film Female Convict 701: Scorpion, the audience ""can see a story of Japanese women in captivity, with lots of very life-like scenes"" because Japanese directors desire to produce ""natural looking stories"" to enhance the reality of the situation.
The ""jungle prison"" subgenre has films set in fictional banana republics run by corrupt dictators in either South America or Southeast Asia. The majority of these were filmed in the Philippines, where production costs are low. Here, a group of nubile prisoners are herded together in a stockade prison camp and used as slave labor, doing tasks such as cutting sugar cane or digging in a quarry. These films usually involve a revolution subplot with political prisoners freed by other inmates in a climactic raid where the villains are killed. Actress Pam Grier starred in several Filipino jungle films such as Roger Corman's The Big Doll House and its sequel The Big Bird Cage, plus Women in Cages, and Black Mama White Mama (story co-written by Jonathan Demme).
Sweet Sugar (1972) starred Phyllis Davis, Caged Heat 2: Stripped of Freedom (1994) featured Jewel Shepard as an undercover agent. The especially brutal Escape from Hell, a.k.a. Escape  (1979) and its sequel Hotel Paradise came from Italy. Jesús Franco's Sadomania features scenes such as gladiator fights to the death and prisoners hunted like animals in an alligator-infested swamp.
The nunsploitation (nun exploitation) subgenre emerged at the same time as the WiP film and is composed of the same basic elements. The stories are set in isolated convents that resemble prisons where sexually repressed nuns are driven to rampant lesbian sex and perversity.
The Mother Superior is usually a cruel and corrupt warden-like martinet. The nuns are treated like convicts, with rule-breakers subjected to whippings or Inquisition-style tortures. The added element of religious guilt entails scenes of masochism and self-flagellation.
The WiP film has also expanded into other areas and film genres such as horror and science fiction.
A notable European horror-hybrid is the 1969 Spanish film, The House That Screamed.  A psycho-killer lurks in a house for wayward girls run by a harsh disciplinarian (Lilli Palmer). This groundbreaking film has influenced many others, particularly the Dario Argento thriller Suspiria.
Human Experiments (1979), and Hellhole (1985) are two examples of a spate of horror films where prisoners are experimented on by mad scientists.
Werewolf in a Women's Prison (2006) draws from the monster-movie genre.
Caged Heat 3000 (1995) stars Lisa Boyle (a.k.a. Cassandra Leigh) as an inmate on an asteroid prison.  Includes futuristic touches such as electric bra torment and cattle prod-like sticks.
Star Slammer, a.k.a. Prison Ship (1986) is one of several low-budget space sagas set in the future.[7]
Chained Heat 3: Hell Mountain (1998) and Chained Rage: Slave to Love (2002) are both set in a barbaric post-nuclear world where slaves are forced to toil in the mines.
Terminal Island (1973) with Phyllis Davis, Tom Selleck, and Marta Kristen and Caged in Paradise (1989) starring Irene Cara are both set on isolated island penal colonies with no prisons or guards. Inmates are simply stranded there and must fend for themselves. The 1985 Japanese film Banished Behind Bars has a similar theme.
Janet Perlman's satirical graphic novel Penguins Behind Bars is a parody of the women in prison genre. It was later adapted by Perlman as an animated short which aired in the U.S. on Cartoon Network.[8][9]
In recent years, North American Pictures, the Canadian makers of Chained Heat 2 set up a separate production company in the Czech Republic called Bound Heat Films for creating R-rated, erotic WiP, Nazisploitation, and female slavery films. Many of these star Rena Riffel (from Showgirls). Titles include: School of Surrender, Dark Confessions, Stories from Slave Life, No Escape, Caligula's Spawn, Slave Huntress, and Bound Cargo.[10]  While not technically considered pornography the nudity in many of the scenes in these films draws on fetishes as a dramatic element.
Bars and Stripes is a video producer that maintains a website entirely devoted to its line of prison-based BDSM fetish films. A stable of recurring ""inmates"" are listed with mug shots and information. Most of the films are part of a continuing story. Other companies that exclusively produce prison fetish films include Chain Gang Girls, CagedTushy.com, and SpankCamp.com.
Cheryl Dunye is an independent film producer who produced the prison drama Stranger Inside (2001) about a young African American women who purposely misbehaves in juvenile detention to get transferred to the women's prison in an effort to reunite with her imprisoned mother.[11]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menudo_(group),Menudo (group),"
Menudo is a Puerto Rican boy band formed by producer Edgardo Díaz.[1] Referred to as the ""most iconic Latino pop music band"",[2] they have been ranked as one of the biggest boy bands of all time by several publications, including Billboard, Us Weekly, Seventeen, and Teen Vogue, being the only Latin band on their lists.[3][4][5][6]
The band had several radio hits during its career. They acted in a television film (1979's Leyenda de Amor[7]) and two feature films, An Adventure Called Menudo (Una aventura llamada Menudo) and Menudo: The Movie (Menudo: La Película), in three mini series entitled ""I Want to Be"", ""It's for Love"" and ""Forever Friends"" (""Quiero Ser"", ""Es Por Amor"" and ""Por Siempre Amigos"") and another television mini-series named Panchito and Arturo (Panchito y Arturo).[8]
Due to changes in puberty-related vocal range and timbre becoming permanent at around the age of 17, Menudo was distinctive in that, where members of the band were let go at that age, and younger vocalists took their place. In fact over the course of the band's history, it had run through more than fifty members, for this very reason. At any one time however, the Menudo band was usually, except for two isolated eras, composed of five male teenagers.[9]
Menudo's original lineup consisted of five boys: brothers Fernando and Nefty Sallaberry (ages 12 and 13); the Melendez brothers, Carlos Meléndez, (age 12), Óscar Meléndez, (age 11), and Ricky Meléndez, (age 9); the latter three are Díaz's cousins.[10] The band's golden-era lineup[according to whom?] consisted of members Ricky Meléndez, Johnny Lozada, René Farrait, Miguel Cancel, Xavier Serbiá, Charlie Masso and Ray Reyes. It was also a starting point for popular international stars like Ricky Martin (1984–89) and Draco Rosa (1984–87), who were members of the band in the mid-1980s.
Entering the 1990s, their popularity started to wane amid allegations of drug use. In 1997, the rights and the name Menudo were sold. The remaining members continued to perform as MDO until their official disbandment in 2002. However, this iteration has continued to perform sporadically since. New management of Menudo formed a new line-up in 2007, releasing an EP but disbanding in 2009. Some of the members of the ""golden era"" of the band reunited in 1998 under the name El Reencuentro, and in 2019 for the ""Get on My Motorcycle"" (""Súbete a Mi Moto Tour"").[11]
Menudo is estimated to have sold 20 million albums worldwide and has generated over 300 million US dollars.[12][13]
Menudo was formed in 1977 by music producer Edgardo Díaz. The original line up consisted of 5 members, the Sallaberry brothers, Fernando and Nefty, and Díaz's cousins, the Melendez brothers, Oscar, Carlos, and Ricky.[14] They were signed to Padosa Records and released their first album Los Fantasmas in 1977. It featured ""Teach Me To Sing"" (""Enséñame a cantar""), a song by Spanish singer Micky. In 1978 they released another album called Laura. Fifteen-year-old Nefty was the very first member to leave and was replaced by 12-year-old René Farrait. In 1979, they released an album called Little Girl (Chiquitita). At the end of 1979, Carlos left the band at age 15 and was replaced by 12-year-old Johnny Lozada, after which they made their first Christmas album, Congratulations (""Felicidades"").
In the early 1980s, Menudo had several hits, including ""The Ghosts"" (""Los Fantasmas"") and a cover version of ABBA's ""Do You Want"" (""Voulez-Vous""). They filmed three music videos for the song ""Little Girl"" (""Chiquitita""), including one with Puerto Rican music star Ednita Nazario (who sang with them and played the titular ""Chiquitita"" on the video).[15] The group then released several moderately successful albums, including Fuego (Fire), which yielded hits ""Ella A-A"" (""Her""), ""Fuego"" (""Fire""), and ""A Bailar"" (""To Dance"").[16] They also made ""Fui Hecho Para Amarte"", which itself was also a cover, in that song's case of KISS's '""I Was Made For Lovin' You"",[17] but that song was not included in Fuego, and was released on their Xanadu album instead.
During 1981, the group, which by then consisted of René Farrait (14), Johnny Lozada (13), Xavier Serbiá (13), Miguel Cancel (13), and remaining original member Ricky Melendez (13), released ""I Want to Be"" (""Quiero Ser""). The album would launch Menudo into international stardom. It included hit songs such as  ""I Want to Be"" (""Quiero Ser""), ""Get on My Motorcycle"" (""Súbete A Mi Moto""), ""Rock on TV"" (""Rock En La TV""), ""Clarity"" (""Claridad""), and ""My Band Plays Rock"" (""Mi Banda Toca Rock""). They also had their own telenovela series entitled I Want To Be
(Quiero Ser).
In the same year, the group hosted a television show on Telemundo entitled Menudo Young People (Gente Joven de Menudo). They hosted a yearly beauty pageant, ""Menudo's young girl"" (""La chica joven de Menudo"") and the winner of the pageant would sometimes appear in the band's videos or join them onstage at their concerts throughout the United States.
Menudo became very popular throughout Latin America, from Mexico to Argentina, and Brazil. They also became the first boy band to own their own private jet. Díaz, their manager, purchased a Lockheed JetStar that had belonged to American President Richard Nixon and the Shah of Iran. He had Menudo's name emblazoned on both sides of the fuselage. In 1982, Charlie Masso, then age 12, replaced René Farrait, age 14. Masso's first album with Menudo was ""For Love"" (""Por Amor""). During this boom of popularity, fans started calling themselves contagious to the ""Menuditis"", similar to Beatlemania and Bieber Fever, or the ""Menudomania"". They were so popular that they starred in their own feature films: Menudo: The Movie and An Adventure Called Menudo. Aventura starred Gladys Rodríguez as Miss Mia (""Señora Mía"") and included songs such as ""Clara"" and ""Fly"" (""A Volar"").
During their first visit to New York in early 1983, Ray Reyes, 12, replaced Xavier Serbiá, 14. Their American fanbase grew, especially among the young, as evidenced by Menudo on ABC, a
series of four minute music spots that aired during the Fall 1983 season of ABC's youth-oriented Saturday-morning programming block.[18] They also sang the theme song for ABC's Rubik, the Amazing Cube. Miguel Cancel became the first member to voluntarily quit the group. According to a 1998 interview, he was unhappy that a sudden voice change rendered him unable to sing his songs, so he opted to leave before his scheduled departure. He was replaced by Roy Rosselló, 13. Menudo signed a six-year multimillion-dollar contract with RCA International and released their Spanish album A Todo Rock (Full of Rock). According to Time magazine, at the end of July, the group had already sold 3 million copies worldwide,[18] 750,000 in USA only.[18]
Around that time, Menudo merchandise began to be mass-produced. Merchandise included Menudo dolls, which appeared in the United States and Latin American toy markets in 1984,[19] Menudo Topps trading cards,[20] wristwatches,[21] fotonovelas, fanzines, T-shirts, a 1981 board game named ""Menudo Karshow""[22][23] and other clothing accessories and school supplies. In 1984, Robby Rosa (now known as Draco Rosa), 14, replaced Johnny Lozada, 16, just in time for Menudo to release their first English-language album, Reaching Out, which featured the theme track ""Like a Cannonball"" for the Hollywood movie Cannonball Run 2; and their first Portuguese album, Mania, both featuring versions of some of their Spanish hits. During the first half of 1984, Menudo toured the U.S. and Brazil. The Spanish version ""Como Cannonball"" was used in the Filipino youth movie Bagets 2 and also featured the song ""Fly Away"".
On September 16, 1984, Ricky Melendez, 16, the sole remaining original member, left the group. Up until then, he was the only Menudo member to remain with the group for seven years. He was replaced by Ricky Martin, then 12, who debuted on the album, Evolución (Evolution). During this time, Menudo's popularity reached parts of Asia including Japan and the Philippines, and the group made English-language commercials for Pepsi, Scope, Burger King, McDonald's, and Crest. They also made a guest appearance on the popular American children's program Sesame Street. By the end of September, sales of their records surpassed 8 million copies worldwide.[24] Then, much to the surprise of fans and himself, Ray Reyes, 15, departed the group earlier than expected, due to internal conflicts between Ray's father and the manager (information recently confirmed by his brother Raúl Reyes[citation needed]). In a 1998 interview, Reyes stated he was surprised when during a Menudo interview in 1985, the interviewer asked who would leave the group next and Edgardo Díaz named Ray. The group also had a weekly television show called ""Menudo Mania"".
Raymond Acevedo (13) took over Reyes' spot in 1985 and Menudo sang vocals for the Spanish-English song ""Cantare, Cantaras"" (I Will Sing, You Will Sing) with various Latin artists to raise money for UNICEF. This song was the Latin American version of ""We Are the World"". ""Cantare, Cantaras"" was recorded on April 9, 1985, at the A&M Studios. The group released their second English-language album, Menudo which contains the songs ""Hold Me"" (#62 Billboard Hot 100, RCA 14087)[25] and ""Explosion"", both with lead vocals by Robi Rosa. They also released their next Spanish album, Ayer Y Hoy (Yesterday And Today), and their second Portuguese album A Festa Vai Comecar (The Party Is Going To Start). They successfully toured Brazil, performing before hundreds of thousands of fans, but there were allegations of the tour being poorly organized: the capacity for a concert in Rio de Janeiro was 60,000 but 70,000 tickets were sold, and 2 women died. In São Paulo, a 100,000-capacity stadium was sold-out with 200,000 people, and in the São Paulo city of Campinas, rain delayed a concert for 4 hours.
In 1986, the song King Holiday was recorded. Later in the year Roy Rosselló (15) was replaced by Sergio Blass (13) but no farewell concert was held.  According to a book written by Raymond Acevedo's father in 2012 titled ""Papi, Quiero Ser Un Menudo,"" Roy threatened to expose management irregularities to the press and was given a huge sum of money to leave the group due to his behavior as it was deemed by creator Edgardo Diaz as ""uncontrollable."" At this time, Menudo's management started bending the rules a little and started allowing members to remain in the group after reaching the age limit. Sergio had been in two Puerto Rican groups prior to joining Menudo; the first being Concepto Juvenil from 1983 to 1985, and then Los Chicos de Puerto Rico, for a few months in 1985. The group released several albums that year, starting with their only Italian album, Viva! Bravo!, which they showcased in Italy in the San Remo Music Festival. The Spanish album Refrescante (Refreshing), the English album Can't Get Enough, and the Portuguese album Menudo followed respectively, then came tours of the U.S., Latin America (including Brazil), and the Philippines.
In October 1986, Ralphy Rodriguez (13) entered the group to replace Charlie (17) just as the group began facing internal conflicts. First, Robby (17) quit without warning in the midst of a Brazilian tour, becoming the third member to quit voluntarily. Menudo's Summer in the Street U.S. tour introduced new member Rubén Gómez (13).
At that point, the group underwent a complete image makeover, changing their look to a rougher, more rugged, rock-n-roll-like look. Members were Ralphy, Ruben, Ricky Martin, Sérgio and Raymond: this formation became known as Los Hijos Del Rock. Their music, formerly described as bubblegum-pop, underwent a similar change. They released the Spanish album Somos Los Hijos del Rock (We Are The Sons Of Rock), followed by an English-Tagalog album for the Philippines titled In Action with Ralphy and Rubén. In late 1987, Ralphy's parents pulled him from the group. Charlie was again asked to fill in during the Philippines tour, which would be their last as their popularity there waned.
In early 1988, Angelo García (11) replaced Ralphy Rodríguez (14) and they released their final English-language album, Sons of Rock, scoring an international hit, ""You Got Potential"". Another song, ""TLC"" (aka A Little TLC), featured lead vocals by Ricky Martin. In August 1988, Raymond Acevedo's contract was about to expire, but he decided to leave before auditions were held for his replacement, and Menudo performed as a quartet for a few months before Robert Avellanet (13) took over. The album Sombras Y Figuras was released at the end of the year. During 1989, longtime member Ricky Martin (17) left the group to pursue a solo career. Rawy Torres (13) years old, replaced him and the formation Los Ultimos Heroes was born and they released the album Los Últimos Héroes. This formation was a success. They filmed a telenovela of the same name. Future member Jonathan Montenegro acted alongside them.
Despite their newfound success, the group kept facing problems: At age 13 during a concert in Caracas, Venezuela, Angelo García left the stage because of the pain of appendicitis; a new member was chosen by Sergio's mother and he was César Abreu (13), who only lasted 7 months. Like Sergio, Abreu was in Concepto Juvenil, from 1989 to early 1990. They released another Portuguese album, Os Ultimos Herois.
Management was preparing for Sergio's departure and debuted the first non-Puerto Rican member, Adrián Olivares (13) of Mexico, who entered the group with the formation of Ruben/Robert/Rawy/Cesar/Adrian, (although Sergio was still, officially, a member) but Abreu suddenly departed just seven months in the group. Management decided to bring Sergio back in (making him the second member to be back in Menudo after Charlie Masso) for another Spanish album, No Me Corten El Pelo (Don't Cut My Hair) featuring the Sergio/Rubén/Robert/Rawy/Adrián lineup. During this time, Menudo: Edicion Brasil was renamed to Os Ultimos Herois, but Cesar's vocals were kept as the cover was changed with Adrian in it and also an additional track sung by Rawy Torres.
In November 22, 1990, two members were arrested at Miami International Airport, Sergio Blass and Ruben Gomez, ages 18 and 16, after a sniffer dog found marijuana in their pockets. It would have been acquired in Mexico while touring with Menudo. This resulted in a scandal and an expulsion from both of the members.[citation needed] In December, two new non-Puerto Rican members joined the group: Edward Aguilera (13) of Spain replaced Sergio Blass (18) (thus becoming the second European-after Fernando Salaberry-to be a member of the band) and Jonathan Montenegro (12) of Venezuela replaced Rubén Gómez (16).
At the end of 1990, with the resignation of Ruben Gomez and Sérgio Blass and the entry of the two new members, a new controversy arose: Jonathan, Edward, Rawy and Robert resigned from Menudo, alleging abuse and mistreatment.  This lineup lasted very little, from December 1990 to April 1991, and they didn't record any albums. Robert and Rawy  went on to create a separate group called Euphoria, Edward's singing career fizzled out, and Jonathan continued his acting career. [citation needed]
Adrian was the only one who remained in the group after he was approached while in Mexico and also was paid the money owed to him. The Management proposed a new lineup with a more international focus and Adrian wanting to be the oldest in the group accepted to come back.[citation needed] Edgardo Díaz left Puerto Rico and held auditions in Miami, Florida, signing Miami teens Alexis Grullón (13), Ashley Ruiz (15), and Andy Blázquez (12), and Pecos, Texas resident Abel Talamántez (12). The first album with the new lineup was Detrás De Tu Mirada, which was very successful in the whole continent, especially in Peru. From then on, the Peruvian fanbase was the most important one.[citation needed]
Menudo continued to work, releasing an English single titled ""Dancin', Movin', Shakin'"", and a follow-up in 1993, ""Cosmopolitan Girl"", on McGillis Records. They also continued to travel through Latin America. In March 1992, Menudo filmed in New York City ""The Making of Dancin, Movin, Shakin"" for Darrin McGillis Productions. In August 2012, the film was released for free viewing on YouTube.[26]
In 1992, they released 15 Años (15 Years), which would be Adrián's last album with the band, when he left in 1993. The album had hits such as ""Buscame"" and ""Lo Que Juramos"". Ricky López (13) replaced Adrián (16) and the group released their fifth Portuguese album Vem Pra Mim (Come to Me) in 1993. The next year, they released their 22nd Spanish album, Imaginate... (Imagine), with hits like ""Un Hombre Que Sabia Demas"", which is the Spanish version of ""Um Homem Que Sabia Demais"" from Skank, ""Yo Quiero Bailar Reggae"", and ""Mil Angeles"", which was dedicated to a fan, Cecilia Lopez, who died at one of their concerts in Peru the year before. 
In 1995, Ricky López (15) quit the group without warning, and again the band performed as a quartet for a few months. Ashley (19) had also decided to leave, so auditions were held and Didier Hernández (16) and Anthony Galindo (16) were chosen. Ashley's farewell concert was in Panama, where the new members were presented. In 1996, the group released their last Spanish album under the Menudo name, Tiempo De Amar (Time to Love). The album was very successful, producing several hit singles. In 1997, Andy Blázquez (18) left the group and was replaced by Daniel René Weider. A spinoff group was formed as MDO. A Spanish album was released titled MDO.
In 1998 Ricky Meléndez, René Farrait, Miguel Cancel, Johnny Lozada, Ray Reyes, and Charlie Massó re-joined to celebrate the 15th anniversary of their success in Latin America, North America, Spain, and several other countries. They planned the reunion concert to take place at Centro de Bellas Artes in the San Juan suburb of Santurce, as an experimental project. They ended up doing the shows at the much larger Coliseo Roberto Clemente in San Juan, instead. They had an unexpected success and performed as an ensemble throughout North and Latin America until August 2015, when the group disbanded due to financial issues. They named this El Reencuentro because they could not use the ""Menudo"" name.
In 2000, MDO released their album Subir Al Cielo with critical success. The album lead track ""Te Quise Olvidar"" topped the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks for several weeks. The group follow-up singles ""Sin Ti"" and ""Me Huele a Soledad"" also reached the top 10 in the U.S.. In 2002, former members Sergio, Rubén, Robert, Angelo and Rawy reunited under the name ""Los Últimos Héroes"" giving numerous concerts in Venezuela.
In early 2003, MDO officially broke up on amicable terms. The members wanted to pursue other projects. Edgardo Díaz introduced the new MDO in January 2005. In 2004, Edgardo Díaz announced that he would be bringing a new group with the Menudo formula into the music industry. Initially expecting this new group to be named Menudo, he surprised the press and general public by naming them Tick Tock.
Also in 2004, former Menudo members Roy, Raymond, Rubén, Sergio and Andy reunited under the name and banner: Menudo: La Reunion. They were based and focused primarily on a series of 'Brazilian' tours. Sergio left due to his prior commitment with ""Los Últimos Héroes"", and was replaced with Anthony Galindo. Andy would later be replaced by former MDO member Caleb Avilés before disbanding in late 2005, early 2006. In January 2005, producer Edgardo Díaz introduced the new MDO with four new members: Daniel Rodríguez, Luis Montes, Elliot Suro, and Lorenzo Duarte. The first three were among the contestants of Puerto Rican reality/talent show Objetivo Fama. This latest incarnation of the group achieved great success with their single ""Otra Vez"" which took them all across Latin America.
Also, in 2005, former Menudo members René, Johnny, Miguel, Ricky, Charlie, and Ray reunited once again to perform the songs that Menudo popularized during their era under the name and banner El Reencuentro: Momento del Adios making this their farewell tour. There were plans to bring this production to Latin America and the U.S. Also in 2005, Sergio, Angelo, Robert, Rawy and Adrián reunited again under the name Los Últimos Héroes after their successful reunion concerts in 2002.
In 2006, former Menudo: La Reunion members, Anthony and Rubén reunited and formed the duo Blacksheep and continued touring in Brazil. The duo grew a large fan base in both Brazil and Hispanic America. In 2007, a re-release of the 1992 VHS film of Menudo The making of Dancin', Movin', Shakin'"" was released on McGillis Records. Entitled Triple Threat DVD/CD Combo,[27] the box set included the Film on DVD for the first time, along with two music CDs, Latin Teen Stars and Dance Music All Night Long, featuring hit songs by Menudo, ex-Menudo members. The single, ""Dancin', Movin', Shakin'"", and ""Cosmopolitan Girl"" was released digitally on iTunes in May 2009.
In 2007, it was announced that Menudo would return after signing a multi-album contract with Sony Music. That would be directed by Johnny Wright, he was the manager of Justin Timberlake and the new band music was to be a fusion of urban, pop and rock in both English and Spanish. They began promoting the project in cities of the United States and Mexico to attract young singers who wanted to belong to a new band that would sing in Spanish and English. Auditions in different cities such as Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami, New York, among others. In the Dallas audition, radio announcer Daniel Luna and singer Luis Fonsi[28] were part of the selection jury. where they were selected JC Gonzalez[29] and Monti Montañez (Che Antonio). In New York, they took 25 boys and during this one-week mini-competency they chose 15: Monti Montañez  (Che Antonio), JC Gonzalez,[30] Carlos Pena, Jr., Anthony, Carlos Olivero, Chris Moy, Dennis, Eric, Hansel, Henry, Jorge Gabriel, Jorge Negron, José Bordonada, Monti Montañez (Che Antonio), Thomas and Trevor. The 15 semifinalists met in South Beach, Florida to continue preparing with producer Johnny Wright, choreograph Anibal Marrero and voice coach David Coury, participating through a reality show showing the entire process of competition. The re-founding of the band was profiled in a MTV reality series entitled Making Menudo that had launched as a primetime series on October 25, 2007, but was later pushed to afternoons due to low ratings.[31]  The series aired ten episodes, ending on November 20, 2007.
The members chosen in this version were: Jose Bordonada Collazo, Chris Moy, Emmanuel Vélez Pagán, Monti Montañez (Che Antonio), and Carlos Olivero. In December, a few weeks after the members of the group were chosen, their More Than Words EP was released, including four songs: ""More Than Words (A E I O U),"" ""Mas Que Amor (A E I O U),"" ""Move,"" and ""This Christmas."" Their first album was scheduled for release in autumn of 2008.
In 2009 they had a video in two versions titled: ""Lost"", in which the American actress, model and singer of Puerto Rican descent, Victoria Justice, appeared, which attracted much attention of the public towards the video. The group disbanded in early 2009.
After having internal band problems, El Reencuentro disbanded in 2015; Charlie Massó threatened to take legal action with Johnny Lozada, who had financial and managerial control of the project at the time.[32] During 2016, four members of El Reencuentro René Farrait, Charlie Massó, Ray Reyes, Miguel Cancel and joined by Robert Avellanet went back on tour, this time under the name Menudo. However the project disbanded quickly and continued with the Menudomania Forever Tour produced by In Miami Productions formed by other Menudo and MDO members from different eras, including Avellanet, Jonathan Montenegro and Rawy Torres. In 2019, Ricky Meléndez, Johnny Lozada, Miguel Cancel, Ray Reyes and René Farrait, reunited once again for the ""Súbete a Mi Moto Tour"" that kicked off at the Dunkin' Donuts Center and included dates in Latin America. It was later informed that Robert Avellanet was replacing Miguel Cancel for the remainder of the tour that is on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In September 2020, former Menudo and MDO member Anthony Galindo was found unconscious after attempting suicide. He died days later after remaining hospitalized and became the first Menudo member to pass away.[33] His family described the singer's deep depression from the prolonged shutdown of various entertainment performance venues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. His organs were donated in accordance with his last wish.[34] Longtime member Ray Reyes died April 30, 2021, of a heart attack in his childhood home in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico at 51. The group finished its last version of the ""Súbete A Mi Moto Tour"" with members Ricky Meléndez, René Farrait, Johnny Lozada and Miguel Cancel.
In April 2025, NBC was sued in Federal Court for libel to the brand name Menudo. NBC Lawsuit Story on TMZ Menudo Promoter Sues NBC
It was announced during 2022 that a new group of people, led by Mexican-American actor Mario Lopez, would launch a reboot of Menudo.  The project, named ""Menudo: A New Beginning"", held online auditions as well as ones in Miami, Florida, New York, NY, San Juan, Puerto Rico.[35] and more.
On March 20, 2023, the new members of boy band, Menudo, performed on Good Morning America.[36] The band's members were Alejandro Querales (aged 16), Ezra Gilmore (aged 14), Gabriel Rossell (aged 15), Andrés Emilio Pirela (aged 15), and Nicolas Calero (aged 12).[37] In 2024 they competed on America's Got Talent. Ezra Gilmore and Nicolas Calero have since quit the band. Gilmore and Calero were substituted by Janvier Flores and Zaulo Enchautegui.[38]

The following list names past Menudo members. Edgardo Díaz's group had a long list of members because the boys had to leave after turning a certain age, usually the age ranges from 15-18 years old when they depart (With the exception of Rene Farrait, Xavier Serbia, Ralphy Rodriguez, Angelo Garcia, Cesar Abreu, Edward Aguilera, Jonathan Montenegro, Ricky Lopez and Ashley Ruiz).

The Nintendo Switch[m] is a  video game console developed by Nintendo and released worldwide in most regions on March 3, 2017. Released in the middle of the eighth generation of home consoles, the Switch succeeded the Wii U and competed with Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One; it also competes with the ninth generation consoles, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
The Switch is a tablet that can either be docked for home console use or used as a portable device, making it a hybrid console. Its wireless Joy-Con controllers function as two halves of a standard controller and alternatively as individual controllers, featuring buttons, directional analog sticks for user input, motion sensing, and tactile feedback. A pair can attach to the sides of the console for handheld-style play, attach to a grip accessory to provide the form of a separated gamepad, or be used unattached. The Switch's system software supports online gaming through internet connectivity, as well as local wireless ad hoc connectivity with other consoles. Switch games and software are available on both physical flash-based ROM cartridges and digital distribution via Nintendo eShop; the system has no region lockout. Two hardware revisions were released: the handheld-only Switch Lite, released on September 20, 2019; and a higher-end version featuring an OLED screen, released on October 8, 2021.
The Switch was unveiled on October 20, 2016; the concept came about as Nintendo's reaction to financial losses attributed to poor sales of the Wii U and market competition from mobile games. Nintendo's then-president Satoru Iwata pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware. The Switch's design was aimed at a wide demographic of players through multiple modes of use. Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many third-party developers and publishers, as well as independent studios, to help build the Switch's game library alongside its first-party games, while standard electronic components, such as a chipset based on Nvidia's Tegra line, were chosen to make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible with existing game engines. 
Critical reception of the Switch was positive. The system received praise for its intuitive design and software library, with criticism directed toward hardware and controller issues. The Switch became a major commercial success, and has shipped over 150 million units worldwide as of December 2024[update], becoming the third-best selling console of all time behind the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS. It is also Nintendo's most successful home console to date, surpassing the Wii's 101.6 million units.
A direct successor, the Nintendo Switch 2, which is backward compatible with most Switch games, was released on June 5, 2025.
While Nintendo enjoyed record revenues, net sales, and profits in 2009 as a result of the recent releases of the Nintendo DS and Wii (in 2004 and 2006 respectively),[5][6][7] its revenues soon declined.[8][9] The company posted its first loss as a video game company in 2012 prior to the Wii U's introduction that year; Nintendo had similar losses in the following years, due to the console's poor reception.[10] The New York Times attributed Nintendo lowering financial forecasts in 2014 to weak hardware sales against mobile gaming.[11] Previously, the company was hesitant about this market, with then-president Satoru Iwata considering that to take part would cause it to ""cease to be Nintendo"" and lose its identity.[12] About three years prior to the Switch's announcement, Iwata, Tatsumi Kimishima, Genyo Takeda, and Shigeru Miyamoto crafted a strategy for revitalizing Nintendo's business model, which included approaching the mobile market, creating new hardware, and ""maximizing [its] intellectual property"".[13] Iwata was able to secure a business alliance with Japanese mobile provider DeNA before his death. The deal developed mobile games based on Nintendo's first-party franchises, believing this approach would not compromise their integrity.[14][15] Following Iwata's death in July 2015, Kimishima was named as president of Nintendo, while Miyamoto was promoted to the title of ""Creative Fellow"".[13]
The initial conception for the Switch started shortly after the release of the Wii U in 2012.[16] Kimishima stated that when Nintendo was evaluating what new hardware it wanted to produce, it ""didn't just want a successor"" to either the Nintendo 3DS or Wii U, but instead asked ""what kind of new experience can we create?""[13] In an interview with The Asahi Shimbun, Kimishima said that the Switch was designed to provide a ""new way to play"" that would ""have a larger impact than the Wii U"".[17][18] Nintendo of America president and COO Reggie Fils-Aimé emphasized the console's appeal as a device that would provide gamers the option to play at home or on the go and noted that it would enable developers to create new types of games.[19] This approach continued Nintendo's blue ocean strategy for the competitive console marketplace: rather than compete feature for feature with the other consoles, it would establish unique and difficult-to-copy devices.[20] Miyamoto said that some broad concepts of the Switch extend from the ""lateral thinking with seasoned technology"" design philosophy of Gunpei Yokoi that Nintendo has used over the last couple of decades.[21]
The commercial failure of the Wii U also pressured Nintendo to development the Switch. Early sales of the Wii U were weak compared to the Wii, prompting major third-party studios like Electronic Arts and Ubisoft to announce, near the end of the Wii U's first year, that they would not support the console. According to Fils-Aimé, when it became apparent that the Wii U's life cycle performance would underperform the company's expectations, the Switch became a ""make or break product"" for Nintendo.[22]
The design of the Switch was aimed to bridge the polarization of the gaming market at the time, creating a device that could play ""leisurely"" video games along with those intended to be played ""deeply"", according to Shinya Takahashi and Yoshiaki Koizumi, general manager and deputy general manager of Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development Division (EPD) respectively.[16] This approach also would apply to the cultural lifestyle and gaming differences between Japanese and Western players; Japanese players tend to play on the go and with social groups, while Western players tend to play at home by themselves.[23] The design of the Switch would meet both cultures, and certain games, like 1-2-Switch, could potentially make social gaming more acceptable in Western culture.[24] Two key elements that were set to address this mixed market were the ability for the unit to play either on a television screen or as a portable and the use of detachable controllers.[16] The ""Switch"" name was selected not only to refer to the console's ability to switch from handheld to home console modes, but to present ""the idea of being a 'switch' that will flip and change the way people experience entertainment in their daily lives"".[25]
Part of the inspiration of the Switch's form and design was from feedback players had given Nintendo on the Wii Remote, according to Shinya Takahashi. With the release of games like Wii Sports and Wii Fit, players had asked Nintendo if they could make the Wii Remote in a smaller form factor, potentially strapped to a part of their body. This led to Nintendo envisioning what a smaller form-factor controller could provide in both hardware and gameplay, and it led to the idea of a console that was small enough with these new controllers to also be portable.[26] Other concepts came out of critical consumer feedback of the Wii U. Fils-Aimé said that one common criticism for the Wii U was that while players did enjoy using the Wii U GamePad, it became functionless if they moved a distance away from the main console. This prompted Nintendo to design a home console that a player could take anywhere.[27] Around five different prototypes were developed for the Switch before Nintendo decided upon a finalized design. Variations included developing different methods of how the Joy-Con controllers would physically connect to the console, such as using magnets to hold them in place.[16]
In addition to the form-factor design, Nintendo needed to balance the power and speed of the console's central processing unit with battery life and the unit's size, coupled with limited development resources and deadlines set by Nintendo's management. One choice made by the development team was to use an existing system on a chip (SOC) rather than creating its own, as done on previous consoles. Koizumi said that this break from tradition was done to gain more third-party support for the console by using an SOC to which developers could easily port games. Nintendo was not focused on raw processing power but instead sought to balance the overall features of the system, including battery life and size, keeping in mind its limited development resources and timeline. Koizumi said, ""The most difficult part was on how to take an overall balance while we were getting entangled with all of those in complexity.""[16] To achieve this balance, they did not opt to use the more powerful hardware they could have used, instead using a middle-ground approach to achieve their vision of the Switch.[28]
Koizumi served as the general producer of the Switch during its development.[23] According to Miyamoto, the Switch's development within Nintendo was headed by younger employees, with him saying ""it's really been them that have put this forward and designed this system"".[29][30] Miyamoto said of the younger employees: ""I always look for designers who aren't super-passionate game fans. I make it a point to ensure they're not just a gamer, but that they have a lot of different interests and skill sets.""[30] Junior developers were also used to help brainstorm ideas of how to make sure the Switch had a longer lifecycle beyond the typical five-to-six years as most other consoles had.[31] Miyamoto, Takeda, and Iwata were less involved, but provided necessary oversight on the Switch's development principally around the cost of implementing new features that would make the Switch stand out.[21] For Miyamoto, his limited involvement allowed him to spend more time on Nintendo games being developed at the time, such as Super Mario Run.[29]
The first public news about the Switch's hardware happened alongside the announcement of Nintendo and DeNA's partnership on March 17, 2015. At this stage, Nintendo referred to the console under the codename ""NX"" and described it as a ""brand new concept"".[32] At an investor's meeting in April 2016, Nintendo announced that it planned to release the NX worldwide in March 2017.[33][34] While Nintendo did not unveil the NX's hardware at E3 2016 in June, it did announce that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which was originally announced as a Wii U-exclusive, would also be released for the NX. At a Nintendo shareholders' meeting following the conference, Miyamoto stated that the company had concerns that competitors could copy ideas from the NX if they were revealed too soon.[35][36] The following month, rumors began to surface surrounding the nature of the console, including its use of Nvidia Tegra hardware, being a ""hybrid"" device intended for both home and mobile use, controllers that could detach from the main device and be played separately, and that Nintendo would distribute games on the console via cartridges and digital downloads.[37][38][39]
On October 20, 2016, Nintendo officially announced the console under the name Nintendo Switch, alongside a trailer that demonstrated the hardware's nature as a hybrid device.[40] At the time of the trailer's release, Nintendo did not provide many details on features of the platform, though it planned to have events the following year to provide more details about the console. The company stated that there were additional features that were not presented in the introductory trailer.[41][42] Miyamoto and Fils-Aimé presented the Switch to host Jimmy Fallon on a broadcast of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in December 2016. In addition to showing more of the console's hardware and functionality, Fallon was given the opportunity to play part of Breath of the Wild live.[43]
Nintendo revealed technical details of the Switch, including its worldwide launch date and price, at a press event in Tokyo on January 13, 2017.[44] The event was livestreamed,[45] with an English voiceover provided by Nintendo of America through its broadcast and regional Twitter accounts relaying details in other languages. A Nintendo Treehouse event occurred the following day to reveal the full launch lineup and upcoming games for the Switch.[46]
The Switch was officially released on March 3, 2017 in Japan, most English-speaking and Western markets and in the United Arab Emirates.[47] It was released with an MSRP of ¥29,980 in Japan, US$299.99 in the United States, £279.99 in the United Kingdom, and A$469.95 in Australia; with pricing for the European market varying.[48][49][50] The set included a Switch console, a dock; left and right Joy-Con controllers and accompanying straps; a Joy-Con grip, an AC power adapter and an HDMI cable.[51][52] There were two Switch bundles available at launch, one with grey Joy-Con and one with neon red and blue Joy-Con.[53] Nintendo feared that a higher price would harm sales, which prompted it to not include any additional hardware or games.[54]
The Switch continued to be officially released in particular markets over the next few years, such as in Argentina on August 15, 2017,[55] and in South Korea and Taiwan on December 1.[56][57] In April 2018, CD Media, Nintendo's official distributor in Greece and the Balkans since 2016, announced after opening its new offices in Istanbul, that Nintendo's products would officially be distributed in Turkey later in the year.[58] Nintendo abruptly withdrew from the Turkish market back in June 2012 when then-distributor Nortec Eurasia closed.[59] CD Media released the Nintendo Switch in Turkey in July 2018.[60][61] Nintendo's Singapore-based distributor, Maxsoft, officially launched the Nintendo Switch in the Philippines on November 30, 2018,[62] in Thailand on March 29, 2019,[63] and in Malaysia on January 17, 2020.[64] In early-2019, Nintendo of Europe signed a partnership with Tel Aviv-based distributor TorGaming Ltd., making it Nintendo's official distributor in Israel and launched its products in the market, including the Nintendo Switch, on March 1, 2019.[65] Nintendo's Dubai-based distributor, Active Gulf, officially launched the Nintendo Switch in Oman on September 27, 2019.[66] The company had previously broken street date for the Emirati release of the console, with retailers in the region distributing it as early as February 28, 2017.[67]
Although the Nintendo Switch was not officially released in China prior to December 2019, it was widely available in the country due to grey market imports from Hong Kong and other regions, such as Japan.[68] In January 2018, former Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima said in an interview with Chinese news website QQ that Nintendo has tried to release the Switch in China, but has been unable to do so.[68][69] Nintendo partnered with Tencent in April 2019 to gain the necessary approvals to release the Switch in China, along with a test version of New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe;[70] it was released on December 10, 2019, at a base price of CN¥2,099 or about US$298.[71] Tencent continues to help Nintendo bring other Switch games through China's approval process via National Radio and Television Administration.[70] In addition, Tencent helped localize various games, and help implement the Nintendo Switch Online service within the country, integrating its offerings with the WeChat payment systems.[72]
Nintendo had exited the Brazilian market in 2015 due to high tariffs, but independent resellers sold the console there from March 2017 onward.[73] Nintendo had since assigned NC Games as its local game distributor in May 2017,[74] and the local company committed to sell some officially imported Nintendo Switch units in small quantities.[75] NC Games silently went defunct about 2019, however, and in August 2020, Nintendo affirmed that it would restart imports directly into Brazil,[76] for release on September 18, 2020.[77]
Numerous special-edition models and bundles have been released, including those for Splatoon 2,[78] the 2018 Black Friday shopping day,[79] Animal Crossing: New Horizons[80] and Fortnite.[81] The Japan-exclusive ""2nd Unit Set"" released in May 2018 on the My Nintendo Store at a reduced price of ¥24,980, was positioned towards households which already owned a Switch. It did not include a dock, AC adapter, HDMI cable, and grip.[82][83]
By February 2021, about four years from the console's release, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said that ""The Switch is in the middle of its life cycle"".[84] In July 2024, the Switch became Nintendo's longest-running console without a replacement system, surpassing the seven-year period for the NES.[85]
The Switch Lite launched on September 20, 2019, in three colors: yellow, grey, and turquoise. The system was promoted alongside The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, a remake of the 1993 Game Boy game. A special Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield branded version of the Switch Lite, themed around the Pokémon Zacian and Zamazenta, launched on November 8, 2019, a week before the game's release.[86] A coral color was released on March 20, 2020, in Japan, and on April 3 in the rest of the world.[87] A blue color released on May 7, 2021, in Europe, and on May 21 in the rest of the world.[88] A special Pokémon Dialga and Palkia limited edition was released on November 5, 2021, 14 days before the release of Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. This special edition pays homage to the Nintendo DS Lite Dialga and Palkia edition.[89] On September 26, 2024, a special gold colored edition of the Switch Lite based on The Legend of Zelda was released on September 26 to coincide with the release of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. These units also came bundled with a 12-month membership to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.[90]
Due to tariffs by the Trump administration in 2025, Nintendo increased the price of the Switch, the Switch Lite and the Switch OLED in the United States by about $50 on August 3, 2025, and stated they may be raising the prices for games, accessories and the Nintendo Switch Online subscription price in the future.[91][92]
The Nintendo Switch is a hybrid video game console that consists of a console unit, a dock, and two Joy-Con controllers.[93] Nintendo describes it as ""a home console that you can take with you on the go"".[94][95] While the company has avoided labeling the Switch as a direct successor to the Wii U or 3DS,[13] it has effectively taken over their role as Nintendo's home and handheld console.[96][97] The Wii U was discontinued shortly before the Switch's 2017 launch, while the 3DS remained in production until 2020, positioned as an entry-level option for younger players.[94][98]
The core component of the Nintendo Switch is its console, a battery-powered tablet featuring a 6.2-inch (160 mm) LCD touchscreen, measured diagonally, the same size as the Wii U GamePad.[99] It measures 173 millimeters (6.8 in) in width, 102 mm (4.0 in) in height, and 14 mm (0.55 in) in depth and weighs 297 grams (10.5 oz).[100] The screen supports 720p resolution (1280×720 px)[49] with ten-point multi-touch capacitive sensing and includes haptic technology from Immersion Corporation.[101] The unit features a 3.5 mm audio jack, stereo speakers on the bottom, a USB-C charging port, and a kickstand on the back.[102][103] Additionally, it includes a game card slot on top and a microSD card slot beneath the kickstand. Volume controls and a power button are also located on the top, while rails on the sides allow Joy-Con controllers to slide in and attach.[104] An ambient light sensor adjusts screen brightness automatically.[105] The original model number is ""HAC-001."" 
The Switch supports three gameplay modes: ""TV mode"", where the console is docked to output to a television; ""Tabletop mode"", where the kickstand allows for shared play on a flat surface; and ""Handheld mode"", where the console is used as a traditional portable device.[106][107][49] Switching between modes is seamless—users simply dock or undock the console, adjust the kickstand, and attach or detach the Joy-Con controllers.[49] Some games are designed for specific modes; for instance, Voez initially required touchscreen controls and lacked TV mode support until a 2018 update,[108][109] while Super Mario Party does not support Handheld mode.[110]
Nintendo describes the Switch as a ""single-screen experience"", displaying content either on the console when undocked or on a TV when docked. Unlike the Wii U's GamePad, it does not support dual-screen functionality.[111]
Nintendo patented a method for linking multiple Switch consoles to form a multi-monitor setup, first utilized in Super Mario Party to create an extended gameplay environment.[112][113]
The Nintendo Switch console, with or without Joy-Con attached, can be placed into the Switch dock, a docking station equipped to charge the console's battery and output video and audio to a television via HDMI.[40] The dock includes two USB 2.0 ports and one USB 3.0 port.[104] When docked, the console supports resolutions up to 1080p and a maximum frame rate of 60 frames per second, though actual resolution varies by game.[107][114][115]

The dock measures 173 millimeters (6.8 in) in width, 104 mm (4.1 in) in height, and 54 mm (2.1 in) in depth and weighs 327 grams (11.5 oz).[100][116] The version included with the OLED model features a slightly redesigned housing and replaces the rear USB port with a built-in Ethernet port for a wired internet connection.[117]The Nintendo Switch includes two controllers, collectively called Joy-Con and individually referred to as the ""Joy-Con (L)"" and ""Joy-Con (R)"".[105] These controllers attach to the console via side rails with a locking mechanism, and a small release button on the back allows for detachment. When connected to the console, the Joy-Con recharge automatically.[118] When detached, they can be used as a pair by a single player, attached to a grip accessory to mimic a traditional gamepad—which also allows charging via USB-C—or used separately as individual controllers for two players. Straps can be attached for better grip when detached,[105][107] and a charging grip powered by AA batteries is also available.[119] A single Switch console supports up to eight Joy-Con connections simultaneously.[120]
The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is a separate wireless controller that offers a more traditional design, resembling the Wii Classic Controller Pro and Wii U Pro Controller. It connects to the Switch via Bluetooth and charges through a USB-C port..[103][121][122]
The Nintendo Switch supports a wide array of additional accessories, according to Kimishima. Kimishima suggested that the Switch is part of a large ecosystem of devices, though the Switch unit remains the core console element.[123] Takahashi suggested the possibility of other units besides the Joy-Con that could attach and/or connect to the console to serve as alternate input devices and change how the Switch can be used.[23]
Nintendo offers a Joy-Con Wheel, a small steering wheel-like unit that a Joy-Con can slot into, allowing it to be used for racing games such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.[51] Standalone docks are available, which include a power adapter and HDMI cable.[51] Third parties also support the Switch with additional accessories, such as carrying cases and screen protectors.[124] The 4.0.0 system update enabled support for GameCube controllers connected via USB with the GameCube adapter that was available for the Wii U as well as a new adapter produced for the Switch; GameCube controllers can be used with most games compatible with the Switch's Pro Controller, such as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.[125][126][127][128] USB computer keyboards are supported for certain tasks, such as text entry.
In January 2018, Nintendo announced Nintendo Labo, a child-oriented platform that combines games coupled with do-it-yourself cardboard projects that attach or wrap around the Switch Console and Joy-Con, effectively creating toys around the Switch hardware to interact with games. These cardboard units, which may also include string, rubber bands, and other pieces, are referred to as Toy-Con. The game software provides instructions for the Toy-Con construction and provides the interface to control the Toy-Con. Such examples given include a remote-controlled ""car"", where the two Joy-Con attach to the car and their vibration feedback provide the motion for the car, controlled from the Switch, a fishing rod where the Joy-Con are part of the reel and handle of the rod and their motion controls used to simulate the act of fishing in the mini-game, and a small toy piano.[129]
In September 2018, with the release of Nintendo Switch Online, Nintendo introduced NES Controller style Joy-Con controllers alongside its classic games service. In September 2019, when SNES games were added to the service, wireless SNES Controllers were released. In September 2021, when Nintendo 64 games and Sega Genesis games were added to the service as part of the Expansion Pack subscription tier, wireless Nintendo 64 Controllers and Sega Genesis Control Pads were released for use with their respective services.
Nintendo released Ring Fit Adventure in October 2019, which includes a Leg Strap to mount a Joy-Con to a leg, and the Ring-Con, a flexible hard plastic ring with Joy-Con mounting. The player interacts with the game, fashioned after a console role-playing game, by doing various exercises, such as running in place, squatting, and squeezing the ring, to perform in-game actions of running, jumping, and attacking and defending, respectively.[130] Such features are part of Nintendo's ""quality of life"" goals to incorporate physical activity alongside the Switch, similar to past games like Wii Fit.[131]
In February 2017, Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima stated that it had been ""studying"" virtual reality solutions, but felt that comfort was a main concern. Nintendo of America president and COO Reggie Fils-Aimé also cited that existing VR solutions were not ""fun"" or ""social"".[132] Nintendo ultimately unveiled a new Labo VR kit in March 2019, using a cardboard headset and viewer placed in front of the console's screen, in combination with attached accessories.[133][134]
Stands and alternate docks have also been created for the Switch to overcome the limitations of the device's own kickstand for tabletop play, including an official ""Adjustable Charging Stand"" that can be connected to the device's AC adapter.[135][136]
The Switch uses a system-on-chip from the Tegra family of products, developed in partnership with Nvidia.[137][138] No specific details were revealed beyond that it is a ""custom"" Tegra chip ""based on the same architecture as the world's top-performing GeForce gaming graphics cards"" that are common in personal computers, and has a custom API known as ""NVN"", which is designed to ""bring lightweight, fast gaming to the masses"".[40][139] Takeda described the Nvidia chipset as being critical for delivering gamers a level of performance similar to that which they experience on personal computers, helping to achieve ""high performance but low power consumption"" for the Switch.[140] Pre-release reports, unconfirmed by either Nintendo or Nvidia, stated that the SoC would be a standard Nvidia Tegra X1 instead, composed of four ARM Cortex-A57 and four ARM Cortex-A53 CPU cores along with 256 Maxwell-based CUDA GPU cores.[141][142] This was later corroborated by an analysis on the console done by Tech Insights in March 2017.[143][144] The CPU cores are normally clocked at 1020 MHz, but the 8.0.0 firmware update released in April 2019 allows the CPU to clock up to 1785 MHz in certain games during loading to improve load times. While the SoC features 8 CPU cores, the Switch only uses the 4 64-bit Cortex-A57 cores, of which 1 is reserved to the operating system.[2] The GPU cores are clocked at 768 MHz when the device is docked, and in Handheld mode, fluctuating between the following speeds: 307.2 MHz, 384 MHz, and 460 MHz.[4][3] This gives the Switch's GPU a theoretical peak performance of 393 GFLOPS in TV mode and 236 GFLOPS in Handheld mode.[3] A later iFixit teardown of the final product confirmed 4 GB of LPDDR4.[145] It is clocked at 1600 MHz in TV mode, while at a reduced 1331.2 MHz in Handheld mode.[4]
The Switch offers Wi-Fi 5 (dual-band 802.11ac wireless connectivity compliant with 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac modes).[138] Up to eight Switch consoles can be connected in a wireless ad hoc network for local multiplayer games, and multiple players can play on each of the connected Switch consoles.[146][40][147] The Switch uses Bluetooth 4.1 for wireless communication between the console and its controllers.[105][138] Users can purchase a third-party USB LAN adapter for wired connectivity when the console is docked for TV mode.[138] Nintendo's Wii LAN adapter accessory is also compatible with the Switch via USB ports on the Switch dock.[148] In the case of at least one game, Splatoon 2, ten Switch consoles can use the Ethernet network to connect locally, though only eight can play directly while the other two can watch as spectators.[149]
The Switch is primarily powered in Handheld mode by a non-removable 4,310 mAh, 3.7 V Lithium-ion rechargeable battery.[104][150][151] The battery life is estimated to be between 2.5 and 6.5 hours, depending on the software being used. Nintendo gives the example of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild supporting approximately three hours of battery life.[137] The battery can be charged either while in the dock, or through a standard USB-C connector on the console.[49] The estimated recharge time while the unit is in sleep mode is about 3 hours.[114] Nintendo offers the means for replacing batteries through its customer support.[138] Each Joy-Con has its own non-removable 525 mAh, 3.7 V Lithium-ion battery separate from the console, with an estimated twenty-hour lifespan.[105] These batteries are automatically charged if they are attached to the console while it is charging itself. Additional accessories have other means to charge the Joy-Con.[118] While the basic Joy-Con grip that ships with the Switch does not offer charging capabilities, a separate premium Joy-Con grip includes a USB-C connector port that can be used to charge the Joy-Con batteries while they are connected to this grip.[152]
The Switch includes 32 GB of internal storage,[137][138] 25.9 GB of which is user-accessible.[153] This can be expanded up to 2 TB using a microSD, a microSDHC or a microSDXC card.[154][138] A microSD card slot is located under the Switch's kickstand, where a microSD card can be inserted.[155] If the microSD card is used, the Switch will only store game save data on the internal memory, leaving data that can be re-acquired on the microSD card.[156] Save data will always be stored on the console, regardless if the source is a physical game card or a digital download copy. At launch, there was no way to transfer save files to another Switch console.[157][158] Save game and profile transfers between Switch consoles were added in the 4.0.0 system update in October 2017,[159] while the 10.0.0 system update in April 2020 allowed most update data, digital games (i.e., downloaded from eShop), and other downloaded content to be swapped between the internal memory and a microSD card.[160] MicroSD and microSDHC were supported initially, and microSDXC card support was later added to the Switch's software via a system update.[114][138] SD cards and miniSD cards do not fit the Switch.[161] The Switch did not support external storage units at launch, but Nintendo stated that they were looking into adding this feature in the future.[156]
The Switch console has a 3.5 mm headphone jack. At launch, the Switch did not support Bluetooth wireless headphones, though they can also be connected if a Bluetooth adapter is connected to the headphone jack.[162][163] A system update in October 2017 partially resolved this issue by enabling support for wireless USB headphones when the receiver is connected to the USB port on the console when docked.[164][165] This was later fully resolved in a system update in September 2021 when it enabled support for Bluetooth Wireless headphone devices without the need for a USB adapter.[166]
Around July 2018, Nintendo quietly released Switch units with minor hardware changes and updated firmware to block exploits in the original Switch models that led to the ability to extract ROM images from game cards and software.[167] Nintendo claimed in its case against Team Xecuter and Gary Bowser in February that this hardware change was specifically the result of Team Xecuter's sales of modified Switch chips that used the exploit.[168]
An updated version of the Nintendo Switch under model number ""HAC-001(-01)"" was announced on July 17, 2019, and was released in Japan and North America in mid-August 2019, and in the United Kingdom in September 2019. This revision uses the Tegra X1+ SoC, a more efficient chipset compared to the Tegra X1 used in the original model. Thus, the time-on-battery was effectively extended to 4.5–9 hours, depending on the game being played. No other system component was updated in this revision.[169][170][171][172][173]
The Nintendo Switch is produced between Taiwan-based Foxconn and Japan-based Hosiden, with Foxconn accounting for the largest volume.[174] Nintendo did not plan to sell the Switch below manufacturing cost at launch,[175] as they had done for both the 3DS and Wii U at their respective launches;[176] Nintendo affirmed that the Switch would be profitable from launch during its 2016 fiscal year earnings report, as the company saw the console as a key earnings driver for 2017 and beyond.[177] Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, a Japanese product teardown firm, estimated that the Switch cost $257 to make compared to its $299 MSRP, with the console and dock at $167 while each Joy-Con costs $45.[178] Kimishima said that they may be able to see further profitability on the Switch when they can achieve volume discounts on components once they reach a level of about 10 million Switch units.[179]
Prior to launch, Nintendo anticipated shipping two million Nintendo Switch units by the end of the console's first month, and assured that its supply chain would be able to meet demand following the launch period to avoid the shortage situation with the NES Classic Edition in late 2016.[180][94][181] Kimishima anticipated that the Switch will have lifetime sales numbers similar to the Wii, which sold 101 million units by 2016.[98]
Following the initial sales report numbers in April 2017, the Financial Times reported that the company was seeking to produce 18 million Switch units in its 2017 financial year as to avoid ""customer tantrums"" with poor supply levels, particularly near the 2017 holiday season and the release of Super Mario Odyssey on October 27, 2017.[182] Fils-Aimé said in September 2017 that their 2017 production target for the Switch could be hampered by bottlenecks in individual components.[183][184] DigiTimes reported in October 2017 that Nintendo had further shifted the production rate for the Switch up to 2 million per month, with plans to ship 20 million units by the end of the year; the newspaper also stated that the production rate was limited by component availability, and not by other factors of Nintendo's production process.[174]
On the presentation of the 2017 fiscal year results to investors, Nintendo's newly named president Shuntaro Furukawa stated that they anticipate producing 20 million Switch consoles over the 2018 fiscal year keeping the momentum of its sales in that year.[185]
In June 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that Nintendo was starting to move some of its production of the Switch and two hardware revisions of the Switch outside of China and into Southeast Asia to limit the impact of new United States tariffs on electronics made in China.[186][187]
In November 2020, Bloomberg reported that Nintendo asked its assembly partners to boost production of the Switch by 20% and raised its target goal of Switch sales for the 2020 fiscal year from 25 million units sold to 30 million units, having previously reportedly raised their target for the fiscal year from 22 million units sold to 25 million units in August 2020.[188][189] These boosts in production have been attributed to more demand mainly due to the success of Animal Crossing: New Horizons during the COVID-19 pandemic.[188][189]
The Nintendo Switch Lite is a revision of the Switch designed for handheld play released worldwide on September 20, 2019, with an MSRP of US$199.99.[190] First announced in July 2019, the Switch Lite is a single unit, integrating the Joy-Con as part of the main unit's hardware, and uses a smaller screen measuring 5.5 inches (14 cm) diagonally. Additionally, a regular directional pad replaces the four directional buttons on the integrated left Joy-Con. While using a smaller battery than the original Switch, the Switch Lite uses a more power-efficient chipset, the 16-nanometer Tegra X1+, to extend the estimated use time from 2.5 to 6.5 hours to 3–7 hours on a single battery charge.[169]
According to The Wall Street Journal, Nintendo's goal with the Switch Lite was to produce a sub US$200 unit, aimed at casual gamers, to compete with gaming services that do not require a dedicated device. To achieve this, Nintendo negotiated on reduced prices from its component suppliers. Further, the Journal stated that Nintendo had gained Murata Manufacturing as a battery supplier in addition to TDK, to lower costs by causing competition between the two companies.[190] The Switch Lite is physically larger than previous Nintendo handhelds: its display is 0.62 inches (1.6 cm) larger and the unit measures 1.9 inches (4.8 cm) longer when compared to a New Nintendo 3DS XL, which itself was the large-sized model in the Nintendo 3DS line.[191]
The Switch Lite normally only supports games that can be played in handheld mode, retaining features like the Switch's gyroscopic sensors, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and NFC compatibility. Some tabletop games that require the HD Rumble or IR camera features, such as 1-2-Switch, require players to use separate Joy-Con controllers with the Switch Lite. The system does not support any docking or connectivity to a television and is thus incompatible with games that require television mode. Players who attempt to purchase games that require television or tabletop mode via the eShop on the Switch Lite will be notified of the incompatibility. Though not included with the system, the Switch Lite does support external controllers otherwise compatible with standard Switch models, such as standalone Joy-Con controllers, though they cannot be docked to the system.[192][193] Some controllers, such as GameCube controllers, work with the system, but require extra adapters, as the normal GameCube to Switch adapter uses the USB ports on the full-size Switch's dock.[194][195]
On July 6, 2021, Nintendo officially announced a new model called the Nintendo Switch – OLED Model. The OLED model features a 7-inch (180 mm) 720p OLED display, and when docked, outputs to 1080p resolution similar to the original model. Additionally, it features 64 GB of internal storage, enhanced audio functions, a magnesium alloy body and a wider adjustable stand for use in tabletop mode. The unit ships with a new dock that includes a wired LAN port.[117] It features similar technical specifications as the base Switch model, and is compatible with all Switch games and existing accessories.[196] The unit ships in two bundles: one that includes a black dock and a red and blue Joy-Con (similar to the base model's default color scheme), and one that includes a white dock and a white Joy-Con. It was released on October 8, 2021, alongside the release of Metroid Dread, with a retail price of $349.99.[117]
Ahead of the release of the OLED version on September 13, 2021, Nintendo reduced the base price of the original Switch model in Europe from €329.99 to €299.99, and in the UK from £279.99 to £259.99, which Nintendo said also reflected changes in currency exchange rates.[197] All other regions – including North America and Australia – did not receive a price cut.[198] Four special-edition models were released: those for Splatoon 3,[199] Pokémon Scarlet and Violet,[200] The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,[201] and a ""Mario Red Edition"" to tie into Super Mario Bros. Wonder.[202]
In early 2019, reports from The Wall Street Journal and The Nikkei claimed that Nintendo had plans for two new models of the Nintendo Switch. One new model was a lightweight revision, later revealed as the Nintendo Switch Lite; the other was to be a more powerful console to be released in 2020.[203][204] A notification from Nintendo alerting the Federal Communications Commission of changes to the Switch's hardware in July 2019 were used as further evidence for a new model.[205] DigiTimes later corroborated previous reports, claiming Nintendo planned to release a model with an improved CPU and magnesium alloy body in the second half of 2020[205]—in December 2019, Nintendo denied any intent to release a new model in 2020,[206] and the global chip shortage beginning in 2020 impacted console production regardless.[207] Bloomberg continued to state Nintendo was preparing to release a higher-end Nintendo Switch model with an OLED screen and the ability to output a 4K resolution, and the model would release in late 2021.[208][209][210][211] However, Nintendo announced the Nintendo Switch OLED model in July 2021.[212][117] Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser said that Nintendo aims to use technology to enhance gameplay, and does not create ""technology for technology's sake"".[213] Bloomberg again stated that a higher-end Switch was in development, and other upgrades were scrapped in favor of only the OLED screen in light of the chip shortage.[214] In response, Nintendo said that the report was ""not true"" and made false claims about the company.[215] Zynga—one company named by Bloomberg as having received a development kit of an upgraded Nintendo Switch model—also denied the factuality of the report.[215] Continued rumors of a high-end model were fueled by a leak of Nvidia's source code showing a custom chip with DLSS support made for Nintendo.[216] In December 2022, Digital Foundry claimed that any upgraded Nintendo Switch model was no longer in development, and that Nintendo instead was focusing on the system's successor, which was later revealed to be the Nintendo Switch 2.[217]
The Nintendo Switch runs a proprietary operating system named Horizon, built on a microkernel architecture.[218] The Switch's user interface features tile-based access to games that are either present in the game card slot or stored within the unit's storage devices. It includes quick access buttons for a News feed from Nintendo, eShop access, and a photo album for screenshots captured during gameplay;[114] the 4.0 update to the software in October 2017 also enabled capturing and sharing video from select games.[159] A single Switch console supports up to eight user profiles, which each can be tied to a Nintendo Account user ID.[156] At launch, profiles could be represented by either a pre-made avatar from an internal gallery, or by using a Mii. Compared to previous Nintendo consoles, the Nintendo Switch's Mii editor allowed for a wider variety of color options for aspects such as hairstyles, and was implemented into the system settings instead of being an independent application.[219][156][220][221] On February 28, 2022, Nintendo launched a ""Missions and Rewards"" system for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, allowing them to complete missions set by the application (like backing up save data or playing Game Trials software) to earn Platinum Points which can be spent on various icon parts from different Nintendo games and franchises. Icon parts of a specific game (like backgrounds, borders and characters) can then be combined to create an icon.[222]
Prior to the 4.0 update, players discovered that the Switch's firmware included an Easter egg allowing players to play the NES Golf game via a built-in emulator. While Nintendo has not confirmed its presence, journalists and players believed this to be a tribute to Nintendo's former president Satoru Iwata; Golf was programmed by Iwata, and the game could only be accessed if the system clock was set to July 11 – the day Iwata died in 2015 – and the Joy-Con are moved similarly to how Iwata would move his hands in his Nintendo Direct presentations. Some Japanese users referred to this as an omamori (charm) left by Iwata himself.[223] With the 4.0 update, the executable code for this Easter egg appears to have been wiped by Nintendo.[224]
In August 2018, a Twitter user found files on the Switch's firmware while reverse-engineering the console, which suggested that Nintendo was possibly testing VR functionality for the Switch. The Twitter user was able to activate the hidden ""VR Mode"", which split the screen into two displays.[225][226] Hackers found that the code related to possible VR functionality had been hidden in the Switch firmware for over a year.[226]
Nintendo continued its white hat security program that it had with the Nintendo 3DS. With the help of third-party website HackerOne, Nintendo will award up to $20,000 to the first user to identify any vulnerability that impacts piracy, cheating, or the potential sending of inappropriate content to younger users, the amount based on the severity of the security flaw.[227]
In April 2018, two separate groups discovered a method to use an exploit chain in the Tegra chip system that can be used to boot other software on the Switch. The exploit could not be patched through a software update, as the BootROM of the Tegra X1 cannot be modified after the chip leaves the factory. Both groups had notified Nvidia and Nintendo of the exploit before publicly announcing their findings.[228] Users studying the hardware determined that Nintendo has the capacity to permanently ban specific Switch consoles used to obtain software via this exploit from the Nintendo Network, as the Switch console includes a unique device identification code used as part of the validation to the Network. As games downloaded from the Nintendo Network include encrypted information that ties the Nintendo ID to the console, which is transmitted to Nintendo when users start playing games, Nintendo can track unapproved software downloads and take action.[229] Nintendo has reportedly fixed the vulnerability in newer Switch units as of July 2018.[230]
In June 2018, two hackers found a way to run the Switch system's developer software menu on non-developer Switch units, allowing users to directly load games onto SD cards or create custom avatars for their user profile, including pornographic and NSFW pictures, which violate Nintendo's terms of service. A Nintendo spokesperson responded to Kotaku's article on the topic, saying that ""Modified Nintendo Switch systems have been banned"".[231]
Shortly after the release of Nintendo Switch Online in September 2018, hackers and modders were able to figure out how to run unauthorized ROMs on the Nintendo Switch NES emulator. A Switch hacker who goes by the name DevRin, was the first to discover the hack and posted his findings on YouTube, which prompted a modder who goes by the name KapuccinoHeck to investigate the matter with two others and their findings were later posted on KapuccinoHeck's Twitter account.[232][233]
Nintendo Switch user profiles can be linked to a Nintendo Account, which enables access to online features and the ability to download and purchase software from Nintendo eShop. A Nintendo Account can be created with an account from a third-party social networking service or an existing Nintendo Network ID from a 3DS or Wii U. Nintendo does not plan to offer first-party social networking services on Switch, such as Miiverse or StreetPass, the latter owing to Nintendo's promotion of Switch as primarily being a home console. Instead, profiles could be linked to existing social networks such as Facebook and X (then Twitter) for social and sharing features, though integration with X has since been removed.[234][235][236][237]
Players can register friends through Friend Codes as with previous Nintendo systems, searching for friends in the local network, through past multiplayer interactions, or through Nintendo Account profiles registered as friends on Nintendo mobile apps such as Mario Kart Tour and Super Mario Run.[238] In March 2017, Nintendo said that they had plans to provide other methods for registering friends, including through third-party social media and via Nintendo Network IDs.[239] Support for registering friends on the Switch via Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) was added on March 13, 2018, as part of the 5.0.0 system update.[240] The Switch has no native support for Nintendo Network IDs, but users can link their Nintendo Network ID credentials to a Nintendo Account profile, which enables the ability to add friends that they had already registered on their 3DS or Wii U, and share an eShop balance between all three platforms.[241]
In line with Microsoft and Sony consoles, a subscription is required to access online multiplayer in most games.[242][243] The Nintendo Switch Online subscription includes access to online play, voice chat, access to an ongoing Nintendo Classics library of Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), and Game Boy games, cloud storage for save data on supported games, as well as other special offers and promotions.[244][245][246][247] A premium expansion pack subscription tier was launched in October 2021, which added support for Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis games to Nintendo Classics,[248] followed by Game Boy Advance (GBA) games in February 2023.[249] The expansion pack also includes access to some paid downloadable content, including the Mario Kart 8 Booster Course Pack, Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons Happy Home Paradise.[250] Free-to-play games such as Fortnite Battle Royale and Warframe are exempt from the subscription requirement for online play.[251][252][253][254]
The Nintendo Switch Online mobile app allows access to voice chat for Switch Online subscribers, as well as access to game-specific microsites. Unlike its competitors, voice chat is not supported via the console itself, requiring use of the app on a smartphone instead.[24][255] A separate app provides access to parental controls for the console.[242][256]
The Switch did not launch with any multimedia-oriented features, such as a web browser,[o] messaging system or support for video streaming services.[257][failed verification] Fils-Aimé said that because the Switch is geared as a gaming console that is far different from what their competitors offer, they had focused on achieving that goal first and foremost, and did not see media support as a differentiator from their competitors.[258]
Niconico, a popular Japanese video service, launched for the Switch in Japan on July 13, 2017, and was the Switch's first third-party media app in any market.[259] Hulu was the first video streaming application released for the Switch in the United States on November 9, 2017.[260] A YouTube application was released on November 8, 2018.[261] Fils-Aimé said in June 2018 that conversations to bring Netflix to the Switch were ""on-going"",[262] though as of 2025 Netflix is not available on the Switch. On November 4, 2020, a trial version app of the Tencent Video streaming service was launched exclusively for Nintendo Switch consoles officially distributed by Tencent in mainland China. An official version app will be launched at a later date.[263] Funimation launched their own streaming app for the Nintendo Switch, featuring a reworked layout and new functions. The app became available via eShop in the United States and Canada on December 15, 2020, and launched in various other countries at later dates,[264] such as the United Kingdom and Ireland on March 22, 2021.[265] A version of the Twitch app launched for the Nintendo Switch on November 11, 2021, in most regions worldwide. The eShop version of the app allowed users to watch or follow any live or recorded content on Twitch, but did not support any native ability for Switch players to contribute content.[266] The app was discontinued in January 2024.[267]
Korg Gadget, a music production app, was released for the Nintendo Switch on April 26, 2018.[268] InkyPen, a comics and manga subscription app, launched exclusively on the Switch worldwide on December 17, 2018.[269] Izneo, another comics and manga subscription service, was released for the Switch on February 28, 2019.[270] FUZE4, a text-based programming language app, was released in August 2019.[271][non-primary source needed]
Games for the Nintendo Switch can be obtained through either retail channels or digitally through the Nintendo eShop. Games distributed at retail are stored on proprietary cartridges, similar in design to the game cards used for Nintendo 3DS games, albeit smaller and thinner.[272] As the world's first major hybrid console, the console is the first major home-playable video game system to make use of cartridges since the Nintendo 64. Due to their small size at 31 by 21 by 3 millimetres (1.22 in × 0.83 in × 0.12 in),[273] Nintendo coats each cartridge with denatonium benzoate, a non-toxic bitterant used to discourage children from ingesting them.[274] Nintendo offered a suggested retail price for Switch games at the console's launch of US$60, equivalent to the price for new games on either the Xbox One and PlayStation 4.[275] Nintendo otherwise allows publishers to set the price for a game, only requiring the list price be the same for physical and digital releases, if a physical release is made. This has caused some games also available on other consoles to be priced higher on the Switch due to the costs of manufacturing the game card for the Switch version.[276][277] Online media outlets have colloquially referred to this price hike as the ""Switch tax"".[278][279][277] The ""Switch tax"" also applies to many games that had been previously released on other platforms ported later to the Switch, where the Switch game price reflects the original price of the game when it was first released rather than its current price. As of August 2018[update], it is estimated that the cost of Switch games is an average of 10% over other formats.[280]
Game cards at the time of the Switch's release had a 32 GB capacity; Nintendo had planned to introduce 64 GB game cards by the second half of 2018, but had to push this back.[281] Some physical games may still require content to be installed to internal storage, with some games using a significant portion of the internal memory if a microSD card is not available.[282] Other physical games which have a large amount of content may require a microSD card to be present in the Switch, such as NBA 2K18; such games are clearly marked on the cover to show these requirements.[283]
The Switch supports the ability for cloud gaming to run games that require more hardware capabilities than the Switch allows, running these games over a network with the game computations performed on server hardware. These games may be tied to specific regions due to purchasing options. Early examples of such games on the Switch include Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Phantasy Star Online 2 and Assassin's Creed: Odyssey which were primarily limited to Japanese releases,[284] while more recently Control and Hitman 3 will be offered through cloud gaming worldwide in 2020 and beyond.[285]
Unlike previous Nintendo home consoles, the Switch is region-free. This allows players to use cartridges or downloaded content from any part of the world, with the exception of Chinese game content which can only be played on Switch units manufactured for that country.[286] Nintendo recommends using the appropriate regional eShop for digital purposes for obtaining the best post-purchase support if needed.[107][156] Nintendo opted to go region-free to reduce the amount of workload and cost to both themselves and developers in having to manage two or more regional certification processes and different ROM cartridge production pathways for those regions.[287] Further, eShop purchases, while still tied to the Nintendo Account, are not tied to the specific Switch console, as was the case for previous Nintendo hardware. Once the user re-registers their account to a Switch, they have access to download all previous purchases; however, a user can only have their account registered on one console at a time, and downloaded software tied to an account cannot be used if that account is not registered to the device.[241] With the console's 6.0.0 system update, alongside the launch of the Online service in September 2018, a user can play games that they have purchased from the eShop on a second Switch console, though requiring continuous online connection and other restrictions.[288]
The Switch does not use optical discs, and as such does not have native backward compatibility with software from any previous Nintendo console.[289] The Switch is also not backward compatible with other digital games from previous consoles.[156]
Emulated versions of games from previous Nintendo systems are offered through eShop and the Nintendo Switch Online service, although the blanket Virtual Console brand used for these releases on Wii, Wii U, and 3DS has been dropped in favor of Nintendo Classics.[290][291] In February 2017, Kimishima said that the Switch is powerful enough to emulate games from previous Nintendo consoles.[24]
One of the generally perceived failures of the Wii U was a lack of support from third-party developers, leading to a weak library of games.[292] Nintendo was more aggressive in trying to bring on third-party developers, early in the Switch's development, to ensure a stronger lineup of games. Takahashi and Koizumi reached out to many of the third-parties directly to help gain their support early on.[23] Electronic Arts' executive Patrick Söderlund said that Nintendo had taken a different track with attracting third-party developers to the Switch and have engaged Electronic Arts and other major developers throughout the development of the Switch, listening to their input, to help make the Switch more successful.[293]
Nintendo also began gaining support of independent video game developers in the middle of 2016 to provide assistance to help them bring games to the Switch, led by Nintendo's head of partner management Damon Baker.[294] They had tried to draw in indie developers near the end of the Wii U's lifetime, providing indie game demos that were highlighted during E3 2015, but by this point, the Wii U had already been considered a failure.[294] Nintendo sees games such as Snipperclips as a model of their target for indie games, in which they worked to help provide Switch implementation support and software tools to these parties early in the console's lifecycle, according to Takahashi and Koizumi.[23] Some, like Yacht Club Games, who have ported Shovel Knight to the Switch, noted that some of the major innovations in the Switch, such as the Joy-Con, were not revealed to them until just prior to the January 2017 announcement.[295] Nintendo of America reached out to many independent developers and publishers, including Chucklefish, Team17, and Devolver Digital, to gain games for the platform and make the process of publishing easier. Nintendo still curates which games they allow on the system, using the company's past portfolio for evaluation, and still carefully time releases to keep a steady stream of new content. However, once a game is greenlit, pushing out patches and updates can be done rapidly and at no further cost to the developer.[296][297] Nintendo also offers the Switch's dev kit at 50,000 yen, or about $450, far under the cost of a comparable dev kit for other consoles, making it more amenable for smaller developers to afford and build for the unit.[298] Nintendo offers several of these indie games as ""Nindies"" through the eShop. Nintendo had anticipated that they would have at least sixty indie games released for the Switch through 2017, but ended up with over 320 games by the end of 2017 as a result of the console's popularity.[299][300][301] Indie developers have found that Nintendo has also had a significant role in the promotion and marketing of their games, including using the games to help promote the Switch itself, in contrast to Microsoft or Sony. These developers also found Nintendo tries to keep a better rapport with fans of Nintendo's products, and help these fans identify Switch indie games they feel they will like the most, including those games that build on Nintendo's classic games from the NES, SNES, and Game Boy eras that can draw in a more global audience.[294] Baker says that while they do try to encourage indie developers to release their games as a Switch console exclusive, they do not force developers towards this, knowing that the developers must have a good business case for doing so.[294]
While many independent developers have praised Nintendo for better support for the Switch, others, speaking anonymously through Nintendo Life, noted that Nintendo seemed to have a ""walled garden"" approach with independent developers, a remnant from the WiiWare program that allowed a great deal of shovelware to be pushed onto it. These anonymous developers found that Nintendo was either eschewing some developers completely, or requiring them to have a well-known publishing partner or an inside person within Nintendo to be able to gain the rights to publish for the Switch.[302][303] Baker said that they encourage self-publishing, but do also place value on trust of established partners for their recommendations of what games would be best for the Switch.[287] Another factor limiting Nintendo is the availability of dev kits and other hardware at the start of the console's life. However, Baker does anticipate that Nintendo will be much more open in the future, once they have addressed the necessary issues for curation and discovery of games via the eShop.[301]
During its official unveiling in October 2016, Nintendo deliberately opted not to provide a list of games for the system, as they ""want people to touch the device in January [2017] and experience the software for themselves"", according to Kimishima.[123] Instead, Nintendo announced some of the partners that had committed to supporting the Switch; contrasting Nintendo's struggles to gain third-party support on-launch for previous platforms, the company initially listed 48 third-party publishers, studios, and middleware developers.[40] Among these partners, Nintendo listed major publishers such as Activision, Bethesda, Electronic Arts, Sega, Square Enix, Take-Two Interactive, and Ubisoft.[40][304][305]
Nintendo had previously relied more on providing its own internally developed tools and libraries that third-party developers would use to develop games for earlier systems. With the Switch, the company went a different route. According to Takahashi, ""we have been aiming to realize an environment in which a variety of different third-party developers are able to easily develop compatible software"", taking advantage of the Nvidia chipset's support for many standard libraries that allows for ease of transition from other platforms to the Switch.[306] Unity Technologies, Epic Games, and the Khronos Group pledged support to help developers bring games to the Switch using their game engines and middleware, Unity, Unreal Engine 4, and the Vulkan and OpenGL graphical APIs, respectively;[307][308][309] for instance, the Unreal Engine toolkit was updated in February 2017 to provide beta testing for native support for Switch games, with full support added by May 2017.[310][311] In March 2018, Nintendo announced it had also gained support of YoYo Games' GameMaker Studio 2 engine for the Switch.[312] Miyamoto said that Nintendo's own developers have ""mastered"" engines like Unreal, so that while it would be unlikely that Nintendo would release a first-party game using such software, they can help support developers using these tools on the Switch.[306] Several indie developers who have previously worked on Nintendo's consoles said that the Switch was ""the least demanding Nintendo console"" they have developed.[313][294]
In addition to these third-party middleware solutions, Nintendo developed its own NintendoWare Bezel Engine for first- and third-party developers, first announced in 2018, aimed ""to provide an environment that can create interesting games in a short period of time while keeping development costs as low as possible"". Games like Tetris 99 and Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics were developed in this engine.[314][315]
By 2022, the Switch was generally considered to have reversed the trend of flagging third party support for Nintendo consoles and game platforms, something that was attributed to Nintendo having made concerted outreach efforts towards third parties to bring them on board.[316][317] Positive analyses of the Switch's impact on Nintendo's third party relations were, however, frequently laced with the caveat that Nintendo would have to work to transition their third party support from the Switch to the Switch's successor properly, something they had routinely failed at in the past.[317]
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, originally announced as a Wii U exclusive, was released for the Switch as a launch game.[35][318][319] The console's reveal trailer showcased footage from new games in Nintendo franchises, including Super Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Splatoon 2, as well as footage from NBA 2K18 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.[320] Although Nintendo and third-parties stated at that time that these were not necessarily representative of Switch games,[321][322][323] all five were confirmed as Switch releases during the January 2017 press events.[49] Ultimately, the system launched with:[p] 1-2-Switch, Arcade Archives, Fast RMX, I am Setsuna, Just Dance 2017, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, New Frontier Days: Founding Pioneers, Othello, Skylanders: Imaginators, Snipperclips, Super Bomberman R, Voez, and Vroom in the Night Sky.[324]
The Switch did not launch with any bundled games or have any pre-loaded games or game demos; Fils-Aimé stated that once they had decided on the price point and evaluated the forthcoming game lineup, they opted to allow consumers to choose which games to get rather than include one in the bundle and increase its price.[54][325] At least ten games were shipped or digitally available alongside the Switch in time for its North American launch, including Nintendo's first-party games The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and 1-2-Switch.
Fils-Aimé said that Nintendo planned a ""steady cadence of content"" for the Switch after launch, avoiding the perceived situation with gaps between major releases for Wii U software.[326] Kimishima said that Nintendo scheduled its first-party releases ""to continue to provide new titles regularly without long gaps"", as this ""encourages consumers to continue actively playing the system, maintains buzz, and spurs continued sales momentum for Nintendo Switch.""[181] Journalists noted that Nintendo appeared to be pledged to this approach following their schedule of planned releases of first-party games for the Switch as announced during E3 2017, with a new game roughly every month into early 2018.[327] 2023 was a record-breaking year for the Nintendo Switch, with 2,360 games released.[328]
In a Nintendo Direct livestream at the end of March 2025, Nintendo announced that the Switch consoles — including the original Switch and its successor – will support Virtual Game Cards. With this feature, users own a physical key, thereby gaining the right to activate the digitally encrypted software and transfer games between consoles. Virtual Game Cards can also be loaned to other users within a Nintendo Switch Online Family account for two weeks, after which they automatically return to their original owner. The feature was activated via a system update on April 29, 2025.[329]
A key part of marketing the Switch was to be ""crystal clear in our communication of what the product was and what the product could do"", according to Fils-Aimé, so as to avoid similar issues with how they presented the Wii U.[330][327][331] While the Wii U was designed as a home console unit, Nintendo's lack of clarity on this point led to a general assumption that the unit, principally the Wii U GamePad, was more like a tablet, overshadowing the Wii U's other features (such as dual-screen play modes). Nintendo also believed that some consumers had mistaken the Wii U GamePad as being an accessory for the existing Wii console, rather than being the flagship feature of an entirely new platform.[332] Instead, for the Switch, Fils-Aimé said the company was ""very aggressive and clearly communicating the proposition that it's a home console you can take on the go wherever and whenever you want"".[330]
For example, the October 2016 trailer (considered significantly unlike Nintendo's past marketing efforts, according to Bloomberg[13]) was designed to show the various ways that the Switch can be used so that viewers would recognize that ""each of its forms offer different play experiences for people to enjoy"".[25] Kimishima said that the intent of the trailer was to show that the device was aimed across all player demographics, showcasing features that core gamers would recognize and appreciate to carry this intent.[13] A large amount of Nintendo's launch marketing for the console focused heavily on the launch game Breath of the Wild; Nintendo of America marketing executive, Nick Chavez, stated that the decision to showcase the new Zelda game was meant to promote it to both older viewers, who may have grown up with the franchise's earliest games and are accustomed to modern open world games, and to a new generation of players.[333]
Nintendo aired its first-ever Super Bowl ad during the United States broadcast of Super Bowl LI. Set to the Imagine Dragons song ""Believer"",[334] the ad showcased the various play modes with the Switch and its launch games, particularly Breath of the Wild, and upcoming releases; while an ad to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Pokémon was broadcast the previous year during Super Bowl 50, this ad was paid for by The Pokémon Company and not by Nintendo.[335][336][337] Chavez said of the ad, ""There's no bigger stage in the U.S. on which to showcase the platform. I think it speaks to our confidence in the system.""[333]
Additional television commercials followed the Super Bowl spot, which were to demonstrate Switch's use cases among different demographics, as well as ""casual"" and ""core"" gaming audiences.[333] Such ad venues included the 2017 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the 2017 Kids' Choice Awards, and on programming blocks for Nickelodeon, Adult Swim, and Comedy Central.[334] Chavez emphasized that Nintendo's overall marketing for Switch was not be ""just a six to eight week launch campaign"", but ""really a 15-month campaign for us, to say nothing of our plans for 2018"".[333]
In addition to advertising, Nintendo had planned several ways for players to try the system before its release through various ""sampling events"". Kimishima felt that it was important, particularly for ""career gamers"", for Nintendo to get the Switch into players' hands, so that players could understand how the system differs from Nintendo's previous offerings. Kimishima also said that the company was ""running a guerrilla marketing program where we're just dashing around and trying to have as many events as possible and get it in the hands of players so they can experience the difference.""[24]
The North American and European press had special events on January 13, 2017, following the Tokyo presentation.[338][339] Various Switch demonstration events were run in North America, Europe, and Japan during January and February 2017.[340][341][342] Nintendo offered demonstrations of the Switch at gaming conferences including PAX South, South by Southwest, and RTX.[343][344][345] Nintendo also promoted the Switch through an ""Unexpected Places"" campaign in February 2017, temporarily setting up living-room-style spaces in three United States locations and inviting fans and players, including John Cena, to try out the unit.[346]
In June 2018, Nintendo announced it was partnering with Disney Channel to help produce Nintendo Switch Family Showdown, a televised competition where families competed in challenges around various Switch games in August 2018.[347]
Market analysts had a mixed response to the October 2016 announcement of the Nintendo Switch.[41][42] Some expressed concern that the Switch failed to address the issues that led to poor Wii U sales, and was aimed at a small audience.[41] Others were more upbeat, believing the Switch approach would fit in well in the Japanese market, where space for dedicated consoles and televisions are limited, and transition into Western ones.[19][348] Stock research analyst John Taylor also approved of the company's decision to introduce the console prior to the holiday season, when Microsoft and Sony would attempt to attract casual gamers to their consoles.[19][349]
Following the January 2017 press conference revealing the unit's pricing and release date, journalists expressed concern at the apparently high system price, comparable to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles but lacking some of their capabilities, the cost of the paid-for Nintendo Switch Online service, and the small number of games that were confirmed for launch.[48][350][351][352] However, other analysts found that the pricing factors indicated the Switch was a more robust console, and would likely sell better than the Wii U, with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild being a key sales driver.[350] These analysts also figured the Switch fills an appropriate gap in hardware for those seeking more complex gameplay that is not offered in tablet and mobile gaming but who did not need to purchase a powerful ""boxy"" console.[353] Most analysts agreed that the success of the Switch depends on Nintendo's support and avoiding mistakes the company had made in marketing and promoting the Wii U.[353]
Nintendo investors showed wariness at the Switch, as its stock price dropped in the months from the system's announcement up until its release. Analysts believed investors felt the Switch was very risky and were unsure if the unit would draw new audiences to Nintendo.[354][41][355][356][357] Analysis firms estimated the Switch would have a slow start due to the risk of the system and high price, but could still clear up to 40 million units by 2020.[358][359]
Game and hardware developers were more positive towards the Switch, seeing the system as ""a more unifying experience between their handheld and console divisions"", but expressed concern on unanswered hardware specifications, and how Nintendo would market the unit to draw in developers.[360][361][362][363] Developer Hideo Kojima compared the notion of the Switch to his idea of ""transfarring"" that he presented in 2011, allowing players to take a game from a home platform to a portable one, which became the basis of Sony's cross-buy program. He said that the Switch was ""an extension of that idea. The fact you can play something at home and take it outside, this is the gamer's dream. The Switch is an evolution of that.""[364] Bethesda's Todd Howard stated, ""I think Nintendo is the only company that could pull something like this off"", commenting on the Nintendo Switch's design and functionality.[365] Phil Spencer, head of Microsoft's Xbox division, said he was impressed with Nintendo's ability to ""state a bold vision and build a product that delivers on that vision"".[366]
Retailers were also generally positive with the Switch; GameStop CEO Paul Reines stated the unit was transformative in the market and would be a ""game-changer"" that could ""expand the audience for gaming"".[367] Pre-orders were high, with Kimishima stating before launch that total pre-orders reached nearly the levels of units they had ready to ship for launch.[24][368][369]
The October 2016 reveal trailer became Nintendo of America's most-viewed video on YouTube within 24 hours, and was the top trending video on YouTube for about a day.[370]
Upon release, the Switch was praised by reviewers for having a lot of potential, but they were underwhelmed by the limited number of games available at launch that did not show the full extent of the console's abilities. Reviewers also noted that the initial operating software and features were limited and included software bugs that, while likely to be fixed in time, marred the experience of the system.[371] Even with the day-one update, there were numerous reports of hardware problems, in particular the Bluetooth connectivity of the Switch console with the Joy-Con (L) controller, and ease with which the console screen could be scratched.[372] About a week after release, Fils-Aimé said the company is in ""fact-finding mode"" to try to diagnose these issues.[373] In late March, Nintendo reported that the Joy-Con (L) desync issue was a ""manufacturing variation"" on a small number of the units, which could be easily fixed; as noted by CNET's Sean Hollister, Nintendo repaired affected controllers by placing a bit of conductive foam near the antenna within the unit to better shield it. Going forward, Nintendo said they do not anticipate any other problems with connectivity issues.[374][375] Many users also reported issues with defective pixels on the LCD screen of the console, which Nintendo has stated ""are normal and should not be considered a defect"".[376] Other companies in the video game industry such as Sony, Microsoft, Sega, Bethesda, Ubisoft and Unity Technologies congratulated Nintendo on the Switch, along with fast food companies such as Arby's and Domino's Pizza, which made a practice of posting game-inspired artworks on social media.[377]
About six months after its release, Nintendo reported their usage statistics for the Switch. Using statistics collected by the system for the primary player on the console, they found that 30% of users operate the console in Handheld/Tabletop mode more than 80% of the time, slightly more than 50% of users operate the console in both TV mode and Handheld/Tabletop mode equally, with the remaining users preferring TV mode. Nintendo stated, ""We can clearly see that consumers are playing to suit their own play styles.""[378] Nintendo also found that the majority of people who purchased the Switch in the United States are male consumers in their 20s and early 30s.[379]
Following the implementation of firmware version 5.0.0, several Switch users began reporting that their consoles became unusable after having been docked within a third-party ""portable"" dock manufactured by Nyko. Nyko commented on the issue, stating that they were aware of the issue and thought it to be caused by the Switch's handling of A/V output, while Nintendo advised users against docking their systems inside unlicensed docking peripherals. After purchasing the dock at a Walmart store in Jacksonville, Florida, and losing usability of his console upon using the dock, Switch owner Michael Skiathitis filed a class action lawsuit against Nyko, alleging the dock to be ""prone to causing numerous problems to the devices they are intended to support"" against the knowledge of purchasers, as well as noting that Nyko had not put much effort into warning consumers about the issue. Other Switch owners reported having their consoles bricked upon using various other third-party docks, including models made by FastSnail and Insignia.[380]
The Verge rated the Nintendo Switch Lite 8 out of 10 points, praising its improved battery life over the standard Nintendo Switch, as well as the design and the D-pad, but criticizing the lack of a TV mode and the fact that some games are not compatible with the base model alone.[381] PC Magazine criticized the components used in the Switch Lite for their quality because just like the Joy-Con of the original Nintendo Switch, the analog sticks of the console are also susceptible to drifting.[382] ""Today's generation is focused more on hand-held devices and any app that is on their television screen"", said game developer Tyrone Evans Clark who was being interviewed by Lifewire.[383] Jon Porter of TechRadar wrote, ""The Switch is a significantly different device from what we've seen prior, and the handheld nature of the console provides the best of both worlds.""[384] In 2021, PCMag wrote, ""As a handheld game system, the Switch feels large but comfortable. It's thicker than a tablet but much thinner than the Wii U gamepad, and far more natural to hold. It's 9.4 inches wide with both Joy-Con attached, making it too cumbersome to easily put in a pocket, but it can fit in most bags without a problem. I bring my Switch with me to work every day on the subway. It fits comfortably in my bag when I'm not playing it, and doesn't feel overwhelmingly bulky when I play it while standing.""[385] In 2024, Richard Priday of Tom's Guide wrote, ""Even though the Nintendo Switch is now several years old, it's still just as popular as its newer, more powerful rivals. With some of the best game franchises as exclusives and some unique hardware, it's a console you can't ignore.""[386]
Switch sales have been strongly tied to sales of Nintendo's first-party games, with nine having sold over twenty million copies each: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Party, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Pokémon Sword and Shield, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
Initial sales of the Switch were strong, with Nintendo reporting that based on its first week's numbers, it was the company's fastest-selling console.[387][388] In Japan, first weekend sales exceeded 330,000 units, which was on par with the PlayStation 4 during its launch period.[389][390] Sales during this initial period were strong in the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany.[391] Media Create estimated that more than 500,000 Switch units were sold in Japan within its first month, beating out the PlayStation 4 to this figure.[392][393][394][395][396]
Nintendo issued the Switch's first month's performance in their 2016 fiscal year results (which ended March 31, 2017), reporting that more than 2.74 million units had been sold worldwide, exceeding their target of two million.[397][398] Retailer GameStop reported that initial sales of the Switch were ""phenomenal"" and on track to surpass the Wii U based on their historical sales data, with merchandising director Eric Bright saying the Switch has had ""one of the highest attach rates of software and accessories to a device that we've seen in a long time"".[399] Retailer GameStop reported significant growth in hardware sales in its first quarter of 2017 due primarily to the Switch,[400] while Best Buy saw an unexpected increase in their hardware sales in its first quarter of 2017 buoyed by the popularity of the Switch.[401] Console sales in Japan, which had been languishing due to the strength of the mobile game market, saw its first annual growth of 14.8% in 2017 due to the release of the Switch.[402] Physical sales for Switch games were at 5.46 million worldwide in its first month, with 2.76 million copies of Breath of the Wild for the Switch making up nearly half of those sales.[403] On Breath of the Wild's nearly 1-to-1 sales with the Switch console, Nintendo's Kimishima said, ""This high of an attach rate is more or less unprecedented"".[404]
The large sales within the first month forced Nintendo to increase their production capacity,[405] and to temporarily use air freight to ship Switch units instead of their usual overseas shipment, costing an estimated $45 per console, rather than the less-costly overseas shipment.[406] With these changes, Nintendo projected that it would sell at least 10 million Switch consoles during the 2017 fiscal year, alongside 35 million games.[397] Kimishima stated that having a Switch user base of 10 million ""will give publishers and the rest of our business partners a sense that the future of Nintendo Switch is more promising"" and spur further game development for the platform.[407] Kimishima said that a key goal in their production ramp up would be to make sure they have enough Switch inventory near the end of 2017 for holiday sales, as to avoid the issue with Wii shortages that occurred during its first holiday-season period, while balancing the near-term high demand.[179] According to Kimishima, Nintendo now believed that if they could reach 10 million in Switch sales in 2017, they expected the Switch would have lifetime sales comparable to the Wii, which had sold over 100 million units in its lifetime.[407][179]
The Switch continued to show strong sales throughout its first year of release. In its financial report released in October 2017 for the quarter ending September 30, 2017, Nintendo reported worldwide sales of the Switch at 7.63 million, with the expectation to sell more than 14 million by the end of its current financial year, exceeding the Wii U's lifetime 13.56 million sales. Five games had achieved at least one million in sales by this point: Breath of the Wild (4.7M), Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (4.42M), Splatoon 2 (3.61M), 1-2 Switch (1.37M), and Arms (1.35M).[408] Shortly after this financial report, Nintendo reported that Super Mario Odyssey for the Switch sold more than two million copies within three days of its release on October 27, 2017.[409] Following this financial report, the Wall Street Journal asserted that Nintendo anticipated to continue ramping production of the Switch in its 2018 fiscal year, with plans to produce between 25 and 30 million units that year or more depending on the 2017 holiday sales.[351] During the November 2017 Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday sales that kicked off the holiday shopping season in North America, Adobe Digital Insights' analysis showed the Switch was one of the top-five selling items, outpacing the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One. NPD Group adjusted their future performance of the Switch to follow more closely with the Wii's lifetime sales rather than the Wii U's.[410]
On December 12, 2017, the company announced the system had sold over 10 million units worldwide, having reached its sales goal for the 2017 fiscal year within nine months. Nintendo raised its Switch sales expectation to 14 million units for the fiscal year.[411] Shortly after this announcement, Kimishima said that Nintendo has a target of 20 million units sold within the console's second year, along with releasing new games that ""enables new ways of playing"" to continue the sales momentum.[412]
Based on its first year sales, the Switch was considered to be the fastest-selling game console in history in many regions. With 2017 year end Japanese sales data from Media Create, the Switch became the fastest-selling home console in Japan in first year sales, with its total sales of 3.2 million units exceeding the 3.0 million units of the PlayStation 2 during its first year of release,[413][414] while Famitsu reported that these sales had eclipsed the lifetime sales of the Wii U in the country,[415] and helped to support the first growth in sales within Japan's console market in eleven years.[416] Nintendo of America also reported that with 4.8 million units sold in the United States by the end of 2017, 1.5 million units in December 2017 alone, the Switch was the fastest-selling console in the United States in its first 10 months, outpacing the Wii's performance of 4 million units in the same time period.[417][418] Similarly, the Switch was the fastest-selling console in France, having sold 911,000 units through the end of 2017, according to Nintendo France.[419] The Switch was also the fastest-selling console in Canada, having shipped 400,000 units in its first 10 months, narrowly outpacing the Wii's performance of 392,000 units in the same time period, according to TechVibes.[420] According to analysis firm GBH Insights, the Nintendo Switch was the fifth-best-selling technology product in 2017.[421] As of January 2018, the Switch has sold more than 300,000 units in Spain, surpassing the total lifetime sales of one of its competitors, the Xbox One, in the region.[422] The Switch sold 8.7 million units in the United States in its first 21 months of availability, surpassing the sales of Xbox One and PlayStation 4 during their first 21 months in the same region.[423] By May 2019, the Switch had overtaken the PS4's lifetime sales in Japan.[424]
As of June 30, 2025[update], Nintendo has shipped 153.10 million Switch units, with over 96.6 million original Switch units, 25.72 million Switch Lite units, and 30.72 million Switch OLED units.[458][459] It is currently Nintendo's best-selling home video game console of all time.[q] The Switch has surpassed lifetime sales of all but one Nintendo game console following the Nintendo DS. By this point, it also surpassed sales of all other game consoles, leaving it third behind the DS and the PlayStation 2.[461][462] Since October 2020,[update] the Switch had been the highest selling console in the United States for 22 consecutive months, starting from December 2018, taking the record from the Xbox 360 which stood for 21 months (August 2011 (2011-08) – April 2013 (2013-05)).[463] In the United States, the Switch had remained the best-selling console on monthly sales based on NPD Group data for 33 months from November 2018 through August 2021, with the PlayStation 5 breaking its streak in September 2021.[464]
Nintendo's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, said in the company's Q4 fiscal earnings report, ending December 21, 2019, that about 30% of the sales of the Switch Lite were from existing owners of the full-size Switch console, making the Lite a backup console for them. Furukawa also said that, for those purchasing their first Switch console, there was a higher percentage of female consumers that purchased the Lite compared to the full-size Switch console, and that Nintendo would increase production of the Lite for that market.[465]
As of March 2025[update], total software sales for the Switch reached just under 1.4 billion.[452] According to Nintendo of America's Doug Bowser, the Switch has had an attach rate (games purchased per unit) of over 8 over its first four years.[466] Top sellers for the platform as of March 31, 2025, include:[467]
Nintendo's business performance, which had been struggling for several years, soared upon the release of the Switch. By May 23, 2017, the success of the Switch's launch raised Nintendo's stock price to its highest levels in seven years, and an increase in price of over 100% from the previous year. However, the price still trailed Nintendo's peak price by about half, back in 2007 when it had just released the Wii.[468] Nintendo's stock was further boosted a few days later to meet its eight-year high following Capcom's announcement of plans to release the popular Monster Hunter XX for the Switch.[469]
In September 2017, Nintendo announced a partnership with Tencent, the leading publisher for mobile games in China, to bring their game Arena of Valor, the international version of their mainland Chinese game Wangzhe Rongyao, to the Switch following its December 2017 release in Western markets on mobile platforms. At the time, the game had an estimated 200 million players, most in China, and analysts anticipated that Nintendo would be releasing the Switch in China by 2019 as part of this deal. As a result, Nintendo's stock price rose overnight on the news by 7%, reaching a nine-year high.[470][471][472] Nintendo's stock reached its ten-year high shortly after the October 2017 expansion of Switch production to 2 million units per month and speculation that Nintendo would likely start selling the unit in China sooner than anticipated.[473]
Nintendo's quarterly reports, for the period ending September 30, 2017, showed a profit of $209 million, the first profitable quarter in several years, due to both success of the Switch and its mobile gaming strategy.[30] For similar reasons, its following quarter, ending December 31, 2017, was Nintendo's most profitable quarter since 2009, with year-to-year revenues increasing by 177%.[474][475]
Nintendo's quarterly profit jumped by 44% in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 and their net profit totaled $274.9 million during April–June 2018 due to new games being released for the Switch, such as Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze.[476] Sales of the Switch and its games helped increase Nintendo's operating profit by 30% during July–September 2018 and helped Nintendo reach its highest quarterly result in 8 years.[477] Nintendo's quarterly profit jumped by 25% in the third fiscal quarter of 2018 due to the popularity of games on the Switch and their October–December profit totaled $956 million, while quarterly sales totaled $5.6 billion, which were up by 26%.[478]
Nintendo's yearly profit jumped by 39% during the April 2018–March 2019 fiscal year, and annual sales rose 14% to $10.7 billion due to ""healthy"" software sales for the Switch.[479]
In August 2017, Los Angeles-based tablet peripheral manufacturer Gamevice, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Nintendo in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that the design of the Switch conflicts with its patent on the design for the Wikipad, an Android-based gaming device that also features a tablet with a detachable controller. The lawsuit sought damages on existing Switch sales and banning further sales of the console.[480] The lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed by Gamevice in October 2017.[481]
In March 2018, Gamevice initiated a second patent infringement lawsuit on Nintendo related to a different set of patents. Gamevice also sought action through the United States International Trade Commission related to patent infringement under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, and was seeking to block imports of the Switch into the United States.[482][483][484] The lawsuit would be terminated on October 10, 2019, with no such violations being found.[485] By March 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office had reviewed Gamevice's patents and deemed all of its claims to be unpatentable, a ruling in favor of Nintendo. Gamevice stated they would be challenging the Office's decision.[486]
While appealing the Patent Office's determination on its patents, Gamevice initiated a third infringement claim against Nintendo in March 2020 against a newly published patent it had obtained in August based on a game controller that would wrap around a smart phone. Gamevice sought to block imports of the Switch from Japan while the lawsuit was in progress.[487][488] The lawsuit ended in favor of Nintendo.[489][490]
A class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington in July 2019 concerning a joystick defect in the console's Joy-Con controllers, commonly referred to as ""drift"". The suit alleges that Nintendo is aware of a defect that causes the controllers to register movements without the joysticks being touched, but does not ""disclose the defect and routinely refuses to repair the joysticks without charge"".[491] Three days after the filing, an internal Nintendo company memo was leaked by Vice; the memo instructed Nintendo's customer service employees in North America to begin offering repairs for drifting Joy-Con controllers free of charge regardless of warranty status.[492] The lawsuit, however, continued, and following the release of the Nintendo Switch Lite where some on social media reported the Joy-Con drift problem after 20 hours of play, additional complaints related to the Lite were added to the lawsuit.[493] While the court refused to grant Nintendo a dismissal of the case, it did agree to send the case into arbitration as a first step as outlined in the EULA for the Switch in a ruling made in March 2020.[494]
Nintendo successfully obtained an injunction in December 2019 against a distributor of a hack made by Team Xecuter that enabled Switch users to obtain and run copyright-violating copies of Switch games on the console.[495] Afterwards Nintendo filed lawsuits initially against several resellers of Team Xecuter products in 2020, and in one case, settled with the reseller for $2 million.[496][497] After members of Team Xecuter were arrested and charged with eleven felony counts by the United States Department of Justice in October 2020, Nintendo filed another lawsuit against one of the arrested members, Gary Bowser; he faces two counts of trafficking and one count of copyright infringement.[498]
The successor console, the Nintendo Switch 2, was formally revealed on January 16, 2025, and released on June 5th, 2025. An April 2 Nintendo Direct revealed further details, including its release on June 5 later that year.[499] Like with the Switch, several hands-on events were offered in worldwide locations in the second half of April.[500]
Industry rumors of a new console emerged in July 2023, as several of Nintendo's development partners reported on receiving development kits for this new system.[501] Nintendo alluded to a successor console, such as retaining the use of Nintendo Accounts, but had avoided affirming any details on a new console.[502]
Eurogamer, among other sources, learned from insiders that Nintendo demonstrated features of the new console at Gamescom 2023 behind closed doors to developers.[503] In mid-2023, document discovery in the FTC v. Microsoft case revealed that Activision was briefed about the ""Switch NG"" (NG for next generation) in late 2022, with its performance stated to be similar to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.[504]
Confirmed changes to the Switch 2 include a larger screen, a redesigned kickstand, and Joy-Con that connects through a plug-like slot rather than through a sliding rail as the original Joy-Con.[505] The new console's alleged system on a chip, the Nvidia Tegra T239 (codenamed ""Drake""), was leaked in the 2022 Nvidia ransomware attack by Lapsus$, and features an octa-core ARM Cortex-A78C CPU, a 12 SM Ampere GPU, and a 128-bit LPDDR5 RAM interface.[506] Later analysis from public customs manifests suggested it to have 12 GB of LPDDR5X-7500 RAM and 128 GB of UFS (Universal Flash Storage) 3.1 internal storage.[507] Sharp Corporation stated it had been providing Nintendo LCD screens for the new console since mid-2023, and technology analysis firm Omdia stated these were likely to be 8-inch screens.[508] Other reports stated the new console will have DLSS and ray tracing integration, and that developers have been shown tech demos running on targeted hardware, namely The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild at 4K resolution and a frame rate of 60 frames per second, as well as Epic Games' The Matrix Awakens tech demo for Unreal Engine 5.[509] Early rumors claimed the new system was to be released in late 2024, with Nintendo working with its partners to assure high volumes of product at launch.[501] Altec Lansing had issued a press release in January 2024 that claimed the Switch successor would be out in September 2024, which their social media later claimed was just a guess.[510] An analyst for Japan-based Kantan Games stated in January 2024 that the ""pro"" model of the Switch should be seen as an iteration of the Switch console rather than a revolution from it, and likely would be priced at $400, with new games costing $70.[511] However, by February 2024, sources had stated Nintendo had told partners that its release was pushed into early 2025,[512][513][514] with sources speaking to The Nikkei that this was for Nintendo to have sufficient supply and combat scalping.[515] Several vendors showcased accessories for the upcoming console at the  January 2025 Consumer Electronics Show, along with reports of a planned April 2025 launch.[516]
The Switch 2 has backwards compatibility with most physical and digital Switch games, and will continue to use the Nintendo Switch Online service.[505] Earlier reports suggested that some Switch games, such as Breath of the Wild, will be released in an ""enhanced"" version that will take advantage of the successor hardware.[517] It also uses magnetic Joy-Con (with the right controller having a new button), and has a different dock design.[518] During the reveal trailer, a new Mario Kart game[r] was unveiled, featuring a different art style reminiscent of both Super Mario Bros. Wonder and The Super Mario Bros. Movie.[520][521]
Furukawa said during the company's quarterly earnings report in February 2025 that Nintendo plans to continue to support the original Switch console after the Switch 2's release as long as there is demand.[522]

Comics is a medium used to express ideas with images, often combined with text or other visual information. It typically takes the form of a sequence of panels of images. Textual devices such as speech balloons, captions, and onomatopoeia can indicate dialogue, narration, sound effects, or other information. There is no consensus among theorists and historians on a definition of comics; some emphasize the combination of images and text, some sequentiality or other image relations, and others historical aspects such as mass reproduction or the use of recurring characters. Cartooning and other forms of illustration are the most common means of image-making in comics. Photo comics is a form that uses photographic images. Common forms include comic strips, editorial and gag cartoons, and comic books. Since the late 20th century, bound volumes such as graphic novels, and comic albums, have become increasingly common, along with webcomics.
The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished, particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, while Wilhelm Busch and his Max and Moritz also had a global impact from 1865 on,[1][2][3][4] and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as The Adventures of Tintin. American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, and the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics (manga) propose origins as early as the 12th century. Japanese comics are generally held separate from the evolution of Euro-American comics, and Western comic art probably originated in 17th-century Italy.[5] Modern Japanese comic strips emerged in the early 20th century, and the output of comic magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era (1945)– with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. Comics has had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century, it began to find greater acceptance with the public and academics.

The English term comics is used as a singular noun when it refers to the medium itself (e.g. ""Comics is a visual art form.""), but as a plural when referring to works collectively (e.g. ""Comics are popular reading material."").The European, American, and Japanese comics traditions have followed different paths.[6] Europeans have seen their tradition as beginning with the Swiss Rodolphe Töpffer from as early as 1827 and Americans have seen the origin of theirs in Richard F. Outcault's 1890s newspaper strip The Yellow Kid, though many Americans have come to recognize Töpffer's precedence. Wilhelm Busch directly influenced Rudolph Dirks and his Katzenjammer Kids.[7][8][9][10][11] Japan has a long history of satirical cartoons and comics leading up to the World War II era. The ukiyo-e artist Hokusai popularized the Japanese term for comics and cartooning, manga, in the early 19th century.[12] In the 1930s Harry ""A"" Chesler started a comics studio, which eventually at its height employed 40 artists working for 50 different publishers who helped make the comics medium flourish in ""the Golden Age of Comics"" after World War II.[13] In the post-war era modern Japanese comics began to flourish when Osamu Tezuka produced a prolific body of work.[14] Towards the close of the 20th century, these three traditions converged in a trend towards book-length comics: the comic album in Europe, the tankōbon[a] in Japan, and the graphic novel in the English-speaking countries.[6]
Outside of these genealogies, comics theorists and historians have seen precedents for comics in the Lascaux cave paintings[15] in France (some of which appear to be chronological sequences of images), Egyptian hieroglyphs, Trajan's Column in Rome,[16] the 11th-century Norman Bayeux Tapestry,[17] the 1370 bois Protat woodcut, the 15th-century Ars moriendi and block books, Michelangelo's The Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel,[16] and William Hogarth's 18th-century sequential engravings,[18] amongst others.[16][b]
Illustrated humour periodicals were popular in 19th-century Britain, the earliest of which was the short-lived The Glasgow Looking Glass in 1825.[20] The most popular was Punch,[21] which popularized the term cartoon for its humorous caricatures.[22] On occasion the cartoons in these magazines appeared in sequences;[21] the character Ally Sloper featured in the earliest serialized comic strip when the character began to feature in its own weekly magazine in 1884.[23]
American comics developed out of such magazines as Puck, Judge, and Life. The success of illustrated humour supplements in the New York World and later the New York American, particularly Outcault's The Yellow Kid, led to the development of newspaper comic strips. Early Sunday strips were full-page[24] and often in colour. Between 1896 and 1901 cartoonists experimented with sequentiality, movement, and speech balloons.[25] An example is Gustave Verbeek, who wrote his comic series ""The UpsideDowns of Old Man Muffaroo and Little Lady Lovekins"" between 1903 and 1905. These comics were made in such a way that one could read the 6-panel comic, flip the book and keep reading. He made 64 such comics in total. In 2012, a remake of a selection of the comics was made by Marcus Ivarsson in the book 'In Uppåner med Lilla Lisen & Gamle Muppen'. (ISBN 978-91-7089-524-1)
Shorter, black-and-white daily strips began to appear early in the 20th century, and became established in newspapers after the success in 1907 of Bud Fisher's Mutt and Jeff.[26] In Britain, the Amalgamated Press established a popular style of a sequence of images with text beneath them, including Illustrated Chips and Comic Cuts.[27] Humour strips predominated at first, and in the 1920s and 1930s strips with continuing stories in genres such as adventure and drama also became popular.[26]
Thin periodicals called comic books appeared in the 1930s, at first reprinting newspaper comic strips; by the end of the decade, original content began to dominate.[28] The success in 1938 of Action Comics and its lead hero Superman marked the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books, in which the superhero genre was prominent.[29] In the UK and the Commonwealth, the DC Thomson-created Dandy (1937) and Beano (1938) became successful humor-based titles, with a combined circulation of over 2 million copies by the 1950s. Their characters, including ""Dennis the Menace"", ""Desperate Dan"" and ""The Bash Street Kids"" have been read by generations of British children.[30] The comics originally experimented with superheroes and action stories before settling on humorous strips featuring a mix of the Amalgamated Press and US comic book styles.[31]
The popularity of superhero comic books declined in the years following World War II,[32] while comic book sales continued to increase as other genres proliferated, such as romance, westerns, crime, horror, and humour.[33] Following a sales peak in the early 1950s, the content of comic books (particularly crime and horror) was subjected to scrutiny from parent groups and government agencies, which culminated in Senate hearings that led to the establishment of the Comics Code Authority self-censoring body.[34] The Code has been blamed for stunting the growth of American comics and maintaining its low status in American society for much of the remainder of the century.[35] Superheroes re-established themselves as the most prominent comic book genre by the early 1960s.[36] Underground comix challenged the Code and readers with adult, countercultural content in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[37] The underground gave birth to the alternative comics movement in the 1980s and its mature, often experimental content in non-superhero genres.[38]
Comics in the US has had a lowbrow reputation stemming from its roots in mass culture; cultural elites sometimes saw popular culture as threatening culture and society. In the latter half of the 20th century, popular culture won greater acceptance, and the lines between high and low culture began to blur. Comics nevertheless continued to be stigmatized, as the medium was seen as entertainment for children and illiterates.[39]
The graphic novel—book-length comics—began to gain attention after Will Eisner popularized the term with his book A Contract with God (1978).[40] The term became widely known with the public after the commercial success of Maus, Watchmen, and The Dark Knight Returns in the mid-1980s.[41] In the 21st century graphic novels became established in mainstream bookstores[42] and libraries[43] and webcomics became common.[44]
The francophone Swiss Rodolphe Töpffer produced comic strips beginning in 1827,[16] and published theories behind the form.[45] Wilhelm Busch first published his Max and Moritz in 1865.[46] Cartoons appeared widely in newspapers and magazines from the 19th century.[47] The success of Zig et Puce in 1925 popularized the use of speech balloons in European comics, after which Franco-Belgian comics began to dominate.[48] The Adventures of Tintin, with its signature clear line style,[49] was first serialized in newspaper comics supplements beginning in 1929,[50] and became an icon of Franco-Belgian comics.[51]
Following the success of Le Journal de Mickey (est. 1934),[52] dedicated comics magazines[53] like Spirou (est. 1938) and Tintin (1946–1993), and full-colour comic albums became the primary outlet for comics in the mid-20th century.[54] As in the US, at the time comics were seen as infantile and a threat to culture and literacy; commentators stated that ""none bear up to the slightest serious analysis"",[c] and that comics were ""the sabotage of all art and all literature"".[56][d]
In the 1960s, the term bandes dessinées (""drawn strips"") came into wide use in French to denote the medium.[57] Cartoonists began creating comics for mature audiences,[58] and the term ""Ninth Art""[e] was coined, as comics began to attract public and academic attention as an artform.[59] A group including René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo founded the magazine Pilote in 1959 to give artists greater freedom over their work. Goscinny and Uderzo's The Adventures of Asterix appeared in it[60] and went on to become the best-selling French-language comics series.[61] From 1960, the satirical and taboo-breaking Hara-Kiri defied censorship laws in the countercultural spirit that led to the May 1968 events.[62]
Frustration with censorship and editorial interference led to a group of Pilote cartoonists to found the adults-only L'Écho des savanes in 1972. Adult-oriented and experimental comics flourished in the 1970s, such as in the experimental science fiction of Mœbius and others in Métal hurlant, even mainstream publishers took to publishing prestige-format adult comics.[63]
From the 1980s, mainstream sensibilities were reasserted and serialization became less common as the number of comics magazines decreased and many comics began to be published directly as albums.[64] Smaller publishers such as L'Association[65] that published longer works[66] in non-traditional formats[67] by auteur-istic creators also became common. Since the 1990s, mergers resulted in fewer large publishers, while smaller publishers proliferated. Sales overall continued to grow despite the trend towards a shrinking print market.[68]
Japanese comics and cartooning (manga),[g] have a history that has been seen as far back as the anthropomorphic characters in the 12th-to-13th-century Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga, 17th-century toba-e and kibyōshi picture books,[72] and woodblock prints such as ukiyo-e which were popular between the 17th and 20th centuries. The kibyōshi contained examples of sequential images, movement lines,[73] and sound effects.[74]
Illustrated magazines for Western expatriates introduced Western-style satirical cartoons to Japan in the late 19th century. New publications in both the Western and Japanese styles became popular, and at the end of the 1890s, American-style newspaper comics supplements began to appear in Japan,[75] as well as some American comic strips.[72] 1900 saw the debut of the Jiji Manga in the Jiji Shinpō newspaper—the first use of the word ""manga"" in its modern sense,[71] and where, in 1902, Rakuten Kitazawa began the first modern Japanese comic strip.[76] By the 1930s, comic strips were serialized in large-circulation monthly girls' and boys' magazine and collected into hardback volumes.[77]
The modern era of comics in Japan began after World War II, propelled by the success of the serialized comics of the prolific Osamu Tezuka[78] and the comic strip Sazae-san.[79] Genres and audiences diversified over the following decades. Stories are usually first serialized in magazines which are often hundreds of pages thick and may contain over a dozen stories;[80] they are later compiled in tankōbon-format books.[81] At the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, nearly a quarter of all printed material in Japan was comics.[82] Translations became extremely popular in foreign markets—in some cases equaling or surpassing the sales of domestic comics.[83]
Manhwa ( 만화 ) refers to Korean comics and print cartoons, with the term often used internationally to designate comics originating in Korea. While manhwa shares cultural and linguistic roots with Japanese manga and Chinese manhua, it has developed a unique identity influenced by Korea's historical, cultural, and artistic landscape. Modern manhwa has gained global popularity, partly due to the rise of webtoons—digitally formatted comics designed for scrolling on mobile devices. This success has contributed to adaptations into movies, dramas, and television series.[citation needed]
The concept of manhwa emerged under the influence of Japanese manga during the Japanese occupation of Korea in the early 20th century. Manga's established presence in Japan during this period strongly shaped the foundational styles and formats of Korean comics. As Korea transitioned into independence, manhwa evolved into a distinct medium, balancing the artistic influences of its neighbors with traditional Korean aesthetics and storytelling.[citation needed]
In the early 20th century, many political humour magazines appeared which contained caricatures of local politicians and celebrities.The most famous of them is Caras y caretas, which continues to be published in the present.[84]
By the 1940s and 1950s, the Argentine comic industry flourished through new characters oriented to children and teenagers, such as Patoruzú (a wealthy tehuelche cacique of Patagonia) and Isidoro Cañones (a frivolous man of Buenos Aires), both created by Dante Quinterno.[85][86]
Between 1957 and 1959 El Eternauta was published. It was an internationally acclaimed attempt to create more mature comic stories in Argentina. It was created by Héctor Germán Oesterheld and Francisco Solano López as a science fiction story about an alien invasion in Buenos Aires, along with a toxic snowfall that would kill anyone who touched it. It is considered to represent the dictatorship of 1955 which persecuted peronists (Oesterheld himself being peronist). Oesterheld and his whole family would end up being disappeared by the dictatorship.[87]
In the 1960s, Anteojito children's magazine was created, in which Manuel García Ferré would go on to publish the stories of many characters that would become household names, such as Hijitus (a poor and naive boy whose hat gave him superpowers) and Larguirucho (his companion).[88]
Between the 1960s and 1970s, one of the most famous comic characters of Argentina appeared, Mafalda, created by Quino. It was popular all over Latin America and Europe. Mafalda was considered a satire of the middle-class urban families, and showcased the progressive political inclinations of the youth.[89]
In the 1970s a relevant comic character was Clemente, created by Caloi. It was a fictional animal without arms or wings, who only ate olives and drank mate. Despite the 1970s being a time of political turmoil in Argentina, Clemente was peronist and fond of association football.[90]
Comic strips are generally short, multipanel comics that have, since the early 20th century, most commonly appeared in newspapers. In the US, daily strips have normally occupied a single tier, while Sunday strips have been given multiple tiers. Since the early 20th century, daily newspaper comic strips have typically been printed in black-and-white and Sunday comics have usually been printed in colour and have often occupied a full newspaper page.[91]
Specialized comics periodicals formats vary greatly in different cultures. Comic books, primarily an American format, are thin periodicals[92] usually published in colour.[93] European and Japanese comics are frequently serialized in magazines—monthly or weekly in Europe,[71] and usually black-and-white and weekly or monthly in Japan.[94] Japanese comics magazines typically run to hundreds of pages.[95]
Book-length comics take different forms in different cultures. European comic albums are most commonly colour volumes printed at A4-size, a larger page size than used in many other cultures.[96][54] In English-speaking countries, the trade paperback format originating from collected comic books have also been chosen for original material. Otherwise, bound volumes of comics are called graphic novels and are available in various formats. Despite incorporating the term ""novel""—a term normally associated with fiction—""graphic novel"" also refers to non-fiction and collections of short works.[97] Japanese comics are collected in volumes called tankōbon following magazine serialization.[98]
Gag and editorial cartoons usually consist of a single panel, often incorporating a caption or speech balloon. Definitions of comics which emphasize sequence usually exclude gag, editorial, and other single-panel cartoons; they can be included in definitions that emphasize the combination of word and image.[99] Gag cartoons first began to proliferate in broadsheets published in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the term ""cartoon""[h] was first used to describe them in 1843 in the British humour magazine Punch.[22]
Webcomics are comics that are available on the internet, first being published the 1980s. They are able to potentially reach large audiences, and new readers can often access archives of previous installments.[100] Webcomics can make use of an infinite canvas, meaning they are not constrained by the size or dimensions of a printed comics page.[101]
Some consider storyboards[102] and wordless novels to be comics.[103] Film studios, especially in animation, often use sequences of images as guides for film sequences. These storyboards are not intended as an end product and are rarely seen by the public.[102] Wordless novels are books which use sequences of captionless images to deliver a narrative.[104]
""Comics ... are sometimes four-legged and sometimes two-legged and sometimes fly and sometimes don't ... to employ a metaphor as mixed as the medium itself, defining comics entails cutting a Gordian-knotted enigma wrapped in a mystery ...""
Similar to the problems of defining literature and film,[105] no consensus has been reached on a definition of the comics medium,[106] and attempted definitions and descriptions have fallen prey to numerous exceptions.[107] Theorists such as Töpffer,[108] R. C. Harvey, Will Eisner,[109] David Carrier,[110] Alain Rey,[106] and Lawrence Grove emphasize the combination of text and images,[111] though there are prominent examples of pantomime comics throughout its history.[107] Other critics, such as Thierry Groensteen[111] and Scott McCloud, have emphasized the primacy of sequences of images.[112] Towards the close of the 20th century, different cultures' discoveries of each other's comics traditions, the rediscovery of forgotten early comics forms, and the rise of new forms made defining comics a more complicated task.[113]
European comics studies began with Töpffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination. No further progress was made until the 1970s.[114] Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed ""closure"".[115] In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or ""multiframe"", to refer to the comics page as a semantic unit.[116] By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices.[115] Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of ""les littératures dessinées"" (or ""drawn literatures"").[113] French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions.[116] In the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn began analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound ""grammars"" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.[117]
Historical narratives of manga tend to focus either on its recent, post-WWII history, or on attempts to demonstrate deep roots in the past, such as to the Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga picture scroll of the 12th and 13th centuries, or the early 19th-century Hokusai Manga.[118] The first historical overview of Japanese comics was Seiki Hosokibara's Nihon Manga-Shi[i] in 1924.[119] Early post-war Japanese criticism was mostly of a left-wing political nature until the 1986 publication of Tomofusa Kure's Modern Manga: The Complete Picture,[j] which de-emphasized politics in favour of formal aspects, such as structure and a ""grammar"" of comics. The field of manga studies increased rapidly, with numerous books on the subject appearing in the 1990s.[120] Formal theories of manga have focused on developing a ""manga expression theory"",[k] with emphasis on spatial relationships in the structure of images on the page, distinguishing the medium from film or literature, in which the flow of time is the basic organizing element.[121] Comics studies courses have proliferated at Japanese universities, and Japan Society for Studies in Cartoon and Comics (ja)[l] was established in 2001 to promote comics scholarship.[122] The publication of Frederik L. Schodt's Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics in 1983 led to the spread of use of the word manga outside Japan to mean ""Japanese comics"" or ""Japanese-style comics"".[123]
Coulton Waugh attempted the first comprehensive history of American comics with The Comics (1947).[124] Will Eisner's Comics and Sequential Art (1985) and Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics (1993) were early attempts in English to formalize the study of comics. David Carrier's The Aesthetics of Comics (2000) was the first full-length treatment of comics from a philosophical perspective.[125] Prominent American attempts at definitions of comics include Eisner's, McCloud's, and Harvey's. Eisner described what he called ""sequential art"" as ""the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea"";[126] Scott McCloud defined comics as ""juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer"",[127] a strictly formal definition which detached comics from its historical and cultural trappings.[128] R. C. Harvey defined comics as ""pictorial narratives or expositions in which words (often lettered into the picture area within speech balloons) usually contribute to the meaning of the pictures and vice versa"".[129] Each definition has had its detractors. Harvey saw McCloud's definition as excluding single-panel cartoons,[130] and objected to McCloud's de-emphasizing verbal elements, insisting ""the essential characteristic of comics is the incorporation of verbal content"".[116] Aaron Meskin saw McCloud's theories as an artificial attempt to legitimize the place of comics in art history.[109]
Cross-cultural study of comics is complicated by the great difference in meaning and scope of the words for ""comics"" in different languages.[131] The French term for comics, bandes dessinées (""drawn strip"") emphasizes the juxtaposition of drawn images as a defining factor,[132] which can imply the exclusion of even photographic comics.[133] The term manga is used in Japanese to indicate all forms of comics, cartooning,[134] and caricature.[131]
The term comics refers to the comics medium when used as an uncountable noun and thus takes the singular: ""comics is a medium"" rather than ""comics are a medium"". When comic appears as a countable noun it refers to instances of the medium, such as individual comic strips or comic books: ""Tom's comics are in the basement.""[135]
Panels are individual images containing a segment of action,[136] often surrounded by a border.[137] Prime moments in a narrative are broken down into panels via a process called encapsulation.[138] The reader puts the pieces together via the process of closure by using background knowledge and an understanding of panel relations to combine panels mentally into events.[139] The size, shape, and arrangement of panels each affect the timing and pacing of the narrative.[140] The contents of a panel may be asynchronous, with events depicted in the same image not necessarily occurring at the same time.[141]
Text is frequently incorporated into comics via speech balloons, captions, and sound effects. Speech balloons indicate dialogue (or thought, in the case of thought balloons), with tails pointing at their respective speakers.[142] Captions can give voice to a narrator, convey characters' dialogue or thoughts,[143] or indicate place or time.[144] Speech balloons themselves are strongly associated with comics, such that the addition of one to an image is sufficient to turn the image into comics.[145] Sound effects mimic non-vocal sounds textually using onomatopoeia sound-words.[146]
Cartooning is most frequently used in making comics, traditionally using ink (especially India ink) with dip pens or ink brushes;[147] mixed media and digital technology have become common. Cartooning techniques such as motion lines[148] and abstract symbols are often employed.[149]
While comics are often the work of a single creator, the labour of making them is frequently divided between a number of specialists. There may be separate writers and artists, and artists may specialize in parts of the artwork such as characters or backgrounds, as is common in Japan.[150] Particularly in American superhero comic books,[151] the art may be divided between a penciller, who lays out the artwork in pencil;[152] an inker, who finishes the artwork in ink;[153] a colourist;[154] and a letterer, who adds the captions and speech balloons.[155]
The English-language term comics derives from the humorous (or ""comic"") work which predominated in early American newspaper comic strips, but usage of the term has become standard for non-humorous works as well. The alternate spelling comix – coined by the underground comix movement – is sometimes used to address such ambiguities.[156] The term ""comic book"" has a similarly confusing history since they are most often not humorous and are periodicals, not regular books.[157] It is common in English to refer to the comics of different cultures by the terms used in their languages, such as manga for Japanese comics, or bandes dessinées for French-language Franco-Belgian comics.[158]
Many cultures have taken their word for comics from English, including Russian (комикс, komiks)[159] and German (Comic).[160] Similarly, the Chinese term manhua[161] and the Korean manhwa[162] derive from the Chinese characters with which the Japanese term manga is written.[163]

Rock Paper Shotgun (also rendered as Rock, Paper, Shotgun) is a British video game journalism website. It was launched in 2007 to focus on PC games and was acquired by Gamer Network, a network of sites led by Eurogamer, in May 2017.
Rock Paper Shotgun was founded by Kieron Gillen, Jim Rossignol, Alec Meer and John Walker in 2007.[1] Gillen announced that he would no longer be involved in posting the day-to-day content of Rock Paper Shotgun in 2010, focusing more on his work with Marvel Comics.[2] Rossignol founded his own game studio, Big Robot, in 2010.[3] Meer and Walker left in 2019.[4][5]
In June 2010, Rock Paper Shotgun began an advertising partnership with the Eurogamer Network.[6] Also in the year, Rock Paper Shotgun partnered with Eurogamer to create Rezzed, a PC and indie games show spun off from the Eurogamer Expo.[7][8] In May 2017, Gamer Network acquired the site outright.[9] A year later, website has partnered again with EGX to launch a new game jam, designed to showcase and promote a standout indie game developer or team.[10]
The Gamer Network was acquired by ReedPOP in 2018, making the site a subsidiary of RELX Group.[11] In May 2024, IGN Entertainment acquired the Gamer Network, making Rock Paper Shotgun a subsidiary of Ziff Davis.[12][13]
On 5 January 2011, Game Informer editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner issued legal threats against Rock Paper Shotgun and its readers for posting exclusive Game Informer images from the Tomb Raider reboot. Rock Paper Shotgun later deleted the images the same day.[14][non-primary source needed] One month later, the game Bulletstorm came under scrutiny by Fox News. These claims were largely ridiculed among gaming websites, including Rock Paper Shotgun, who ran a series of articles discrediting the reports by Fox News.[15][16] The articles analysed Carole Lieberman's claims and found only one of eight sources she provided had anything to do with the subject at hand.[17] Fox News acknowledged that they had been contacted by Rock Paper Shotgun and responded to their claims on 20 February 2011 through another article, stating that the game still remained a threat to children.[18]
It won the best Games blog accolade at the 2011 Games Media Awards.[19]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Heroes,Amazing Heroes,"
Amazing Heroes was a magazine about the comic book medium published by American company Fantagraphics Books from 1981 to 1992. Unlike its companion title, The Comics Journal, Amazing Heroes was a hobbyist magazine rather than an analytical journal.[1]
Fantagraphics decided to publish Amazing Heroes as another income stream to supplement The Comics Journal. As long-time Fantagraphics co-publisher Kim Thompson put it: ""If you want to look at it cynically, we set out to steal The Comic Reader's cheese. Which we did.""[2]
Amazing Heroes' first editor was Fantagraphics' head of promotion and circulation, Michael Catron. His inability to meet deadlines led to his being replaced after issue #6[3][4] by Comics Journal editor Kim Thompson.
The magazine was initially published under the Fantagraphics imprint Zam Inc.,[5] through issue #6.[6] Beginning with #7, the publishing imprint became Redbeard Inc.[7] It remained under Redbeard through at least issue #61,[8] but by issue #68 was being published directly by Fantagraphics Books, Inc.[9]
The magazine began as a monthly, then appeared twice a month for many years, and then went monthly again beginning in 1989. The magazine ran for 204 issues, folding with its July 1992 issue.[10] The final issue was released as a flip book, with issue #203 on the front and issue #204 inverted on the back. It also released a number of special issues, such as Amazing Heroes Preview Special #1–5, 10, & 11 (1985–1990), Amazing Heroes Swimsuit Special #1–5 (1990–1993), and The Best of Amazing Heroes Swimsuit Special (1993).
In February 1993, Fantagraphics announced that the publisher Personality Comics had bought the rights to Amazing Heroes, and planned to revive the magazine.[11] Nothing came of it, however, as Personality itself folded later that year, and by 1994 the rights had reverted back to Fantagraphics.[12]
Amazing Heroes' first 13 issues were magazine-sized, while the rest were comic book-sized.
The regular content included industry news, comics creator interviews, histories of comic book characters and reviews. Features included Hero Histories of various characters/features, previews of upcoming series, and letters page. Other regular features were a column called ""Doc's Bookshelf"" by Dwight Decker (which ran from 1987–1989),[5] and a question-and-answer feature called ""Information Center"", which ran from 1986–1989.[5]
There were regular special editions presenting previews of all comics slated to appear over the next six months, with Amazing Heroes Preview Special appearing twice a year, beginning with the Summer 1985 issue #1.[5]  These were extra-sized issues (often square-bound), and many issues also contained joke entries. The editors fluctuated between publishing these as separately numbered specials and special issues of the regular series itself, with issues #133, 145, 157, and 170 of the regular series (released in 1988 and 1989) taking the place of specials six through nine.
The Amazing Heroes Swimsuit Special, featuring pin-ups of characters in bikinis and similar beach apparel by various artists,  debuted with a June 1990 edition.[5] It was preceded by annual swimsuit issues of Amazing Heroes: #115 (April 1987), #138 (April 1988), and #164 (May 1989).
Amazing Heroes #200 (Apr. 1992) contained an extended preview of Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics; the issue was later awarded a Don Thompson Award for Best Non-Fiction Work.
From 1985 to 1987, the magazine presented The Jack Kirby Award for achievement in comic books, voted on by comic-book professionals and managed by Amazing Heroes managing editor Dave Olbrich.[13] After a dispute in 1987 over who owned them[13], the Kirby Awards were discontinued[14]. Starting in 1988, two new awards were created: the Eisner Award, managed by Olbrich, and the Fantagraphics-managed Harvey Award.
Amazing Heroes won the U.K.'s Eagle Award for Favourite Specialist Comics Publication four years in a row, from 1985 to 1988:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper),The Hill (newspaper),"
The Hill, formed in 1994, is an American newspaper and digital media company based in Washington, D.C.[4] Focusing on politics, policy, business and international relations, The Hill's coverage includes the U.S. Congress, the presidency and executive branch, and election campaigns, among other topics.[5] Its stated mission is ""nonpartisan reporting on the inner workings of government and the nexus of politics and business,"" and other sources have confirmed its reputation as a nonpartisan news organization.[6][7][8][9]
The company's primary outlet is TheHill.com. The Hill is additionally distributed in print for free around the Washington, D.C. area, and distributed to all congressional offices. It has been owned by Nexstar Media Group since 2021. In 2020, The Hill was ranked second for online politics readership across all news sites, behind only CNN, remaining ahead of Politico, Fox News, NBCNews.com, and MSNBC. As of October 2025, The Hill attracts about 42 million monthly website visits.[10][11]
The company was formed as a newspaper in 1994 by power broker and New York businessman Jerry Finkelstein,[12] and Martin Tolchin, a former correspondent for The New York Times. New York Representative Gary L. Ackerman was also a major shareholder.[4] The name of the publication alludes to ""Capitol Hill"" as a synecdoche for the United States Congress and government generally.[13]
In 2012, James A. Finkelstein assumed control of the organization.[14][1][2]
In 2016, The New York Times reported that The Hill was ""proceeding with ambitious expansion plans"" to become a national brand publication, and its website traffic increased 126% over the prior year, and was above Politico's traffic for the period.[15]
Following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, The Street reported that The Hill saw the largest increase in online political readership among political news sites, with an increase of 780%. CNN and Politico saw smaller increases over the period,[16] making The Hill ""the fastest-growing political news site"".[17] In 2017, The Hill was also cited by Twitter as one of the top 10 ""most-tweeted"" news sources.[18] A 2017 study by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University found that The Hill was the second most-shared source among supporters of Donald Trump on Twitter during the election, behind Breitbart News.[19][20]
In 2017, The Hill hired John Solomon as executive vice president of digital video.[21] Solomon inserted material from advertisers into journalistic copy, leading to protests from The Hill's publisher.[22] In March 2018, he worked closely with associates of Rudy Giuliani, the personal lawyer of U.S. President Donald Trump, to promote the spurious Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory.[22] In May 2018, Solomon's role was changed to opinion contributor, although he was allowed to keep his original title.[23] In September 2019, he left The Hill.[21]
As of 2018[update], The Hill was the second most-viewed U.S. political news website and the third-most tweeted U.S. news source.[24]
In January 2019, CNN claimed Finkelstein interfered in the editorial independence of the paper by ""keeping a watchful eye on the newspaper's coverage to ensure it is not too critical"" of President Trump.[21]
In 2019, The Hill was ranked second among all U.S. news sites for political readership, second to CNN, and ahead of Capitol Hill competitors such as Politico.[25]
In 2020, it was again ranked second for online politics readership across all news sites, behind only CNN. It remained ahead of Politico, Fox News, NBCNews.com and MSNBC.[26]
As of 2020,[update] the newspaper claims to have more than 22,000 print readers.[2] The Hill is distributed for free in newspaper boxes around the U.S. Capitol building, and mailed directly to all congressional offices.
As of 2020,[update] The Hill's YouTube channel had 1,100,000 subscribers, ahead of Politico, Axios, and Bloomberg Politics. In October 2020, The Hill's YouTube channel averaged over 1.5 million daily video views and more than 10 million per week; in September 2020 it received over 340 million video views.[27]
In 2021, The Hill was acquired by Nexstar Media Group for $130 million.[14][28]
In 2022, The Hill was accused of censorship after firing Katie Halper for a segment supporting Rashida Tlaib's labeling of Israel as an ""apartheid government"".[29] In 2024, Briahna Joy Gray was fired after appearing to roll her eyes while discussing the allegations of sexual violence against Israeli hostages during an interview with the sister of an Israeli who was abducted by Hamas in the 7 October attacks.[30][31]
Between September 2024 and September 2025, The Hill’s overall social media traffic increased by 20 percent, with the newspaper noting increased political engagement and more frequent video posting by its reporters.[32]
In June 2018, The Hill launched Hill.TV, a digital news channel. Four years later, the channel expanded to a FAST streaming service and was rebranded as The Hill TV.[33] It is distributed by Haystack, LG, Amazon Fire and Prime, Samsung, Roku, and Vizio. Programming includes Rising, a morning news program  hosted by Robby Soave four days a week (initially by Krystal Ball and Buck Sexton).[34][35] In May 2021, long-time hosts Ball and Saagar Enjeti announced they were departing in order to release their own independent project, Breaking Points with Krystal and Saagar.[36]
Since Nexstar's acquisition of The Hill, branded programming has appeared on Nexstar's cable news channel, NewsNation. Starting on April 24, 2023, The Hill appears as a weekday afternoon program on NewsNation, moderated by Leland Vittert and with panel discussion featuring Chris Stirewalt, George Will, Johanna Maska, Niall Stanage, or other rotating panelists.[37] NewsNation's chief Washington correspondent, Blake Burman, took over moderation duties in August 2023 and Mick Mulvaney and Sean Spicer joined the list of rotating panelists.[38] The Hill also airs on SiriusXM immediately following its live broadcast.
On March 3, 2024, The Hill Sunday launched. Hosted by Stirewalt, it is a Sunday morning talk show focusing on Washington politics.[39] On April 7, 2024, the show was offered to The CW network stations and local stations owned by Nexstar.[40]
The National Press Club's annual Sandy Hume Memorial Award is named after staffer Sandy Hume, in recognition of his 1997 reporting in The Hill of an attempted Republican coup against then-speaker Newt Gingrich.[41]
Climate and energy reporters Sharon Udasin and Rachel Frazin were recognized with SEAL Awards for environmental journalism in 2022 and 2023.[42][43]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Week,TV Week,"
TV Week is a weekly Australian magazine that provides television program listings information and highlights, as well as television-related news.
Content ranges from previews for upcoming storylines of popular television programs, particularly dramas, comedies, soap operas and reality shows airing in Australia, celebrity interviews, gossip and news reports about television, movies and music. A full weekly program guide with highlights is featured, as well listings for streaming services and crossword puzzles.
It was first published as a Melbourne-only publication in December 1957 (as TV-Radio Week), bearing a strong affiliation to television station Channel Nine, GTV9.[2] The publication is also well known for its association with the annual TV Week Logie Awards.
The first issue of TV-Radio Week published in Melbourne covered the week 5–11 December 1957, with popular GTV9 performers Geoff Corke and Val Ruff featured on the cover. In 1958, the title was shortened to TV Week.  Around 1956, radio magazine Listener In first published in 1925 adapted with the times and began covering television and added ""TV"" to its title.  As part of the Herald and Weekly Times (HWT) group, Listener In-TV had an affinity to the company's new television station, HSV7. The magazine was renamed TV Scene in 1976.[3]
Rival publication Television Preview, produced by the Television Owners Club of Australia, was also launched in 1957. By June 1958, the two magazines had more competition with TV News, published by the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) and a fortnight later Australian Consolidated Press (ACP) launched its own guide, TV Times.
It was thought that so many television titles in the market was unsustainable, so ACP entered into a co-publishing deal with the ABC, which saw their respective magazines merged to become TV News-Times, soon simplified to TV Times. By the end of 1958, Television Preview was incorporated into TV Week, leaving two strong rival publications in the market for the next two decades.[4]
In July 1958, TV Week added an edition in Sydney, then the only other TV market in Australia. It continued to expand publication as television launched in other capital cities and regional areas across Australia. At the close of 1958, Melbourne readers were invited to vote for their favourite TV personalities and programs, to be presented awards along with some categories judged by an industry panel. Graham Kennedy and Panda Lisner from GTV's In Melbourne Tonight were voted Melbourne's Most Popular TV personalities. Kennedy then named the awards the Logies, after the inventor of the first working television system, John Logie Baird.[5]
TV Week introduced colour internal pages in 1962, moving to gloss colour covers and internal pages in 1967. As a final evolutionary stage, the magazine doubled size from A5 to A4 in July 1968.
By 1971 TV Week had a national weekly circulation of 400,000. South Australia's TV Guide (formerly TV-Radio Tonight) attempted to launch a Melbourne edition in 1973 but only lasted for four months and later became known as TV-Radio Extra in its home state. TV Week and TV Times dominated the market across Australia. In 1979, Family Circle Publications introduced a local version of the American magazine TV Guide, in the compact A5 size.
In 1980, the ABC chose to end its agreement with TV Week and ACP purchased their interest. ACP then entered into a partnership with News Limited, leading to rival publication TV Times being incorporated into TV Week. Later that year, Family Circle Publications sold the national TV Guide to ACP and it was also incorporated into TV Week. Competition then came from existing women's magazines when The Australian Women's Weekly began including a free television magazine TV Weekly (later TV World) as an insert for its publication in May 1980. Family Circle followed suit in August 1980, as did Woman's Day with TV Day in November 1981. TV Week hit a peak circulation of 850,000 in the mid-1980s.
In 1984, the Federal Publishing Company's tabloid celebrity gossip magazine Star Enquirer was restyled to become TV Star but only ran until 1985.[6] The Victorian publication TV Scene (formerly Listener In-TV) was shut down after 62 years of publication after it was handed over to Southdown Press, following the media shake-up sparked by Rupert Murdoch's takeover of the Herald and Weekly Times Group Group. TV-Radio Extra was discontinued in South Australia in 1988 when it was incorporated into the Sunday Mail's free television guide, TV Plus. With an increasing number of these types of free magazine supplements in Sunday newspapers across the country in the 1990s, TV Week began to lose significant circulation.
In 1998, in an attempt to boost its local entertainment news credentials, Who Weekly introduced a TV supplement with television news and TV listings but by 2000 this had been dropped.
TV Week was a joint venture between Kerry Packer's Australian Consolidated Press and Southdown Press (later Pacific Publications), with the latter publishing the magazine on behalf of both parties. In 2002, Packer bought TV Week out of the joint venture, with a clause in the agreement. A legal battle over the custody of the magazine's Logie Awards followed as both Australian Consolidated Press and Pacific Publications claimed ownership. Pacific wanted to use the Logies to promote their new rival TV listing What's on Weekly but Packer won the battle and the Logies remain connected to TV Week.[2] What’s on Weekly ceased publication by the end of that year and it became the last attempt to launch a national rival to TV Week, now with a circulation of 265,000.
ACP Magazines sold TV Week and Foxtel magazine to German Bauer Media Group in 2012.[7] In 2016, another women's magazine New Idea published by Pacific Magazines, introduced TV Extra a supplement covering television news and highlights, however it did not contain TV listings.[8]
In recent years, online program guides have had a significant effect on TV Week's traditional market with circulation dropping below 200,000.[citation needed]
In 2020, Are Media acquired TV Week as part of its acquisition of Bauer Media's Australian and New Zealand assets.[1][9] Are Media promoted associate editor, Stephen Downie, to editor of the publication in 2021. Outgoing editor Amber Giles was appointed to lead the entertainment group.[10]
In 2013, TV Week received criticism from former Neighbours actress Kym Valentine for their lack of coverage of Neighbours. Valentine tweeted to TV Week, saying: ""Why don't you give Neighbours as much coverage as Home and Away? The fans are asking for it? Bring back the love xx"".[11]
TV Week Soap Extra was an Australian fortnightly television magazine, produced as a sister magazine to TV Week.[12]
In January 2014, Bauer Media published a one-off special of TV Week Soap Extra which featured exclusive teasers and first-look photos of upcoming storylines, reviews, and interviews with the stars from local and international soap operas screening in Australia, including Neighbours, Home and Away, The Bold and the Beautiful, The Young and the Restless and Days of Our Lives.[13] Other soaps included in its content were Coronation Street,[14] EastEnders,[15] Emmerdale,[16] Hollyoaks,[17] and Shortland Street.[18]
On 14 July 2014, Bauer Media confirmed that they would be launching TV Week Soap Extra as a fortnightly magazine dedicated to the storylines of Australian and overseas soaps and dramas.[19] The decision came after Bauer Media had identified a gap in the market for a contemporary magazine that covered television soaps and dramas.[20] TV Week deputy editor Erin McWhirter told TV Tonight, ""The one-off special of TV Week Soap Extra we produced and launched in January was a huge success. Off the back of that, as well as TV Week's reputation as a known and trusted brand, it was evident there was enough room in the magazine market for TV Week Soap Extra as an ongoing offering.""[20] The 66-page magazine was edited by McWhirter, published on a Thursday and cost $4.50.[19] The first issue was available from 31 July 2014.[19][21][22][23]
The final issue of Soap Extra was released on 29 October 2015.[24] Following its release, their coverage of soap operas moved back to TV Week.[25] McWhirter told TV Tonight, ""Whilst Soap Extra has attained a loyal following since launch, due to the relative size of the soap market the business decision has been made that the popular content from Soap Extra is better placed within TV Week.[26]
TV Week Close Up is an Australian monthly television magazine, produced as a sister magazine to TV Week.[27]
On 2 August 2018, Bauer Media launched TV Week Close Up as a monthly magazine dedicated to interviews with stars and industry power brokers and behind the scenes stories about Australia's most popular TV shows. TV Week editor Thomas Woodgate told Mumbrella, ""TV Week has earned the trust of our best talent over many years, and we have unrivalled access to Australian stars and shows. It's this access that we want to be able to share every month. We want to provide more of what we know readers love, which is in-depth chats, photo shoots with the stars, exclusive behind- the-scenes looks at favourite shows, and nostalgic trips down TV memory lane"".[28] The magazine was sold at a special launch price of $2.99 but normally sells for $5.99.

The New York Times (NYT)[b] is a newspaper based in New York City. The New York Times covers domestic, national, and international news, and publishes opinion pieces and reviews. As one of the longest-running newspapers in the United States, the Times serves as one of the country's newspapers of record. As of August 2025[update], The New York Times had 11.88 million total and 11.3 million online subscribers, both by significant margins the highest numbers for any newspaper in the United States; the total also included 580,000 print subscribers. The New York Times is published by the New York Times Company; since 1896, the company has been chaired by the Ochs-Sulzberger family, whose current chairman and the paper's publisher is A. G. Sulzberger. The Times is headquartered at The New York Times Building in Midtown Manhattan.
The Times was founded as the conservative New-York Daily Times in 1851, and came to national recognition in the 1870s with its aggressive coverage of corrupt politician Boss Tweed. Following the Panic of 1893, Chattanooga Times publisher Adolph Ochs gained a controlling interest in the company. In 1935, Ochs was succeeded by his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, who began a push into European news. Sulzberger's son Arthur Ochs Sulzberger became publisher in 1963, adapting to a changing newspaper industry and introducing radical changes. The New York Times was involved in the landmark 1964 U.S. Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, which restricted the ability of public officials to sue the media for defamation.
In 1971, The New York Times published the Pentagon Papers, an internal Department of Defense document detailing the United States's historical involvement in the Vietnam War, despite pushback from then-president Richard Nixon. In the landmark decision New York Times Co. v. United States (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment guaranteed the right to publish the Pentagon Papers. In the 1980s, the Times began a two-decade progression to digital technology and launched nytimes.com in 1996. In the 21st century, it shifted its publication online amid the global decline of newspapers.
Currently, the Times maintains several regional bureaus staffed with journalists across six continents. It has expanded to several other publications, including The New York Times Magazine, The New York Times International Edition, and The New York Times Book Review. In addition, the paper has produced several television series, podcasts—including The Daily—and games through The New York Times Games.
The New York Times has been involved in a number of controversies in its history. Among other accolades, it has been awarded the Pulitzer Prize 135 times since 1918, the most of any publication.
The New York Times was established in 1851 as the New-York Daily Times by New-York Tribune journalists Henry Jarvis Raymond and George Jones.[4] The Times experienced significant circulation, particularly among conservatives; New-York Tribune publisher Horace Greeley praised the Times.[5] During the American Civil War, Times correspondents gathered information directly from Confederate states.[6] In 1869, Jones inherited the paper from Raymond,[7] who had changed its name to The New-York Times.[8] Under Jones, the Times began to publish a series of articles criticizing Tammany Hall political boss William M. Tweed, despite vehement opposition from other New York newspapers.[9] In 1871, The New-York Times published Tammany Hall's accounting books; Tweed was tried in 1873 and sentenced to twelve years in prison. The Times earned national recognition for its coverage of Tweed.[10] In 1891, Jones died, creating a management imbroglio in which his children had insufficient business acumen to inherit the company and his will prevented an acquisition of the Times.[11] Editor-in-chief Charles Ransom Miller, editorial editor Edward Cary, and correspondent George F. Spinney established a company to manage The New-York Times,[12] but faced financial difficulties during the Panic of 1893.[13]
In August 1896, Chattanooga Times publisher Adolph Ochs acquired The New-York Times, implementing significant alterations to the newspaper's structure. Ochs established the Times as a merchant's newspaper and removed the hyphen from the newspaper's name.[14] In 1905, The New York Times opened Times Tower, marking expansion.[15] The Times experienced a political realignment in the 1910s amid several disagreements within the Republican Party.[16] The New York Times reported on the sinking of the Titanic, as other newspapers were cautious about bulletins circulated by the Associated Press.[17] Through managing editor Carr Van Anda, the Times focused on scientific advancements, reporting on Albert Einstein's then-unknown theory of general relativity and becoming involved in the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun.[18] In April 1935, Ochs died, leaving his son-in-law Arthur Hays Sulzberger as publisher.[19] The Great Depression forced Sulzberger to reduce The New York Times's operations,[20] and developments in the New York newspaper landscape resulted in the formation of larger newspapers, such as the New York Herald Tribune and the New York World-Telegram.[21] In contrast to Ochs, Sulzberger encouraged wirephotography.[22]
The New York Times extensively covered World War II through large headlines,[23] reporting on exclusive stories such as the Yugoslav coup d'état.[24] Amid the war, Sulzberger began expanding the Times's operations further, acquiring WQXR-FM in 1944—the first non-Times investment since the Jones era—and established a fashion show in Times Hall. Despite reductions as a result of conscription, The New York Times retained the largest journalism staff of any newspaper.[25] The Times's print edition became available internationally during the war through the Army & Air Force Exchange Service; The New York Times Overseas Weekly later became available in Japan through The Asahi Shimbun and in Germany through the Frankfurter Zeitung. The international edition would develop into a separate newspaper.[26] Journalist William L. Laurence publicized the atomic bomb race between the United States and Germany, resulting in the Federal Bureau of Investigation seizing copies of the Times. The United States government recruited Laurence to document the Manhattan Project in April 1945.[27] Laurence became the only witness of the Manhattan Project, a detail realized by employees of The New York Times following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.[28]
Following World War II, The New York Times continued to expand.[29] The Times was subject to investigations from the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, a McCarthyist subcommittee that investigated purported communism from within press institutions. Arthur Hays Sulzberger's decision to dismiss a copyreader who had pleaded the Fifth Amendment drew ire from within the Times and from external organizations.[30] In April 1961, Sulzberger resigned, appointing his son-in-law, The New York Times Company president Orvil Dryfoos.[31] Under Dryfoos, The New York Times established a newspaper based in Los Angeles.[32] In 1962, the implementation of automated printing presses in response to increasing costs mounted fears over technological unemployment. The New York Typographical Union staged a strike in December, altering the media consumption of New Yorkers. The strike left New York with three remaining newspapers—the Times, the Daily News, and the New York Post—by its conclusion in March 1963.[33] In May, Dryfoos died of a heart ailment.[34] Following weeks of ambiguity, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger became The New York Times's publisher.[35]
Technological advancements leveraged by newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times and improvements in coverage from The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal necessitated adaptations to nascent computing.[36] The New York Times published ""Heed Their Rising Voices"" in 1960, a full-page advertisement purchased by supporters of Martin Luther King Jr. criticizing law enforcement in Montgomery, Alabama for their response to the civil rights movement. Montgomery Public Safety commissioner L. B. Sullivan sued the Times for defamation. In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the verdict in Alabama county court and the Supreme Court of Alabama violated the First Amendment.[37] The decision is considered to be landmark.[38] After financial losses, The New York Times ended its international edition, acquiring a stake in the Paris Herald Tribune, forming the International Herald Tribune.[39] The Times initially published the Pentagon Papers, facing opposition from then-president Richard Nixon. The Supreme Court ruled in The New York Times's favor in New York Times Co. v. United States (1971), allowing the Times and The Washington Post to publish the papers.[40]
The New York Times remained cautious in its initial coverage of the Watergate scandal.[41] As Congress began investigating the scandal, the Times furthered its coverage,[42] publishing details on the Huston Plan, alleged wiretapping of reporters and officials,[43] and testimony from James W. McCord Jr. that the Committee for the Re-Election of the President paid the conspirators off.[44] The exodus of readers to suburban New York newspapers, such as Newsday and Gannett papers, adversely affected The New York Times's circulation.[45] Contemporary newspapers balked at additional sections; Time devoted a cover for its criticism and New York wrote that the Times was engaging in ""middle-class self-absorption"".[46] The New York Times, the Daily News, and the New York Post were the subject of a strike in 1978,[47] allowing emerging newspapers to leverage halted coverage.[48] The Times deliberately avoided coverage of the AIDS epidemic, running its first front-page article in May 1983. Max Frankel's editorial coverage of the epidemic, with mentions of anal intercourse, contrasted with then-executive editor A. M. Rosenthal's puritan approach, intentionally avoiding descriptions of the luridity of gay venues.[49]
Following years of waning interest in The New York Times, Sulzberger resigned in January 1992, appointing his son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., as publisher.[50] The Internet represented a generational shift within the Times; Sulzberger, who negotiated The New York Times Company's acquisition of The Boston Globe in 1993, derided the Internet, while his son expressed antithetical views. @times appeared on America Online's website in May 1994 as an extension of The New York Times, featuring news articles, film reviews, sports news, and business articles.[51] Despite opposition, several employees of the Times had begun to access the Internet.[52] The online success of publications that traditionally co-existed with the Times—such as America Online, Yahoo, and CNN—and the expansion of websites such as Monster.com and Craigslist that threatened The New York Times's classified advertisement model increased efforts to develop a website.[53] nytimes.com debuted on January 19 and was formally announced three days later.[54] The Times published domestic terrorist Ted Kaczynski's essay Industrial Society and Its Future in 1995, contributing to his arrest after his brother David recognized the essay's penmanship.[55]
Following the establishment of nytimes.com, The New York Times retained its journalistic hesitancy under executive editor Joseph Lelyveld, refusing to publish an article reporting on the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal from Drudge Report. nytimes.com editors conflicted with print editors on several occasions, including wrongfully naming security guard Richard Jewell as the suspect in the Centennial Olympic Park bombing and covering the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in greater detail than the print edition.[56] The New York Times Electronic Media Company was adversely affected by the dot-com crash.[57] The Times extensively covered the September 11 attacks. The following day's print issue contained sixty-six articles,[58] the work of over three hundred dispatched reporters.[59] Journalist Judith Miller was the recipient of a package containing a white powder during the 2001 anthrax attacks, furthering anxiety within The New York Times.[60] In September 2002, Miller and military correspondent Michael R. Gordon wrote an article for the Times claiming that Iraq had purchased aluminum tubes. The article was cited by then-president George W. Bush to claim that Iraq was constructing weapons of mass destruction; the theoretical use of aluminum tubes to produce nuclear material was speculation.[61] In March 2003, the United States invaded Iraq, beginning the Iraq War.[62]
The New York Times attracted controversy after thirty-six articles[63] from journalist Jayson Blair were discovered to be plagiarized.[64] Criticism over then-executive editor Howell Raines and then-managing editor Gerald M. Boyd mounted following the scandal, culminating in a town hall in which a deputy editor criticized Raines for failing to question Blair's sources in article he wrote on the D.C. sniper attacks.[65] In June 2003, Raines and Boyd resigned.[66] Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. appointed Bill Keller as executive editor.[67] Miller continued to report on the Iraq War as a journalistic embed covering the country's weapons of mass destruction program. Keller and then-Washington bureau chief Jill Abramson unsuccessfully attempted to subside criticism. Conservative media criticized the Times over its coverage of missing explosives from the Al Qa'qaa weapons facility.[68] An article in December 2005 disclosing warrantless surveillance by the National Security Agency contributed to further criticism from the George W. Bush administration and the Senate's refusal to renew the Patriot Act.[69] In the Plame affair, a Central Intelligence Agency inquiry found that Miller had become aware of Valerie Plame's identity through then-vice president Dick Cheney's chief of staff Scooter Libby, resulting in Miller's resignation.[70]
During the Great Recession, The New York Times suffered significant fiscal difficulties as a consequence of the subprime mortgage crisis and a decline in classified advertising.[71] Exacerbated by Rupert Murdoch's revitalization of The Wall Street Journal through his acquisition of Dow Jones & Company, The New York Times Company began enacting measures to reduce the newsroom budget. The company was forced to borrow $250 million (equivalent to $365.11 million in 2024) from Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim and fired over one hundred employees by 2010.[72] nytimes.com's coverage of the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal, resulting in the resignation of then-New York governor Eliot Spitzer, furthered the legitimacy of the website as a journalistic medium.[73] The Times's economic downturn renewed discussions of an online paywall;[74] The New York Times implemented a paywall in March 2011.[75] Abramson succeeded Keller,[76] continuing her characteristic investigations into corporate and government malfeasance into the Times's coverage.[77] Following conflicts with newly appointed chief executive Mark Thompson's ambitions,[78] Abramson was dismissed by Sulzberger Jr., who named Dean Baquet as her replacement.[79]
Leading up to the 2016 presidential election, The New York Times elevated the Hillary Clinton email controversy into a national issue.[80] Donald Trump's upset victory contributed to an increase in subscriptions to the Times.[81] The New York Times experienced unprecedented indignation from Trump, who referred to publications such as the Times as ""enemies of the people"" at the Conservative Political Action Conference and tweeted his disdain for the newspaper and CNN.[82] In October 2017, The New York Times published an article by journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey alleging that dozens of women had accused film producer and The Weinstein Company co-chairman Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct.[83] The investigation resulted in Weinstein's resignation and conviction,[84] precipitated the Weinstein effect,[85] and served as a catalyst for the #MeToo movement.[86] The New York Times Company vacated the public editor position[87] and eliminated the copy desk in November.[88] Sulzberger Jr. announced his resignation in December 2017, appointing his son, A. G. Sulzberger, as publisher.[89]
Trump's relationship—equally diplomatic and negative—marked Sulzberger's tenure.[90] In September 2018, The New York Times published ""I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration"", an anonymous essay by a self-described Trump administration official later revealed to be Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor.[91] The animosity—which extended to nearly three hundred instances of Trump disparaging the Times by May 2019[92]—culminated in Trump ordering federal agencies to cancel their subscriptions to The New York Times and The Washington Post in October 2019.[93] Trump's tax returns have been the subject of three separate investigations.[c] During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Times began implementing data services and graphs.[97] On May 23, 2020, The New York Times's front page solely featured U.S. Deaths Near 100,000, An Incalculable Loss, a subset of the 100,000 people in the United States who died of COVID-19, the first time that the Times's front page lacked images since they were introduced.[98] Since 2020, The New York Times has focused on broader diversification, developing online games and producing television series.[99] The New York Times Company acquired The Athletic in January 2022.[100]
Since 1896, The New York Times has been published by the Ochs-Sulzberger family, having previously been published by Henry Jarvis Raymond until 1869[101] and by George Jones until 1896.[102] Adolph Ochs published the Times until his death in 1935,[103] when he was succeeded by his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger. Sulzberger was publisher until 1961[104] and was succeeded by Orvil Dryfoos, his son-in-law, who served in the position until his death in 1963.[105] Arthur Ochs Sulzberger succeeded Dryfoos until his resignation in 1992.[106] His son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., served as publisher until 2018. The New York Times's current publisher is A. G. Sulzberger, Sulzberger Jr.'s son.[89] As of 2023, the Times's executive editor is Joseph Kahn[107] and the paper's managing editors are Marc Lacey and Carolyn Ryan, having been appointed in June 2022.[108] The New York Times's deputy managing editors are Sam Dolnick,[109] Monica Drake,[110] and Steve Duenes,[111] and the paper's assistant managing editors are Matthew Ericson,[112] Jonathan Galinsky, Hannah Poferl, Sam Sifton, Karron Skog,[113] and Michael Slackman.[114]
The New York Times is owned by The New York Times Company, a publicly traded company. The New York Times Company, in addition to the Times, owns Wirecutter, The Athletic, The New York Times Cooking, and The New York Times Games, and acquired Serial Productions and Audm. The New York Times Company holds undisclosed minority investments in multiple other businesses, and formerly owned The Boston Globe and several radio and television stations.[115] The New York Times Company is majority-owned by the Ochs-Sulzberger family through elevated shares in the company's dual-class stock structure held largely in a trust, in effect since the 1950s;[116] as of 2022, the family holds ninety-five percent of The New York Times Company's Class B shares, allowing it to elect seventy percent of the company's board of directors.[117] Class A shareholders have restrictive voting rights.[118] As of 2023, The New York Times Company's chief executive is Meredith Kopit Levien, the company's former chief operating officer who was appointed in September 2020.[119]
As of March 2023, The New York Times Company employs 5,800 individuals,[99] including 1,700 journalists according to deputy managing editor Sam Dolnick.[120] Journalists for The New York Times may not run for public office, provide financial support to political candidates or causes, endorse candidates, or demonstrate public support for causes or movements.[121] Journalists are subject to the guidelines established in ""Ethical Journalism"" and ""Guidelines on Integrity"".[122] According to the former, Times journalists must abstain from using sources with a personal relationship to them and must not accept reimbursements or inducements from individuals who may be written about in The New York Times, with exceptions for gifts of nominal value.[123] The latter requires attribution and exact quotations, though exceptions are made for linguistic anomalies. Staff writers are expected to ensure the veracity of all written claims, but may delegate researching obscure facts to the research desk.[124] In March 2021, the Times established a committee to avoid journalistic conflicts of interest with work written for The New York Times, following columnist David Brooks's resignation from the Aspen Institute for his undisclosed work on the initiative Weave.[125]
The New York Times editorial board was established in 1896 by Adolph Ochs. With the opinion department, the editorial board is independent of the newsroom.[165] Then-editor-in-chief Charles Ransom Miller served as opinion editor from 1883 until his death in 1922.[166] Rollo Ogden succeeded Miller until his death in 1937.[167] From 1937 to 1938, John Huston Finley served as opinion editor; in a prearranged plan, Charles Merz succeeded Finley.[168] Merz served in the position until his retirement in 1961.[169] John Bertram Oakes served as opinion editor from 1961 to 1976, when then-publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger appointed Max Frankel.[170] Frankel served in the position until 1986, when he was appointed as executive editor.[171] Jack Rosenthal was the opinion editor from 1986 to 1993.[172] Howell Raines succeeded Rosenthal until 2001, when he was made executive editor.[173] Gail Collins succeeded Raines until her resignation in 2006.[174] From 2007 to 2016, Andrew Rosenthal was the opinion editor.[175] James Bennet succeeded Rosenthal until his resignation in 2020.[176] As of July 2024[update], the editorial board comprises thirteen opinion writers.[177] The New York Times's opinion editor is Kathleen Kingsbury[178] and the deputy opinion editor is Patrick Healy.[113]
The New York Times's editorial board was initially opposed to liberal beliefs, opposing women's suffrage in 1900 and 1914. The editorial board began to espouse progressive beliefs during Oakes' tenure, conflicting with the Ochs-Sulzberger family, of which Oakes was a member as Adolph Ochs's nephew; in 1976, Oakes publicly disagreed with Sulzberger's endorsement of Daniel Patrick Moynihan over Bella Abzug in the 1976 Senate Democratic primaries in a letter sent from Martha's Vineyard. Under Rosenthal, the editorial board took positions supporting assault weapons legislation and the legalization of marijuana, but publicly criticized the Obama administration over its portrayal of terrorism.[175] In presidential elections, The New York Times has endorsed a total of twelve Republican candidates and thirty-two Democratic candidates, and has endorsed the Democrat in every election since 1960.[179][180][j] With the exception of Wendell Willkie, Republicans endorsed by the Times have won the presidency. In 2016, the editorial board issued an anti-endorsement against Donald Trump for the first time in its history.[181] In February 2020, the editorial board reduced its presence from several editorials each day to occasional editorials for events deemed particularly significant. Since August 2024, the board no longer endorses candidates in local or congressional races in New York.[182]
Since 1940, editorial, media, and technology workers of The New York Times have been represented by the New York Times Guild. The Times Guild, along with the Times Tech Guild, are represented by the NewsGuild-CWA.[183] In 1940, Arthur Hays Sulzberger was called upon by the National Labor Relations Board amid accusations that he had discouraged Guild membership in the Times. Over the next few years, the Guild would ratify several contracts, expanding to editorial and news staff in 1942 and maintenance workers in 1943.[184]
The New York Times Guild has walked out several times in its history, including for six and a half hours in 1981[185] and in 2017, when copy editors and reporters walked out at lunchtime in response to the elimination of the copy desk.[186] On December 7, 2022, the union held a one-day strike,[187] the first interruption to The New York Times since 1978.[188] The New York Times Guild reached an agreement in May 2023 to increase minimum salaries for employees and a retroactive bonus.[189] The Times Tech Guild is the largest technology union with collective bargaining rights in the United States.[190] The guild held a second strike beginning on November 4, 2024, threatening the Times's coverage of the 2024 United States presidential election.[191]
As of August 2025, The New York Times has 11.8 million subscribers, with 11.3 million online-only subscribers and 580,000 print subscribers.[192] The New York Times Company intends to have 15 million subscribers by 2027.[192] The Times's shift towards subscription-based revenue with the debut of an online paywall in 2011 contributed to subscription revenue exceeding advertising revenue the following year, furthered by the 2016 presidential election and Donald Trump.[193] In 2022, Vox wrote that The New York Times's subscribers skew ""older, richer, whiter, and more liberal""; to reflect the general population of the United States, the Times has attempted to alter its audience by acquiring The Athletic, investing in verticals such as The New York Times Games, and beginning a marketing campaign showing diverse subscribers to the Times. The New York Times Company chief executive Meredith Kopit Levien stated that the average age of subscribers has remained constant.[194]
In October 2001, The New York Times began publishing DealBook, a financial newsletter edited by Andrew Ross Sorkin. The Times had intended to publish the newsletter in September, but delayed its debut following the September 11 attacks.[195] A website for DealBook was established in March 2006.[196] The New York Times began shifting towards DealBook as part of the newspaper's financial coverage in November 2010 with a renewed website and a presence in the Times's print edition.[197] In 2011, the Times began hosting the DealBook Summit, an annual conference hosted by Sorkin.[198] During the COVID-19 pandemic, The New York Times hosted the DealBook Online Summit in 2020[199] and 2021.[200] The 2022 DealBook Summit featured—among other speakers—former vice president Mike Pence and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu,[201] culminating in an interview with former FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried; FTX had filed for bankruptcy several weeks prior.[202] The 2023 DealBook Summit's speakers included vice president Kamala Harris, Israeli president Isaac Herzog, and businessman Elon Musk.[198]
In June 2010, The New York Times licensed the political blog FiveThirtyEight in a three-year agreement.[203] The blog, written by Nate Silver, had garnered attention during the 2008 presidential election for predicting the elections in forty-nine of fifty states. FiveThirtyEight appeared on nytimes.com in August.[204] According to Silver, several offers were made for the blog; Silver wrote that a merger of unequals must allow for editorial sovereignty and resources from the acquirer, comparing himself to Groucho Marx.[205] According to The New Republic, FiveThirtyEight drew as much as a fifth of the traffic to nytimes.com during the 2012 presidential election.[206] In July 2013, FiveThirtyEight was sold to ESPN.[207] In an article following Silver's exit, public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote that he was disruptive to the Times's culture for his perspective on probability-based predictions and scorn for polling—having stated that punditry is ""fundamentally useless"", comparing him to Billy Beane, who implemented sabermetrics in baseball. According to Sullivan, his work was criticized by several notable political journalists.[208]
The New Republic obtained a memo in November 2013 revealing then-Washington bureau chief David Leonhardt's ambitions to establish a data-driven newsletter with presidential historian Michael Beschloss, graphic designer Amanda Cox, economist Justin Wolfers, and The New Republic journalist Nate Cohn.[209] By March, Leonhardt had amassed fifteen employees from within The New York Times; the newsletter's staff included individuals who had created the Times's dialect quiz, fourth down analyzer, and a calculator for determining buying or renting a home.[210] The Upshot debuted in April 2014.[211] Fast Company reviewed an article about Illinois Secure Choice—a state-funded retirement saving system—as ""neither a terse news item, nor a formal financial advice column, nor a politically charged response to economic policy"", citing its informal and neutral tone.[212] The Upshot developed ""the needle"" for the 2016 presidential election and 2020 presidential elections, a thermometer dial displaying the probability of a candidate winning.[213] In January 2016, Cox was named editor of The Upshot.[214] Kevin Quealy was named editor in June 2022.[215]
The New York Times has said it is perceived as a liberal newspaper.[216] An analysis by Pew Research Center in October 2014 placed the Times readership as ideologically liberal based on a scale of 10 political values questions.[217] According to an internal readership poll conducted by The New York Times in 2019, eighty-four percent of readers identified as liberal.[218] The New York Times has struggled internally with how to balance its coverage, dismissing criticism from the left for ""sanewashing"" conservative viewpoints.[219]
In covering Israel's war on the Gaza Strip, The New York Times instructed its reporters not to use the words Palestine and Genocide, or refer to refugee camps, with data analysis showing a pattern of articles emphasizing Israeli civilians killed by Palestinians over a much larger number of Palestinian civilians killed by Israelis.[220] The group Writers Against the War on Gaza (writing in the blog Mondoweiss has contrasted this with The New York Times coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in which Russia is considered a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests where Israel is considered an ally.[221]
In February 1942, The New York Times crossword debuted in The New York Times Magazine; according to Richard Shepard, the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 convinced then-publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger of the necessity of a crossword.[222]
The New York Times has published recipes since the 1850s and has had a separate food section since the 1940s.[223] In 1961, restaurant critic Craig Claiborne published The New York Times Cookbook,[224] an unauthorized cookbook that drew from the Times's recipes.[225] Since 2010, former food editor Amanda Hesser has published The Essential New York Times Cookbook, a compendium of recipes from The New York Times.[226] The Innovation Report in 2014 revealed that the Times had attempted to establish a cooking website since 1998, but faced difficulties with the absence of a defined data structure.[227] In September 2014, The New York Times introduced NYT Cooking, an application and website.[228] Edited by food editor Sam Sifton,[225] the Times's cooking website features 21,000 recipes as of 2022.[229] NYT Cooking features videos as part of an effort by Sifton to hire two former Tasty employees from BuzzFeed.[225] In August 2023, NYT Cooking added personalized recommendations through the cosine similarity of text embeddings of recipe titles.[230] The website also features no-recipe recipes, a concept proposed by Sifton.[231]
In May 2016, The New York Times Company announced a partnership with startup Chef'd to form a meal delivery service that would deliver ingredients from The New York Times Cooking recipes to subscribers;[232] Chef'd shut down in July 2018 after failing to accrue capital and secure financing.[233] The Hollywood Reporter reported in September 2022 that the Times would expand its delivery options to US$95 cooking kits curated by chefs such as Nina Compton, Chintan Pandya, and Naoko Takei Moore. That month, the staff of NYT Cooking went on tour with Compton, Pandya, and Moore in Los Angeles, New Orleans, and New York City, culminating in a food festival.[234] In addition, The New York Times offered its own wine club originally operated by the Global Wine Company. The New York Times Wine Club was established in August 2009, during a dramatic decrease in advertising revenue.[235] By 2021, the wine club was managed by Lot18, a company that provides proprietary labels. Lot18 managed the Williams Sonoma Wine Club and its own wine club Tasting Room.[236]

The New York Times archives its articles in a basement annex beneath its building known as ""the morgue"", a venture started by managing editor Carr Van Anda in 1907. The morgue comprises news clippings, a pictures library, and the Times's book and periodicals library. As of 2014, it is the largest library of any media company, dating back to 1851.[237] In November 2018, The New York Times partnered with Google to digitize the Archival Library.[238] Additionally, The New York Times has maintained a virtual microfilm reader known as TimesMachine since 2014. The service launched with archives from 1851 to 1980; in 2016, TimesMachine expanded to include archives from 1981 to 2002. The Times built a pipeline to take in TIFF images, article metadata in XML and an INI file of Cartesian geometry describing the boundaries of the page, and convert it into a PNG of image tiles and JSON containing the information in the XML and INI files. The image tiles are generated using GDAL and displayed using Leaflet, using data from a content delivery network. The Times ran optical character recognition on the articles using Tesseract and shingled and fuzzy string matched the result.[239]
The New York Times uses a proprietary[240] content management system known as Scoop for its online content and the Microsoft Word-based content management system CCI for its print content. Scoop was developed in 2008 to serve as a secondary content management system for editors working in CCI to publish their content on the Times's website; as part of The New York Times's online endeavors, editors now write their content in Scoop and send their work to CCI for print publication. Since its introduction, Scoop has superseded several processes within the Times, including print edition planning and collaboration, and features tools such as multimedia integration, notifications, content tagging, and drafts. The New York Times uses private articles for high-profile opinion pieces, such as those written by Russian president Vladimir Putin and actress Angelina Jolie, and for high-level investigations.[241] In January 2012, the Times released Integrated Content Editor (ICE), a revision tracking tool for WordPress and TinyMCE. ICE is integrated within the Times's workflow by providing a unified text editor for print and online editors, reducing the divide between print and online operations.[242]
By 2017,[243] The New York Times began developing a new authoring tool to its content management system known as Oak, in an attempt to further the Times's visual efforts in articles and reduce the discrepancy between the mediums in print and online articles.[244] The system reduces the input of editors and supports additional visual mediums in an editor that resembles the appearance of the article.[243] Oak is based on ProseMirror, a JavaScript rich-text editor toolkit, and retains the revision tracking and commenting functionalities of The New York Times's previous systems. Additionally, Oak supports predefined article headers.[245] In 2019, Oak was updated to support collaborative editing using Firebase to update editors's cursor status. Several Google Cloud Functions and Google Cloud Tasks allow articles to be previewed as they will be printed, and the Times's primary MySQL database is regularly updated to update editors on the article status.[246]
Since 1895, The New York Times has maintained a manual of style in several forms. The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage was published on the Times's intranet in 1999.[247]
The New York Times uses honorifics when referring to individuals. With the AP Stylebook's removal of honorifics in 2000 and The Wall Street Journal's omission of courtesy titles in May 2023, the Times is the only national newspaper that continues to use honorifics. According to former copy editor Merrill Perlman, The New York Times continues to use honorifics as a ""sign of civility"".[248] The Times's use of courtesy titles led to an apocryphal rumor that the paper had referred to singer Meat Loaf as ""Mr. Loaf"".[249] Several exceptions have been made; the former sports section and The New York Times Book Review do not use honorifics.[250] A leaked memo following the killing of Osama bin Laden in May 2011 revealed that editors were given a last-minute instruction to omit the honorific from Osama bin Laden's name, consistent with deceased figures of historic significance, such as Adolf Hitler, Napoleon, and Vladimir Lenin.[251] The New York Times uses academic and military titles for individuals prominently serving in that position.[252] In 1986, the Times began to use Ms.,[250] and introduced the gender-neutral title Mx. in 2015.[253] The New York Times uses initials when a subject has expressed a preference, such as Donald Trump.[254]
The New York Times maintains a strict but not absolute obscenity policy, including phrases. In a review of the Canadian hardcore punk band Fucked Up, music critic Kelefa Sanneh wrote that the band's name—entirely rendered in asterisks—would not be printed in the Times ""unless an American president, or someone similar, says it by mistake"";[255] The New York Times did not repeat then-vice president Dick Cheney's use of ""fuck"" against then-senator Patrick Leahy in 2004[256] or then-vice president Joe Biden's remarks that the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 was a ""big fucking deal"".[257] The Times's profanity policy has been tested by former president Donald Trump. The New York Times published Trump's Access Hollywood tape in October 2016, containing the words ""fuck"", ""pussy"", ""bitch"", and ""tits"", the first time the publication had published an expletive on its front page,[258] and repeated an explicit phrase for fellatio stated by then-White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci in July 2017.[259] The New York Times omitted Trump's use of the phrase ""shithole countries"" from its headline in favor of ""vulgar language"" in January 2018.[260] The Times banned certain words, such as ""bitch"", ""whore"", and ""sluts"", from Wordle in 2022.[261]
Journalists for The New York Times do not write their own headlines, but rather copy editors who specifically write headlines. The Times's guidelines insist headline editors get to the main point of an article but avoid giving away endings, if present. Other guidelines include using slang ""sparingly"", avoiding tabloid headlines, not ending a line on a preposition, article, or adjective, and chiefly, not to pun. The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage states that wordplay, such as ""Rubber Industry Bounces Back"", is to be tested on a colleague as a canary is to be tested in a coal mine; ""when no song bursts forth, start rewriting"".[262] The New York Times has amended headlines due to controversy. In 2019, following two back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, the Times used the headline, ""Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism"", to describe then-president Donald Trump's words after the shootings. After criticism from FiveThirtyEight founder Nate Silver, the headline was changed to, ""Assailing Hate But Not Guns"".[263]
Online, The New York Times's headlines do not face the same length restrictions as headlines that appear in print; print headlines must fit within a column, often six words. Additionally, headlines must ""break"" properly, containing a complete thought on each line without splitting up prepositions and adverbs. Writers may edit a headline to fit an article more aptly if further developments occur. The Times uses A/B testing for articles on the front page, placing two headlines against each other. At the end of the test, the headlines that receives more traffic is chosen.[264] The alteration of a headline regarding intercepted Russian data used in the Mueller special counsel investigation was noted by Trump in a March 2017 interview with Time, in which he claimed that the headline used the word ""wiretapped"" in the print version of the paper on January 20, while the digital article on January 19 omitted the word. The headline was intentionally changed in the print version to use ""wiretapped"" in order to fit within the print guidelines.[265]
The nameplate of The New York Times has been unaltered since 1967. In creating the initial nameplate, Henry Jarvis Raymond took as his model the British newspaper The Times, which used a Blackletter style called Textura, popularized following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and regional variations of Alcuin's script, as well as a period. With the change to The New-York Times on September 14, 1857, the nameplate followed. Under George Jones, the terminals of the ""N"", ""r"", and ""s"" were intentionally exaggerated into swashes. The nameplate in the January 15, 1894, issue trimmed the terminals once more, smoothed the edges, and turned the stem supporting the ""T"" into an ornament. The hyphen was dropped on December 1, 1896, after Adolph Ochs purchased the paper. The descender of the ""h"" was shortened on December 30, 1914. The largest change to the nameplate was introduced on February 21, 1967, when type designer Ed Benguiat redesigned the logo, most prominently turning the arrow ornament into a diamond. Notoriously, the new logo dropped the period that had followed the word Times up until that point; one reader compared the omission of the period to ""performing plastic surgery on Helen of Troy."" Picture editor John Radosta worked with a New York University professor to determine that dropping the period saved the paper US$41.28 (equivalent to $389.28 in 2024).[266]
As of December 2023, The New York Times has printed sixty thousand issues, a statistic represented in the paper's masthead to the right of the volume number, the Times's years in publication written in Roman numerals.[267] The volume and issues are separated by four dots representing the edition number of that issue; on the day of the 2000 presidential election, the Times was revised four separate times, necessitating the use of an em dash in place of an ellipsis.[268] The em dash issue was printed hundreds times over before being replaced by the one-dot issue. Despite efforts by newsroom employees to recycle copies sent to The New York Times's office, several copies were kept, including one put on display at the Museum at The Times.[269] From February 7, 1898, to December 31, 1999, the Times's issue number was incorrect by five hundred issues, an error suspected by The Atlantic to be the result of a careless front page type editor. The misreporting was noticed by news editor Aaron Donovan, who was calculating the number of issues in a spreadsheet and noticed the discrepancy. The New York Times celebrated fifty thousand issues on March 14, 1995, an observance that should have occurred on July 26, 1996.[270]
The New York Times has reduced the physical size of its print edition while retaining its broadsheet format. The New-York Daily Times debuted at 18 inches (460 mm) across. By the 1950s, the Times was being printed at 16 inches (410 mm) across. In 1953, an increase in paper costs to US$10 (equivalent to $117.52 in 2024) a ton increased newsprint costs to US$21.7 million (equivalent to $318,492,412.94 in 2024) On December 28, 1953, the pages were reduced to 15.5 inches (390 mm). On February 14, 1955, a further reduction to 15 inches (380 mm) occurred, followed by 14.5 and 13.5 inches (370 and 340 mm). On August 6, 2007, the largest cut occurred when the pages were reduced to 12 inches (300 mm),[k] a decision that other broadsheets had previously considered. Then-executive editor Bill Keller stated that a narrower paper would be more beneficial to the reader but acknowledged a net loss in article space of five percent.[271] In 1985, The New York Times Company established a minority stake in a US$21.7 million (equivalent to $318,492,412.94 in 2024) newsprint plant in Clermont, Quebec through Donahue Malbaie.[272] The company sold its equity interest in Donahue Malbaie in 2017.[273]
The New York Times often uses large, bolded headlines for major events. For the print version of the Times, these headlines are written by one copy editor, reviewed by two other copy editors, approved by the masthead editors, and polished by other print editors. The process is completed before 8 p.m., but it may be repeated if further development occur, as did take place during the 2020 presidential election. On the day Joe Biden was declared the winner, The New York Times utilized a ""hammer headline"" reading, ""Biden Beats Trump"", in all caps and bolded. A dozen journalists discussed several potential headlines, such as ""It's Biden"" or ""Biden's Moment"", and prepared for a Donald Trump victory, in which they would use ""Trump Prevails"".[274] During Trump's first impeachment, the Times drafted the hammer headline, ""Trump Impeached"". The New York Times altered the ligatures between the E and the A, as not doing so would leave a noticeable gap due to the stem of the A sloping away from the E. The Times reused the tight kerning for ""Biden Beats Trump"" and Trump's second impeachment, which simply read, ""Impeached"".[275]
In cases where two major events occur on the same day or immediately after each other, The New York Times has used a ""paddle wheel"" headline, where both headlines are used but split by a line. The term dates back to August 8, 1959, when it was revealed that the United States was monitoring Soviet missile firings and when Explorer 6—shaped like a paddle wheel—launched. Since then, the paddle wheel has been used several times, including on January 21, 1981, when Ronald Reagan was sworn in minutes before Iran released fifty-two American hostages, ending the Iran hostage crisis. At the time, most newspapers favored the end of the hostage crisis, but the Times placed the inauguration above the crisis. Other occasions in which the  paddle wheel has been used include on July 26, 2000, when the 2000 Camp David Summit ended without an agreement and when Bush announced that Dick Cheney would be his running mate, and on June 24, 2016, when the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum passed, beginning Brexit, and when the Supreme Court deadlocked in United States v. Texas.[276]
The New York Times has run editorials from its editorial board on the front page twice. On June 13, 1920, the Times ran an editorial opposing Warren G. Harding, who was nominated during that year's Republican Party presidential primaries.[277] Amid growing acceptance to run editorials on the front pages[278] from publications such as the Detroit Free Press, The Patriot-News, The Arizona Republic, and The Indianapolis Star, The New York Times ran an editorial on its front page on December 5, 2015, following a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, in which fourteen people were killed.[279] The editorial advocates for the prohibition of ""slightly modified combat rifles"" used in the San Bernardino shooting and ""certain kinds of ammunition"".[277] Conservative figures, including Texas senator Ted Cruz, The Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, Fox & Friends co-anchor Steve Doocy, and then-New Jersey governor Chris Christie criticized the Times. Talk radio host Erick Erickson acquired an issue of The New York Times to fire several rounds into the paper, posting a picture online.[280]
Since 1997,[281] The New York Times's primary distribution center is located in College Point, Queens. The facility is 300,000 sq ft (28,000 m2) and employs 170 people as of 2017. The College Point distribution center prints 300,000 to 800,000 newspapers daily. On most occasions, presses start before 11 p.m. and finish before 3 a.m. A robotic crane grabs a roll of newsprint and several rollers ensure ink can be printed on paper. The final newspapers are wrapped in plastic and shipped out.[282] As of 2018, the College Point facility accounted for 41 percent of production. Other copies are printed at 26 other publications, such as The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Dallas Morning News, The Santa Fe New Mexican, and the Courier Journal. With the decline of newspapers, particularly regional publications, the Times must travel further; for example, newspapers for Hawaii are flown from San Francisco on United Airlines, and Sunday papers are flown from Los Angeles on Hawaiian Airlines. Computer glitches, mechanical issues, and weather phenomena affect circulation but do not stop the paper from reaching customers.[283] The College Point facility prints over two dozen other papers, including The Wall Street Journal and USA Today.[284]
The New York Times has halted its printing process several times to account for major developments. The first printing stoppage occurred on March 31, 1968, when then-president Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he would not seek a second term. Other press stoppages include May 19, 1994, for the death of former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and July 17, 1996, for Trans World Airlines Flight 800. The 2000 presidential election necessitated two press stoppages. Al Gore appeared to concede on November 8, forcing then-executive editor Joseph Lelyveld to stop the Times's presses to print a new headline, ""Bush Appears to Defeat Gore"", with a story that stated George W. Bush was elected president. However, Gore held off his concession speech over doubts over Florida. Lelyveld reran the headline, ""Bush and Gore Vie for an Edge"". Since 2000, three printing stoppages have been issued for the death of William Rehnquist on September 3, 2005, for the killing of Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011, and for the passage of the Marriage Equality Act in the New York State Assembly and subsequent signage by then-governor Andrew Cuomo on June 24, 2011.[285]
The New York Times website is hosted at nytimes.com. It has undergone several major redesigns and infrastructure developments since its debut. In April 2006, The New York Times redesigned its website with an emphasis on multimedia.[286] In preparation for Super Tuesday in February 2008, the Times developed a live election system using the Associated Press's File Transfer Protocol (FTP) service and a Ruby on Rails application; nytimes.com experienced its largest traffic on Super Tuesday and the day after.[287]
The NYTimes application debuted with the introduction of the App Store on July 10, 2008. Engadget's Scott McNulty wrote critically of the app, negatively comparing it to The New York Times's mobile website.[288] An iPad version with select articles was released on April 3, 2010, with the release of the first-generation iPad.[289] In October, The New York Times expanded NYT Editors' Choice to include the paper's full articles. NYT for iPad was free until 2011.[290] The Times applications on iPhone and iPad began offering in-app subscriptions in July 2011.[291] The Times released a web application for iPad—featuring a format summarizing trending headlines on Twitter[292]—and a Windows 8 application in October 2012.[293]
Efforts to ensure profitability through an online magazine and a ""Need to Know"" subscription emerged in Adweek in July 2013.[294] In March 2014, The New York Times announced three applications—NYT Now, an application that offers pertinent news in a blog format, and two unnamed applications, later known as NYT Opinion[295] and NYT Cooking[227]—to diversify its product laterals.[296]
The Daily is the modern front page of The New York Times.
The New York Times manages several podcasts, including multiple podcasts with Serial Productions. The Times's longest-running podcast is The Book Review Podcast,[298] debuting as Inside The New York Times Book Review in April 2006.[299]
The New York Times's defining podcast is The Daily,[297] a daily news podcast hosted by Michael Barbaro which debuted on February 1, 2017.[300] Between March 2022 and March 2025, the approximately 30 minute programme was co-hosted with Sabrina Tavernise.[301] Beginning in April 2025 Barbaro was joined by two new regular co-hosts, Natalie Kitroeff and Rachel Abrams.[302]
The Interview was launched in 2024 and is hosted weekly by David Marchese and Lulu Garcia-Navarro.  Episodes typically last 40 to 50 minutes. Condensed versions of the interviews are published simultaneously in The New York Times Magazine.[303] Guests have included politicians, actors, influential experts, media figures and high-profile writers.
In October 2021, The New York Times began testing ""New York Times Audio"", an application featuring podcasts from the Times, audio versions of articles—including from other publications through Audm, and archives from This American Life.[304] The application debuted in May 2023 exclusively on iOS for Times subscribers. New York Times Audio includes exclusive podcasts such as The Headlines, a daily news recap, and Shorts, short audio stories under ten minutes. In addition, a ""Reporter Reads"" section features Times journalists reading their articles and providing commentary.[305]
The New York Times has used video games as part of its journalistic efforts, among the first publications to do so,[306] contributing to an increase in Internet traffic;[307] the publication has also developed its own video games. In 2014, The New York Times Magazine introduced Spelling Bee, a word game in which players guess words from a set of letters in a honeycomb and are awarded points for the length of the word and receive extra points if the word is a pangram.[308] The game was proposed by Will Shortz, created by Frank Longo, and has been maintained by Sam Ezersky. In May 2018, Spelling Bee was published on nytimes.com, furthering its popularity.[309] In February 2019, the Times introduced Letter Boxed, in which players form words from letters placed on the edges of a square box,[310] followed in June 2019 by Tiles, a matching game in which players form sequences of tile pairings, and Vertex, in which players connect vertices to assemble an image.[311] In July 2023, The New York Times introduced Connections, in which players identify groups of words that are connected by a common property.[312] In April, the Times introduced Digits, a game that required using operations on different values to reach a set number; Digits was shut down in August.[313] In March 2024, The New York Times released Strands, a themed word search.[314]
In January 2022, The New York Times Company acquired Wordle, a word game developed by Josh Wardle in 2021, at a valuation in the ""low-seven figures"".[315] The acquisition was proposed by David Perpich, a member of the Sulzberger family who proposed the purchase to Knight[316] over Slack after reading about the game.[317] The Washington Post purportedly considered acquiring Wordle, according to Vanity Fair.[316] At the 2022 Game Developers Conference, Wardle stated that he was overwhelmed by the volume of Wordle facsimiles and overzealous monetization practices in other games.[318] Concerns over The New York Times monetizing Wordle by implementing a paywall mounted;[319] Wordle is a client-side browser game and can be played offline by downloading its webpage.[320] Wordle moved to the Times's servers and website in February.[321] The game was added to the NYT Games application in August,[322] necessitating it be rewritten in the JavaScript library React.[323] In November, The New York Times announced that Tracy Bennett would be the Wordle's editor.[324]
The New York Times Magazine and The Boston Globe Magazine are the only weekly Sunday magazines following The Washington Post Magazine's cancellation in December 2022.[325]
In February 2016, The New York Times introduced a Spanish website, The New York Times en Español.[326] The website, intended to be read on mobile devices, would contain translated articles from the Times and reporting from journalists based in Mexico City.[327] The Times en Español's style editor is Paulina Chavira, who has advocated for pluralistic Spanish to accommodate the variety of nationalities in the newsroom's journalists and wrote a stylebook for The New York Times en Español.[328]
Articles the Times intends to publish in Spanish are sent to a translation agency and adapted for Spanish writing conventions; the present progressive tense may be used for forthcoming events in English, but other tenses are preferable in Spanish. The Times en Español consults the Real Academia Española and Fundéu and frequently modifies the use of diacritics—such as using an acute accent for the Cártel de Sinaloa but not the Cartel de Medellín—and using the gender-neutral pronoun elle.[329] Headlines in The New York Times en Español are not capitalized. The Times en Español publishes El Times, a newsletter led by Elda Cantú intended for all Spanish speakers.[330] In September 2019, The New York Times ended The New York Times en Español's separate operations.[331] A study published in The Translator in 2023 found that the Times en Español engaged in tabloidization.[332]
In June 2012, The New York Times introduced a Chinese website, 纽约时报中文, in response to Chinese editions created by The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times. Conscious to censorship, the Times established servers outside of China and affirmed that the website would uphold the paper's journalistic standards; the government of China had previously blocked articles from nytimes.com through the Great Firewall,[333] and the website was blocked in China until August 2001 after then-general secretary Jiang Zemin met with journalists from The New York Times.[334] Then-foreign editor Joseph Kahn assisted in the establishment of cn.nytimes.com, an effort that contributed to his appointment as executive editor in April 2022.[335]
In October 2012, 纽约时报中文 published an article detailing the wealth of then-premier Wen Jiabao's family. In response, the government of China blocked access to nytimes.com and cn.nytimes.com and references to the Times and Wen were censored on microblogging service Sina Weibo.[334] In March 2015, a mirror of 纽约时报中文 and the website for GreatFire were the targets for a government-sanctioned distributed denial of service attack on GitHub in March 2015, disabling access to the service for several days.[336] Chinese authorities requested the removal of The New York Times's news applications from the App Store in December 2016.[337]
As of 2023, The New York Times has received 137 Pulitzer Prizes,[338] the most of any publication.[339]
The New York Times is considered a newspaper of record in the United States.[l] The Times is the largest metropolitan newspaper in the United States;[343] as of 2022, The New York Times is the second-largest newspaper by print circulation in the United States behind The Wall Street Journal.[344]
A study published in Science, Technology, & Human Values in 2013 found that The New York Times received more citations in academic journals than the American Sociological Review, Research Policy, or the Harvard Law Review.[345] With sixteen million unique records, the Times is the third-most referenced source in Common Crawl, a collection of online material used in datasets such as GPT-3, behind Wikipedia and a United States patent database.[346]
The New Yorker's Max Norman wrote in March 2023 that the Times has shaped mainstream English usage.[347]  In a January 2018 article for The Washington Post, Margaret Sullivan stated that The New York Times affects the ""whole media and political ecosystem"".[348]
The New York Times's nascent success has led to concerns over media consolidation, particularly amid the decline of newspapers. In 2006, economists Lisa George and Joel Waldfogel examined the consequences of the Times's national distribution strategy and audience with circulation of local newspapers, finding that local circulation decreased among college-educated readers.[349] The effect of The New York Times in this manner was observed in The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead, the newspaper of record for Fargo, North Dakota.[350] Axios founder Jim VandeHei opined that the Times is ""going to basically be a monopoly"" in an opinion piece written by then-media columnist and former BuzzFeed News editor-in-chief Ben Smith; in the article, Smith cites the strength of The New York Times's journalistic workforce, broadening content, and the expropriation of Gawker editor-in-chief Choire Sicha, Recode editor-in-chief Kara Swisher, and Quartz editor-in-chief Kevin Delaney. Smith compared the Times to the New York Yankees during their 1927 season containing Murderers' Row.[351]
Since 2003, studies analyzing coverage of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in the New York Times have demonstrated a bias against Palestinians and in favor of Israel.[m]
The New York Times has received criticism for its coverage of the Gaza war.[357][358] In April 2024, The Intercept reported that a November 2023 internal memorandum by Susan Wessling and Philip Pan instructed journalists to reduce using the terms ""genocide"" and ""ethnic cleansing"" and to avoid using the phrase ""occupied territory"" in the context of Palestinian land, ""Palestine"" except in rare circumstances, and the term ""refugee camps"" to describe areas of Gaza despite recognition from the United Nations.[359] A spokesperson from the Times stated that issuing guidance was standard practice. An analysis by The Intercept noted that The New York Times described Israeli deaths as a massacre nearly sixty times, but had only described Palestinian deaths as a massacre once.[220] Writers and editors have left the newspaper due to its coverage of events in Gaza, including Jazmine Hughes and Jamie Lauren Keiles.[360]
In December 2023, The New York Times published an investigation titled ""'Screams Without Words': How Hamas Weaponized Sexual Violence on Oct. 7"", alleging that Hamas weaponized sexual and gender-based violence during its armed incursion on Israel.[361] The investigation was the subject of an article from The Intercept questioning the journalistic acumen of Anat Schwartz, a filmmaker involved in the inquiry who had no prior reporting experience and agreed with a post stating Israel should ""violate any norm, on the way to victory"", doubting the veracity of the opening claim that Gal Abdush was raped in a timespan disputed by her family, and alleging that the Times was pressured by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America.[362] The New York Times initiated an inquiry into the leaking of confidential information about the report to other outlets, which received criticism from NewsGuild of New York president Susan DeCarava for purported racial targeting;[363] the Times's investigation was inconclusive, but found gaps in the way proprietary journalistic material is handled.[364]
The New York Times Building has been a site of protest action during the Gaza war and genocide, including a November 2023 sit-in demanding that The Times’ editorial board publicly call for a ceasefire and accusing the media company of ""complicity in laundering genocide,""[365] a  February 29, 2024 protest and press conference following the release of The Intercept's critical investigation into the NYT ""Screams Without Words"" exposé,[366] and an action on July 30, 2025 in which protesters spray-painted ""NYT Lies, Gaza dies"" on the building's glass facade.[367] In addition, protesters blocked The New York Times' distribution center March 14, 2024[368] and executive editor Joseph Kahn's residence was splattered with red paint on August 25, 2025.[369][370] The collective Writers Against the War on Gaza, which publishes the mock publication The New York War Crimes, has been associated with protests against The New York Times.[371] On October 27, 2025, 300 writers—including scholars, journalists, and public intellectuals—pledged[372] to boycott The New York Times and withhold contributions to the paper in protest of what they describe as its complicity in the Gaza genocide, demanding 1) a review of anti-Palestinian bias in the newsroom, 2) a retraction of ""Screams Without Words"", and 3) a call from the Editorial Board for a US arms embargo on Israel.[373][374][375][376] Among the initial signatories, about 150 had previously contributed to the Times.[373][374]
The New York Times has received criticism regarding its coverage of transgender people. When it published an opinion piece by Weill Cornell Medicine professor Richard A. Friedman called ""How Changeable Is Gender?"" in August 2015,[377] Vox's German Lopez criticized Friedman as suggesting that parents and doctors might be right in letting children suffer from severe dysphoria in case something changes down the line, and as implying that conversion therapy may work for transgender children.[378] In February 2023, nearly one thousand[379] current and former Times writers and contributors wrote an open letter addressed to standards editor Philip B. Corbett, criticizing the paper's coverage of transgender, non⁠-⁠binary, and gender-nonconforming people; some of the Times' articles have been cited in state legislatures attempting to justify criminalizing gender-affirming care.[380] Contributors wrote in the open letter that ""the Times has in recent years treated gender diversity with an eerily familiar mix of pseudoscience and euphemistic, charged language, while publishing reporting on trans children that omits relevant information about its sources.""[n]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disraeli_(TV_serial),Disraeli (TV serial),"
Disraeli, also called Disraeli: Portrait of a Romantic, is a 1978 four-part British serial about the great statesman and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Benjamin Disraeli. It was produced by Associated Television and aired on ITV.
With a screenplay by David Butler, it stars Ian McShane and was directed by Claude Whatham. Spanning five decades of Disraeli's life, the serial focuses as much on Disraeli's personal life as it does on his political persona.
Filmed on site in England, the miniseries received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Limited Series after being broadcast in the US in 1980 as part of Masterpiece Theatre under the title Disraeli: Portrait of a Romantic.[1]
As the series starts, Disraeli is a Byronic world traveler who has published two novels but is struggling with debt. He tries making connections in high society, and eventually runs for office several times, albeit unsuccessfully.
Much of his personal life is covered, and his more successful involvement with politics starts in the second episode, which ends with his being sworn in as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The rest of the series chronicles his rise to power, the death of his wife, his two terms as Prime Minister, and his rivalry with Gladstone.
The miniseries was widely praised.[2] The American television magazine Panorama wrote that ""McShane captures the inner contradictions of the man"" and ""It says a lot for Ian McShane's performance in this television series that he brings out both the likeable and the questionable qualities in Disraeli's character.""[2]
The miniseries was broadcast in the U.S. on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre in 1980[3] and was subsequently nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series.[1]
In 1980 screenwriter David Butler also published a book based on the series, titled Disraeli: Portrait of a Romantic, via Warner Books.[4]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallows_and_Amazons_(1974_film),Swallows and Amazons (1974 film),"
Swallows and Amazons is a 1974 British film adaption of the 1930 novel of the same name by Arthur Ransome. The film, which was directed by Claude Whatham and produced by Richard Pilbrow, starred Virginia McKenna and Ronald Fraser, with Zanna Hamilton. Its budget was provided by Nat Cohen of EMI Films who had funded the successful 1970 film The Railway Children.[1][2]
During the school holidays, the Walker children (John, Susan, Titty and Roger; the Swallows) are staying at a farm near a lake in the Lake District. They sail a borrowed dinghy named Swallow, and camp on an island in the lake that they call Wild Cat Island.
They meet two local girls, Nancy and Peggy Blackett, who sail a dinghy named Amazon and live in Beckfoot a house up the nearby Amazon River. The Amazons (the Blackett girls; they call themselves ""Amazon Pirates"" and fly the ""Jolly Roger"" on their yacht) have been coming to the island for years, and claim it as their territory. So the scene is set for serious rivalry.
Eventually they make friends and agree to join forces against a common enemy – the Blacketts' Uncle Jim (Jim Turner) whom they call ""Captain Flint"" (after the character in Treasure Island). Uncle Jim, normally an ally of his nieces, has withdrawn from their company to write his memoirs and has become decidedly unfriendly.
To determine who should be the overall leader in their campaign against Captain Flint, the Blacketts and the Walkers have a contest to see which can capture the others' boat. As part of their strategy the Walkers make a dangerous crossing of the lake by night, and John is later cautioned by his mother for this reckless act. The Walkers nevertheless win the contest – thanks to Titty who seizes the Amazon when the Blacketts come to Wild Cat Island. Eventually there is a mock battle between ""Captain Flint"" and the children, after which Uncle Jim is tried for his crimes and forced to walk the plank on his own houseboat. They agree at the post-battle feast to be friends forever.
[3]
The film was shot on location in the Lake District National Park in Cumbria during the summer of 1973. Actual locations were used to recreate the fictional lake in Arthur Ransome's novel. In April 2010, the dinghy named Swallow in the film was bought by a group of enthusiasts who restored her to sailing condition.[4]
EMI distributed the film in the UK in 1974.
The film has been made available on video, both in VHS and DVD, in the UK, but is not readily available in the USA and elsewhere.

Welcome to the portal for VisualEditor, an editing tool developed by the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF). It allows users to contribute to Wikipedia without the prerequisite need to learn or understand the underlying language and formatting. Before the release of this tool, the only way for users to make contributions to Wikipedia was by using the 'Source editor', which requires users to understand wiki markup (also known as wikitext) in order for their intended edits to be formatted and displayed how they were intended; however, VisualEditor provides a new way for people to edit most elements of articles and pages without the need to understand any code or markup. The WMF staff hopes that this tool will encourage more readers to become editors.
Experienced editors may still prefer editing with the wikitext source editor because they find it faster, more precise, more full-featured, and less buggy. It will also be needed for editing all discussion pages. Editors who enable VisualEditor will always have the Source editor option available on every page.
VisualEditor still has many bugs and missing features. If you encounter an issue using the VisualEditor on Wikipedia.org or another Wikimedia project (i.e., not on a third-party wiki), you can report it on the MediaWiki Feedback page. WMF staff prefer that you report bugs via the Phabricator bug tracking website.
VisualEditor is a ""visual"" way of editing Wikipedia that allows people to contribute without having to learn wiki markup. This rich-text editor was made available as an opt-in release on the English-language Wikipedia in December 2012, in 14 other languages in April 2013, and in most other languages at the beginning of June 2013. As of April 2015, it was available by default to users of about 76% of the language editions of Wikipedias and as an opt-in beta feature to the rest, along with most non-Wikipedia projects except Wiktionary and Wikisource. On English Wikipedia, it is enabled by default for new editors.[1]
As of 2021, VisualEditor was used about half as often as the 2010 wikitext editor, and about as often as the mobile web editor. It is used about twice as often as Twinkle.
To learn more about using VisualEditor, please read the guide to VisualEditor and the list of common keyboard shortcuts. Your help with the many tasks that need to be done is appreciated. You can also receive regular status updates on your talk page by signing up for the VisualEditor newsletter.
Current known limitations include: 
You can click ""Review your changes"" to review the wikitext changes before saving a page. Please report any problems you see, after first searching open VE tickets to make sure it hasn't been reported already..
Help is needed to make VisualEditor as good as it can be: You can find and report bugs and ideas for improvements or lend a hand in many other tasks, such as:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Recent_changes_patrol,Wikipedia:Recent changes patrol,"
Recent changes patrol, or RC patrol, is a volunteer-led patrol whereby individual users check the recent changes of various articles for inappropriate edits.
The patrol is entirely voluntary and carries no obligation. At its heart, it is really just a way to try to ensure that every edited article gets checked in a timely manner and is given a boost on its way to becoming a ""featured article"", while simultaneously ensuring that Wikipedia is not harmed by unconstructive edits.
Regular RC patrollers may wish to put the RC patrol userbox on their user page by adding {{User wikipedia/RC Patrol}} to their user pages.
Regular RC patrollers may wish to put the RC patrol topicon on their user page by adding {{RC patroller topicon}} to their user pages.
RC patrolling primarily consists of a four-step process:
Throughout the entire process of RC patrol, it is important to remember not to bite the newcomers.  A 2006 essay indicated that newcomers, far from being a monolithic horde of vandals, trolls and spammers, wrote most of Wikipedia's content.[1]
If you see a new user or IP address contributing, welcome them if you're so inclined, and include a pointer or two of feedback about how they can make their contributions even better. Most will welcome the support.
It is also important to assume good faith as much as possible, or minimally to assume incompetence or lack of experience instead of malice.  For example, remember everyone may not be computer-literate; some people will accidentally blank or damage pages when attempting to cut and paste material from Wikipedia.  Others may not understand that their edits actually cause an impact on their respective article.
One thing to keep in mind is to not only focus on patrolling articles in the main namespace but also to check other pages — such as, for example, image pages, which are frequently victims of nonsensical edits and vandalism. Such unchecked edits may be particularly harmful because the result might be removal of copyright tags.
Look for newcomer tests (odd edits which are not vandalism), but do not bite the newcomers. Revert their experiments and leave one of the following messages on their user talk page. Be sure to sign and timestamp (~~~~) the warning. You can use tools such as Twinkle or RedWarn to revert the page and issue the warning faster.
Addition of unsourced material without proper citations

Further non-constructive edits sometimes can be viewed as vandalism, and dealt with as below.
Look out for vandalism, and revert it. It is often worthwhile to check the page history after reverting to make sure you have removed all the vandalism. Also, check the user contributions of the vandal - you will often find more malicious edits.
Additionally, leave warning messages on the vandal's talk pages using the following system. Be sure to check discussion pages for possible explanations of edits.
Note that these templates do not need to be used sequentially. If the edit is clearly vandalism, use the template {{uw-vandalism1}} instead. For continuing severe vandalism, {{uw-vandalism2}} may be skipped and {{uw-vandalism3}} given straight after the first warning. If, however, you are not sure that the edit is vandalism, always start with {{uw-test1}}. If a user made such an edit and reverted it themselves, use a {{Uw-selfrevert}}. For extreme or extensive cases of vandalism committed by users who have received no prior warnings, {{uw-vandalism4im}} may be used. The ~~~~ in the templates below cause the time and your signature to be added to the warning.

Alternatively, you can use:

to explicitly state which articles were vandalized. Where appropriate, replace the ""#"" with the warning level number (1 to 4). Insert the title of the article being referenced. For example:
The ""subst"" causes the template text to be pasted into the talk page as if you had typed it out, instead of leaving {{subst:uw-test1}} visible when editing the page. This makes the messages more personal to the user, and thus, more friendly. Also, if someone vandalizes the template, then the vandalism will not affect every page that uses the text from the template.

If the vandal will not stop, list them at Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism.  Ensure that the user has been warned thoroughly before posting a notice on Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism and has had time (three or four minutes) to read the warnings and still ignore them. If a user has not been sufficiently warned, or has only vandalized a couple of times an administrator may simply remove the notice without action.
The blocking administrator will usually leave this or one of the other Block Templates on the vandal's talk page:
Remember to sign and timestamp your warnings by leaving four tildes (like this: ~~~~).
Also, consider tracing the IP address. Find owners by using:
If an address is not in one, it will probably be in another. Then add {{Shared IP}} to the talk pages of users who vandalise – for persons editing from an organization the realisation that they can be traced is often sufficient to make them stop. (See the template page for variations as to schools, libraries, government institutions, etc.)
The following is a list of tools and resources available for those who want to clean up with a more systematic approach.
The old school way is to load recent changes and check the (diff) links. It can be filtered according to featured articles, good articles, living people, new accounts' contribs, IPs' contribs, mobile contribs (as these are more prone to vandalism, see Help:Recent changes), and even by likelihood of being damaging or bad-faith. Searching for pages by their namespace and specific tags (e.g. VisualEditor, possible BLP issue or vandalism, etc.) can also be done. If they contain harmful edits, you revert to the previous version. However, the high volume of edits that occur each second makes this difficult to accomplish most of the time, and several tools have been created to simplify the process:
These tools extend the rollback feature by allowing you to specify a summary when using rollback. They may also offer additional features:
These tools can be used to achieve the same effect as rollback if you do not have it.

Note that these are not operated by or affiliated with Wikipedia.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Shakespeare_Theatre,Royal Shakespeare Theatre,"
The Royal Shakespeare Theatre (RST) (originally called the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre) is a Grade II* listed 1,040+ seat thrust stage theatre owned by the Royal Shakespeare Company dedicated to the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It is located beside the River Avon in the town of Stratford-upon-Avon – Shakespeare's birthplace – in the English Midlands. The building incorporates the smaller Swan Theatre. The Royal Shakespeare and Swan Theatres re-opened in November 2010 after undergoing a major renovation known as the Transformation Project.[1]
The tricentenary of Shakespeare's birth in 1864 gave impetus for a permanent memorial to him in his hometown. The original Shakespeare Memorial Theatre came about through the campaigning efforts and donations of Edward Fordham Flower and his son Charles Edward Flower, owners of a local brewery business in Stratford, and important figures in local political affairs, due to their efforts, the first theatre was opened on the banks of the Avon on 19 April 1879.[2][3] It was a Victorian Gothic structure, designed by William Unsworth and Edward Dodgshun.[4]
The original theatre was gutted by fire on 6 March 1926.[5] The new Shakespeare Memorial Theatre opened in 1932 on a site adjacent to the original.[6] The architect was Elisabeth Scott, so the theatre became the first important building erected in Britain from the designs of a woman architect.[7] It was renamed  the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1961, following the establishment of the Royal Shakespeare Company the previous year.[4]
In the building designed by Scott, the theatre had a proscenium-arch stage, and a seating capacity of about 1,400 people, on three tiers (stalls, circle and balcony). Two tiers of seating were later added to the side walls of the theatre and the stage extended beyond the proscenium, by means of an 'apron'. Balcony seats could only be accessed by means of a staircase to the side of the building, separate from the main foyer and bar. The theatre has several notable Art Deco features, including the staircase and corridors at either side of the auditorium. It is a Grade II* listed building.[3]
The current theatre complex includes the remains of the original 1879 theatre, which was rebuilt and incorporated into Scott's building to serve as a conference centre and rehearsal room. Since 1986 it has been used by the Swan Theatre.[5]
The Royal Shakespeare and Swan Theatres are on the western bank of the River Avon, with the adjacent Bancroft Gardens providing a scenic riverside setting. The Rooftop Restaurant and Bar overlooks both the river and the Bancroft Gardens.
The Royal Shakespeare Company had renovated the Royal Shakespeare Theatre as part of a £112.8m Transformation project which included the creation of a new 1040+ seat, thrust stage auditorium which brought actors and audiences closer together, with the distance of the furthest seat from the stage being reduced from 27 metres (89 ft) to 15 metres (49 ft). The Transformation project also included improvements to the Swan Theatre, the creation of an array of new public spaces, including a new Riverside Cafe and Rooftop Restaurant, a 36-metre (118 ft) observation tower, and improved backstage conditions for the actors and crew.[1] The new theatre is also more accessible to people with disabilities and offers a more comfortable theatre experience.
The theatre is a ""one-room"" theatre, which allows the actors and the audience to share the same space, as they did when Shakespeare's plays were first produced. The stage reaches out into the audience, who are seated on three sides of it. This one-room theatre creates a more traditional Shakespearean performance area, allowing the audience to draw closer to the actors and creating a more personal theatre experience.
The funding for the project came from many different sources including; private pledges, Arts Council England, and the regional development agency Advantage West Midlands, as well as a successful public fundraising campaign. The Transformation project also incorporated the creation of the temporary Courtyard Theatre to house performances in Stratford-upon-Avon during the time the Royal Shakespeare and Swan Theatres were closed, new offices at Chapel Lane, a nursery and refurbished rehearsal rooms at Arden Street. The project reached over a total of £100 million in cost and also drew in financial support from RSC America and its own board members.[8]
Plans to redevelop the theatre were finalised and work commenced in 2007, with a scheduled completion date of 2010. The RSC had its own project team, led by Project Director, Peter Wilson OBE. Other members of the project team included: Bennetts Associates (architects),[9] Buro Happold (engineers and transport consultants), Charcoalblue (theatre consultants), Mace (construction managers), Acoustic Dimensions (acoustic consultants), Drivers Jonas Deloitte (project management and strategic planning advisors) and Gardiner and Theobald (quantity surveyors and planning supervisors).
An urn containing the ashes of Actor Ian Richardson who had died on 9 February 2007 was placed into the foundations of the auditorium of the building during its renovation in 2008 by his widow Maroussia Frank and his son Miles Richardson.[10]
Meanwhile, performances were transferred to the temporary Courtyard Theatre, which was a full-sized working prototype for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, built on the site of the RSC's studio theatre, The Other Place.
The new theatre opened in November 2010, with preview events and activities, in advance of the first full Shakespeare performances from the RSC's existing repertoire from February 2011. The first new productions designed specifically for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre's stage began from April 2011, with Michael Boyd's Macbeth, part of the RSC's 50th Birthday Season celebrations, which ran from April to December 2011.
Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip officially opened the Royal Shakespeare Theatre on 4 March 2011. Ceremonies included a performance of the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet.[11][12]
The theatre has a new Rooftop Restaurant and Bar with views over the River Avon, a Riverside Cafe and Terrace, a Colonnade linking the Royal Shakespeare and Swan Theatres together for the first time, the PACCAR Room exhibition space, and a 36-metre-high (118 ft) tower which provides circulation and views across Stratford-upon-Avon and the surrounding area from its 32-metre-high (105 ft) viewing platform. There is also a riverside walk which stretches from the Bancroft Gardens, past the theatre, towards Holy Trinity Church.
The whole building is now accessible for the first time for visitors, performers and staff with disabilities. The renovations tripled the number of dedicated wheelchair spaces in the new auditorium from those in the previous auditorium, added lifts (there were no public lifts in the previous building), accessible toilets on all levels and removed steps on the riverside walk, which previously had many stepped levels.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great!_Movies,Great! Movies,"
Great! Movies (stylised as GREAT! MOVIES)[1][2] is a British FAST television channel (and previously a free-to-air linear channel) owned by Narrative Entertainment UK Limited that broadcasts across the UK and Ireland showing films and related content. The channel was transmitted on most of the major broadcast platforms in the UK - terrestrial, satellite and cable. It was broadcast in standard-definition on satellite, cable, and terrestrial, was also broadcast in high-definition on Sky Glass and eventually commenced broadcasting on Samsung TV Plus and Rakuten TV in November 2022.
The Sony Movie Channel brand was made available outside the US for the first time when a British version of the station launched on the Sky platform in the UK and Ireland on 3 May 2012 (2012-05-03).[3][4] To release Sky guide slots for the launch of SMC and its +1 timeshift, Movies4Men 2 and its +1 service were closed (and thus lost by Freesat viewers).
At launch and until 2018, SMC was broadcast on a free-to-view basis, meaning that access to channel was only available to those with a Sky viewing card, and although no subscription payment was required to view the channel, it was unavailable to Freesat devices.
On 10 January 2017, Sony Movie Channel was added to Freeview and Virgin Media, replacing Movie Mix, which already broadcast some of the same content.[5] In preparation for the switch, Movie Mix and SMC had been broadcasting an identical schedule in the final days prior to the transition.
Sony Movie Channel became fully free to air on satellite on 13 August 2018, in preparation for its full launch on the Freesat programme guide on 9 October 2018.[6] To permit SMC's launch on Freesat, Sony reorganised their other movie channels on the guide: Movies4Men +1 was no longer listed on the Freesat guide as a result of the addition of SMC, though remains freely available for manual tune-in. Encryption was also removed from Sony Movie Channel +1 at the same time, though this was not added to the Freesat full guide.
On 24 July 2019, it was announced that the channel will be renamed as Sony Movies from 10 September 2019.[7]
On 25 May 2021, the channel rebranded as Great! Movies as the channel was acquired by Narrative Capital/Narrative Entertainment.[8]
On 9 November 2022, Narrative Entertainment UK Limited announced the launch of a FAST version of Great! Movies, to stream on Samsung TV Plus, the new FAST network has the same branding as the linear channel, but a different schedule. A FAST version of Great! Movies Christmas was also launched.[9]
In June 2023, the channel launched an on demand service known as Great! Player, available
via the red button on Great! Movies on Freeview.[10]
On 18 October 2023, Great! Movies +1 was replaced by Great! Movies Extra on Freeview channel 61. On 20 March 2024, Great! Movies Extra was replaced by Great! Real on Freeview channel 61.
On 4 September 2025, the channel was replaced by Great! Mystery on Freeview, Sky & Virgin.[11]The Great! Mystery FAST variant was replaced by a FAST version of Great! Christmas on Samsung, Rakuten and Netgem TV, but on Freeview it was replaced by the FAST version of Great! Movies.[12]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STV_(TV_channel),STV (TV channel),"
STV is a free-to-air public broadcast television channel owned and operated by the STV Group. It is made up of the Central Scotland and Northern Scotland ITV public broadcaster licences, formerly known as Scottish Television (now legally STV Central Ltd) and Grampian Television (now legally STV North Ltd) respectively.
The STV brand refers to the on-air name used by Scottish Television for much of its history - notably in the 1970s and early 1980s. This brand remained in conversational use amongst the local public afterwards.
The modern STV brand was adopted on Tuesday 30 May 2006 replacing both franchises' previous identities. The sense of continuity in the name was demonstrated when STV celebrated its 60th birthday in 2017, with special programmes broadcast on STV itself and STV2.
STV is now the only part of the Channel 3 network that is not owned by ITV plc. The station does not carry ITV1 branding or show ITV1's network presentation except during news broadcasts, and between 6am and 9.25am, when it is replaced by the ITV-owned-and-branded national franchise ITV Breakfast.
On 2 March 2006, it was announced by SMG plc (now 'STV Group plc') that Scottish Television would revert to the brand name of 'STV', used from the start of colour broadcasting in 1969 until 30 August 1985, and which the station was still informally known as. At the same time, Grampian Television would also become known as STV North. The new-look branding was launched on 30 May 2006.[1]
In January 2007, the station launched separate news services for the East and West of the STV Central region, initially as a five-minute opt out within the 6:00pm edition of Scotland Today on weeknights.
Regional news coverage was expanded again in May 2011 with the launch of separate half-hour editions of STV News at Six for the East and West, and localised late night news bulletins each weeknight.
STV were awarded local TV licences in January 2013 to operate two digital television channels in Glasgow and Edinburgh respectively, for up to 12 years.[2] STV Glasgow launched on Monday, 2 June 2014 with an expanded schedule of local news, features and entertainment programming. STV Edinburgh launched on 12 January 2015. The two channels were later closed and merged with three other local TV licences to form a new national network, STV2, in April 2017. Existing regional news bulletins continued to air on the main STV Central service.
In June 2018, the Edinburgh-based bulletins were axed and replaced with shorter opt-outs within a Central Scotland edition of STV News at Six, co-anchored from the Glasgow and Edinburgh studios.[3]
In July 2009, STV announced that it was withdrawing some networked programmes such as The Bill, Doc Martin, Midsomer Murders, Poirot, Lewis and a number of other high-profile ITV network dramas from its schedules, instead preferring to concentrate on programming made within Scotland.[4] The practice of dropping networked shows had been in operation for other programmes since November 2008 when STV announced it would opt out of programmes they claimed were not performing well in their broadcast region, including Sharpe's Peril, Al Murray's Happy Hour, Moving Wallpaper, Benidorm and The Alan Titchmarsh Show.
ITV's coverage of the FA Cup was also dropped, with England matches and highlights programmes also withdrawn. The vacated football slots would be filled by the regular programme line-up, as well as films or special events, with one such example being the first debate in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election airing against a friendly between England and Ghana at Wembley on March 29 2011. If an FA Cup game went to extra time or penalties, STV would add additional filler programming until it was time to re-join the ITV network.
ITV plc claimed that STV were in breach of their network agreements by making this decision and sued STV for £38 million.[5][6] STV launched its own legal action against ITV plc,[7] claiming the company was owed money and unhappy about promotional advertising of their services. The then executive chairman of ITV plc, Michael Grade claimed his company was the ""victim"" in the ongoing dispute.[8]
Amid many protests, the company's chief executive Rob Woodward admitted in December 2009 that STV had made a 'major mistake' by dropping some of the networked dramas and replacing them in some cases with imported output, repeats and films. The company pledged to continue with its plan to produce more regional programming and opt out of networked output with further plans announced in August 2010.[9]
On 27 April 2011, ITV plc and STV Group plc settled their legal dispute, with the former receiving £18 million from STV.[10][11]
The £18 million consists of a £7.2 million cash payment payable in 2011 and £10.8 million either in programme rights at the end of the year or cash, as adjusted, depending on further discussions with ITV plc. The programming rights payment is capped at a maximum of £15 million. In addition, STV will receive £2.4 million of credit for programme opt outs in 2011.[12] STV said it believed it was in the best interests of shareholders to end the long period of uncertainty. The parties have agreed the basis of a more collaborative relationship for the future.
In March 2012, a deal was announced between ITV and the other Channel 3 licence holders which would transform its commercial relationship with them after the broadcasters negotiated new Channel 3 networking arrangements. The deal would see STV and UTV become ""affiliates"" of the network, meaning they would pay an up-front fee for the rights to broadcast ITV content. At the time, the licence holders paid a percentage of the Channel 3 network costs based on their share of qualifying revenue.[13][14] On 23 August 2012 STV confirmed the new network agreement with ITV was in operation.[15]
In March 2010, The Daily Telegraph reported that Ofcom would launch an investigation over claims that STV allowed the Scottish Government to influence its schedules and replace networked series with Scottish-based programmes.[16] An Ofcom report released four months later cleared STV of allowing political interference within feature series, but 18 short social action programmes were found to have been influenced too closely by sponsorship from Government agencies and initiatives.[17]
The two licences still produce regional programmes, although the only difference between them is the respective news programmes: STV News broadcasts separate bulletins to Northern Scotland (including an opt-out for the Tayside area) and Central Scotland (incluidng an opt-out for the East of the region). There is no ""STV South"" as Southern Scotland is part of the ITV Border region owned by ITV plc.
Emphasising the fact that STV is essentially one channel across the two regions, there is a single director of channels (Bobby Hain – former managing director of Scottish Television), and a single head of news (Linda Grimes Douglas).[18] Terms in the renewed licences for both STV Central and STV North also mean that regional non-news programmes are shared (and identically scheduled) across both licences.
Today, news and current affairs forms the bulk of STV's regular programming on Channel 3, which includes the topical analysis programme Scotland Tonight. The company formerly produced many Gaelic programmes, some of which are now shown on the Gaelic-language channel, BBC Alba, including Speaking our Language and Machair. On a network scale, one of STV's most famous exports is the long-running crime drama Taggart, set in Glasgow.
The STV studios in Glasgow were originally located in the former Theatre Royal in the Cowcaddens area of the city. The first programme broadcast by STV from the Theatre Royal studios was This is Scotland on 31 August 1957. In 1974, the company sold the Theatre Royal to Scottish Opera for conversion back to a full theatre and national opera house[20] and moved into custom-built studios next door. The association with Cowcaddens ended in July 2006 when the station moved to new, smaller studios in Pacific Quay, alongside the Glasgow Science Centre.
In Edinburgh, STV converted the Gateway Theatre in Leith Walk into colour studios during the mid-late 1960s – a facility which proved especially useful in 1969 when a fire gutted studio A at the Theatre Royal, killing a fireman. 
The Edinburgh studios later became a permanent production centre for Take the High Road before being closed in the early 1990s to save costs. A smaller news and advertising operation was established at George Street in the city centre, before moving to premises at Fountainbridge in 2012, from where regional news bulletins and the short-lived STV Edinburgh channel originated. In 2024, the Edinburgh studio was closed[21] before moving again to Queensferry Road the following year.
STV North's Aberdeen headquarters moved to new smaller studios in the city's Tullos area in June 2003, vacating a converted tram depot that had been used since Grampian Television's launch in September 1961. Expansions to the Queen's Cross complex were made in 1983 and 1987 – the former as part of a £5 million investment into the company's technical facilities.
Around the time of the station's launch, Grampian also established premises in Dundee, later moving to Albany House in 1980 and Harbour Chambers in 1998. In April 2008, a new Dundee studio for local news and advertising operations was opened in the Seabraes area of the city, before moving again to offices at the Dundee Technology Park in 2025.
Grampian opened a base for local Highlands & Islands newsgathering in Inverness in 1983, situated in Huntly Street, which has since re-located to Stoneyfield Business Park. A studio complex in Stornoway was opened in 1993 to accommodate the expansion of the station's Scots Gaelic programming production. The studios closed in 2000 following the axing of the Gaelic news service, Telefios, but are now part of MG Alba which took over the site as its headquarters.
Grampian also established secondary studios in Edinburgh during the late 1960s from where some of the station's light entertainment programming was produced. The studios were closed in 1969.
On 21 April 2010, STV Group plc. announced their intention to launch an HD channel on digital TV, before the 2010 World Cup.[22] The station launched on 6 June 2010, initially broadcasting on Freeview channel 51, from the Black Hill, Keelylang Hill and Bressay transmitters, and now broadcasts from all post-digital switchover transmitters in its coverage area. STV HD was also made available on Virgin Media channel 113 in STV's transmission area soon after the launch of Freeview.[23] The channel follows the launch of ITV1 HD, which became available on 2 April 2010 to viewers in the Scottish borders (who are served by ITV Border), England and Wales. STV Group plc. had been in talks with BSkyB, Freesat and the ITV Network with a view to making STV HD available via Sky and Freesat soon after the channels' initial launch.[24] A test version of the channel was available free-to-air via satellite, but had to be manually tuned as it was not included on either the Sky or Freesat EPGs.
In September 2013, STV announced via Twitter that STV HD will be available for the first time on the Sky and Freesat from April 2014, nearly four years after first launching the channel on Freeview and Virgin Media.[citation needed] STV HD was added to Freesat and Sky on 28 April 2014.[25]
Currently, STV HD is delivered across four transmission areas: North, West, East and Tayside. Only the North[26] and West regions are broadcast Free-to-Air,[27] the other two are Free-to-View and encrypted, and require a Viewing Card to watch them.[28] The reason has to do with how those other two regions are broadcast on a pan-European satellite beam, which if broadcast unencrypted would potentially lead to licensing issues.[29]
On 4 January 2011, Freeview announced details for the launch of ITV1 +1, together with the possibility that both STV and UTV would launch their own timeshift services, STV +1 and UTV +1 in Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively.[30] STV later confirmed that it would launch STV +1 at 8 pm on 11 January 2011. The channel is available to Freeview viewers on channel 35 and Virgin Media cable customers on channel 114.
The timeshift channel STV +1 has been replaced with the micro Channel 3 region serving the Dundee area on satellite. STV +1 had been available on satellite till then, but not carried on either Sky EPG or Freesat channel guides.
There are two regional variations of STV +1 on Freeview and Virgin.  One for North and one for Central Scotland. The North service shows Aberdeen-based news and commercials and the Central service carries the West region news bulletins and commercials. 
STV +1 is available to stream on STV Player on various platforms.
STV serves central and northern Scotland. Within STV, Scotland is split into two regions and four sub-regions. Networked and regional programming is the same in both regions, apart from regional news and advertising. Within both regions, there are further opt-outs providing sub-regional news and commercials.
STV North (formerly Grampian Television) is based in Aberdeen and serves Northern Scotland. The main news programme serving the area is the North edition of STV News at Six, alongside short regional bulletins (STV News/Good Morning Scotland) on weekdays. The main 6 pm programme on weeknights includes local opt-outs for the North East and Highlands & Islands and Tayside and North East Fife). The two sub-regions also receive separate commercials.
STV Central (formerly Scottish Television) is based at the STV Group headquarters in Glasgow and serves Central Scotland. The main news programme serving the area is the Central edition of STV News at Six, alongside short regional bulletins (STV News/Good Morning Scotland) on weekdays. The main 6pm programme on weeknights includes local opt-outs for the West and East of the region. The Glasgow newsroom also produces pan-regional bulletins for the North and Central regions at weekends.
Altogether, the regions and sub-regions serve a population of 4,993,590.
On 25 September 2025, STV announced it would seek permission from OFCOM to replace its two regional news services. Subject to regulatory approval, separate news programmes for the North would be replaced with a pan-regional programme covering both STV licence areas from Glasgow, with the Aberdeen studios closing.[31] According to chief executive Rufus Radcliffe, the company is also seeking to end its sub-regional opt out bulletins for Tayside and Edinburgh.[32].
The celebrity look remained until 2006, when the Scottish and Grampian names were traded in for one unified look: STV. The first ident package featured an elongated blue 'S', with scenes of Scottish people in various locations passing around the 'S' from person to person in differing scenes, until one person places the S in the centre of the screen.
An updated look was introduced on 23 March 2009, consisting of a picture postcard scene which would flip over to the right to reveal another theme. This flipping increases in pace and as the camera pulls back before the STV logo forms against a gradient blue background.
On 2 June 2014, STV's logo was given a slight update. The logo is now 3D, and the white ""tv"" is now situated on a gradient blue triangle while light blue curves appear on the 3 sides. The ""S"" colour was changed to gradient light blue.
stv.tv was first launched in May 2006, with the merger of Scottish TV and Grampian TV, both becoming ""STV"". The first incarnation of the website was simply the old Scottish TV website with the new STV logo and some new colours, whilst work was ongoing behind the scenes to launch a brand-new site, with new features.
Website builder, Dog Digital helped launch the new-look site in July 2006, with the aim of being Scotland’s main source of online information and entertainment, targeting a wide Scottish audience, with a younger market bias. Dog's remit had been to devise, deliver and develop a strategic digital marketing plan for the new online channel, including the design and integration of the new brand, navigation, and digital marketing in the form of a sizeable online campaign which would be activated to raise awareness of the new online channel. Along with the expected News, Sport, Weather and Programme pages, the site also had other stand-alone sections: stvbingo.tv,[33] stvdate.tv[34] and stvout.tv.[35] STV later took interest in other classified sites, including money-saving and consumer website, PeoplesChampion.com[36] and SmartyCars.com,[37] a car-selling and motoring site. All of these stand-alone sites would later close, one by one.
STV began overhauling the website in August 2008, with the launch of their online catch-up service, stv.tv/video, developed by online video specialists, Brightcove. Over the coming months, the various sections of the site were updated with the new layout, and more programme pages were created, including for shows from the ITV Network.
In early 2009. STV launched its new online classified recruitment service, stvjobs.com.[38] The site was supported by a multi-million pound media campaign including TV, Radio, Cinema, Online, Direct and Outdoor Advertising. The website closed in 2013.
In July 2009, the Video section of the site was relaunched as ""STV Player"", with added functionality, including parental controls and TV schedules.[39]
STV Casino,[40] in partnership with NetPlay TV, was launched on air and online in September 2009, and closed February 2010. The following year, STV launched another casino website, STV Live Casino[41] in July 2011. This site was also closed down.
STV Holidays[42] was launched in 2011, in partnership with Barrhead Travel. The website would later be rebranded as ""ScottishPassport.com"", to accompany the STV series, before closing down altogether.
STV Local,[43] an initiative which aimed to create a network of hyper-local websites across Scotland, was launched in June 2011. The first areas to launch were Airdrie, Bellshill, Coatbridge, Cumbernauld, Motherwell and Wishaw. The service was rolled out across the whole of Scotland over the following two years. The local services were closed in July 2013, before the launch of dedicated websites for the cities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow later that year. The initiative was then quietly dropped, with the City websites redirecting to their relevant sections of the STV News website.
In October 2016, after the success of the STV Children's Appeal, the company launched The Scottish Children’s Lottery.[44] The Scottish Children’s Lottery operated independently of STV in accordance with the requirements of the licences from the UK Gambling Commission. The lottery was sold to MBC ELM Limited in 2021.[45]
In mid-2017, STV Player was made the homepage of stv.tv, with the small News and Competitions sections on the homepage removed, with just a link to those pages at the header and footer of the page.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One_HD,BBC One,"
BBC One is a British free-to-air public broadcast television channel owned and operated by the BBC. It is the corporation's oldest and flagship channel, and is known for broadcasting mainstream programming, which includes BBC News television bulletins, primetime drama and entertainment, and live BBC Sport events.
The channel was launched on 2 November 1936 under the name BBC Television Service, which was the world's first regular television service with a high level of image resolution.[b] It was renamed BBC TV in 1960 and used this name until the launch of the second BBC channel, BBC Two, in 1964. The main channel then became known as BBC1. The channel adopted the current spelling of BBC One in 1997.
The channel's annual budget for 2024–2025 was £1.28 billion.[1] It is funded by the television licence fee together with the BBC's other domestic television stations and shows uninterrupted programming without commercial advertising. The television channel had the highest reach share of any broadcaster in the United Kingdom as at 2019,[2] ahead of its traditional rival for ratings leadership ITV.[3] In 2013, a study conducted across 14 countries by the polling organisation Populus found BBC One to be the station most favourably viewed by its country, with BBC Two coming in third place.[4]
BBC One is available via most major television providers in the United Kingdom.
The BBC began its own regular television programming from the basement of Broadcasting House, London, on 22 August 1932. The channel officially began regular broadcasts on 2 November 1936 at three o'clock in the afternoon from a converted wing of the Alexandra Palace in London.[5]
On 1 September 1939, two days before Britain declared war on Germany, the station was taken off air with little warning, with the last programme to be shown being a Mickey Mouse cartoon (the 1933 short Mickey's Gala Premier);[6] the government was concerned that the VHF transmissions would act as a beacon to enemy aircraft that could bomb London.
BBC Television returned on 7 June 1946[7] at three o'clock in the afternoon. Jasmine Bligh, one of the original announcers, made the first announcement, saying, ""Good afternoon everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh?"". Twenty minutes later, BBC Television again aired the Mickey Mouse cartoon that they had broadcast in 1939.[8] The channel was made available outside of London for the first time on 17 December 1949, when the Sutton Coldfield transmitting station in the Midlands opened. The BBC hoped for the service to reach 70% of the British population by 1952, then 80% by 1954.[9]
The BBC held a statutory monopoly on television broadcasting in the United Kingdom until Associated-Rediffusion, the first Independent Television (ITV) station, began to broadcast on 22 September 1955. The competition quickly forced the channel to change its identity and priorities, following a large reduction in its audience, as noted in the 1962 Pilkington Report on the future of broadcasting. Simultaneously, the Pilkington Report decided to award an additional television station to the BBC on the basis that ITV was in comparison lacking in serious programming.[10]
BBC Television became BBC1 when BBC2 launched on 20 April 1964, transmitting an incompatible 625-line image on UHF. The only way to receive all channels was to use a complex ""dual-standard"" 405- and 625-line receiver with both a VHF and a UHF aerial (405-line-only sets became obsolete in 1985 when VHF transmissions ended). BBC1 moved to purpose-built facilities at Television Centre on 20 September 1969. Television News continued to use Alexandra Palace as its base and by early 1968 had even converted one of its studios to colour. In the weeks leading up to 15 November 1969, BBC1 unofficially transmitted the occasional programme in its new colour system in order to test it. At midnight on 15 November, simultaneously with ITV and two years after BBC2 had done so, BBC1 officially began 625-line PAL colour programming on UHF with a broadcast of a concert by Petula Clark.[12] Colour transmissions could be received in monochrome via monochrome 625-line sets until the end of analogue broadcasting.
Between 1973 and 1977, BBC1 achieved an average audience share of 45% under Bryan Cowgill.[13] This was the channel's most successful period in terms of audience share.
On 30 December 1980, the BBC announced plans to introduce a new breakfast television service to compete with TV-am. They stated that the new show would be broadcast before TV-am but included the caveat that the new show would not launch until at least November 1981, whereupon new licence fee income could finance the necessary extension of broadcasting hours. On 17 January 1983, one year after originally planned, the first edition of Breakfast Time was shown on BBC1, becoming the first UK wide breakfast television service[14] and continued to lead in the ratings until 1984.[15][16]
In 1984, Bill Cotton become managing director of Television at the BBC, and set about overhauling BBC1, which had been slated with poor home grown shows, its heavy reliance on US imports, with Dallas and The Thorn Birds being BBC1's highest rated programmes and ratings being over 20% behind ITV. Cotton recruited Michael Grade to become Controller of BBC1 from 1 September 1984[17][18] the first time the corporation had recruited someone outside of the BBC,[19] replacing Alan Hart, who had been criticised[by whom?] for his lack of knowledge in general entertainment, as he was head of BBC Sport prior to 1981.[citation needed]
The first major overhaul was to axe the unpopular Sixty Minutes current affairs programme: this was a replacement for the news and magazine show Nationwide. Its replacement was the BBC Six O'Clock News,[20][21] a straight news programme in a bid to shore up its failing early evening slot. It was believed the BBC were planning to cut short the evening news and move more light entertainment programming in from the 18:20 slot, but this was dismissed. The Miss Great Britain contest was dropped, being described as verging on the too offensive after the January 1985 contest, with World's Strongest Man and International Superstar also being cancelled.[22]
BBC1 was relaunched on 18 February 1985 with a new look, new programming including Wogan and EastEnders, and a revised schedule to help streamline and maintain viewers throughout the course of the evening. Grade started to gear most programmes to either on the hour or half past the hour, while Panorama and Omnibus were both moved after the Nine O'Clock News.[23] Grade was also determined to end the dated and inept BBC1 scheduling which was hampering the channel and holding back good programmes. Grade said ""When I took over BBC1, I discovered there were wonderful things, it was just a case of where to put them."" Wogan had been scheduled for a 10 pm slot, but Grade moved it to a 7 pm slot as he believed the show had potential.[24]
From February to August 1985, a high number of American mini-series were broadcast while filming took place of a number of new home grown programmes, including 'Allo 'Allo!, In Sickness and in Health, and Open All Hours. Further improvement came about when the corporation strengthened its drama output costing £30 million, with eight new series, including Howards' Way, All Creatures Great and Small, Hold the Back Page, and Bluebill, along with the return of Bergerac and Big Deal. The increase in the drama department was achieved by switching the money away from the administrative service over a three-year period, after BBC1 was criticised for failing to match ITV's output in drama.[25] EastEnders was moved to a 19:30 slot, where it managed to soar to 20 million, helping the BBC1 audience share increase to nearly 50% for the first time since 1982.
On 27 February 1985, Doctor Who was placed on an 18-month hiatus. The BBC originally planned to axe the series as they wished to spend its budgets on new programming for the channel, but was forced to back down from public pressure and Doctor Who returned in September 1986. At the time Michael Grade and Jonathan Powell were blamed for the decision (Grade was the target of death threats).[24]
On 9 September 1985, the long-standing children's programming block was overhauled and rebranded as Children's BBC, which gave it dedicated idents for the first time and had a live in-vision presenter, similar to rival ITV's Children's ITV block which had been running since January 1983. Previously the BBC had broadcast children's programming using BBC1's team of regular duty announcers. The launch presenter for this block, and thus the first Children's BBC presenter of the current format, was Phillip Schofield.
On 23 May 1986, long-running lunchtime magazine show Pebble Mill at One was broadcast for the last time after being on air for 14 years. On 27 October 1986, BBC1 launched its daytime television schedules.[26] In a statement, BBC Daytime head Roger Laughton said:
It was the natural extension of the corporation's commitment to public service broadcasting, since half the population had access to television during the day mainly the retired, unemployed and housewives.Stereo audio transmissions, using the NICAM digital stereo sound format began on BBC1 in late 1987, to coincide with the sale of the first consumer NICAM-enabled equipment, a year after BBC2, and were gradually phased in across BBC TV output, although it took until 31 August 1991 for the service to begin officially on both channels. During this time, both commercial analogue broadcasters, ITV and Channel 4 had officially begun stereo transmissions using the BBC-developed NICAM system. Widescreen programming was introduced on digital platforms in 1998.
For the first 50 years of its existence, with the exception of films and programmes purchased from the United States and elsewhere, almost all the channel's output were produced by the BBC's in-house production departments. This changed following the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990, which required that 25% of the BBC's television output be out-sourced to independent production companies.[27] By 2004, many popular BBC One shows were made for the channel by independents, but the in-house production departments continued to contribute heavily to the schedule.
In March 1991, as part of the £63 million programme package for spring and summer line up on BBC1, it was announced an extra £20 million was to be spent on rejuvenating the channels drama and comedy output during peak times, to keep the channel in a healthy state once the new Channel 3 licences were awarded.[28]
In December 1991 Wogan was to be cancelled, due to falling ratings against a number of ITV shows, in which Wogan only managed six million viewers compared to double that for This Is Your Life, The Krypton Factor and The $64,000 Question. Additionally an extra £40 million a year was spent on narrowing the gap on ITV's ratings lead, since a few months prior to this the channel had been criticised for its Autumn schedule, having tired formats, uninspiring scheduling of new programmes and poor scripts.[29] Wogan was replaced with Eldorado, in early July 1992, but this was itself cancelled a year later.
Alan Yentob launched the 1993 Autumn schedule calling it ""My first try with a lot of help from my friends"", with the channel still under criticism, following the start of new programming which Alan introduced a year earlier, and the number of summer repeats. £175 million was spent on 80 hours of original drama produced, enchantment to the arts with an extended 26-week run for Omnibus, and documentaries with The Downing Street Years, new wildlife series and an eight-month look at Sheffield's Children's hospital, while Goodnight Sweetheart, Grace & Favour and The Danny Baker Show were new comedy series.[30] Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman included in the Saturday night line up to increase variety.
Following the public disapproval of filling its schedule with 25% of repeats during the summer months of 1993, BBC1 agreed to broadcast an extra 110 hours worth of original programming over the same period during the summer in 1994, which included giving EastEnders an additional episode per week. Efficiency savings of £25 million were found and redeployed to the new productions. The savings were seen as a vindication for Producer Choice, the controversial internal market introduced in April 1993.[31][32]
By March 1999, the channel admitted defeat in its ratings war with ITV, with its spring line up emphasising more on serious factual and educational programmes, and drama. This change in strategy came about after continuing complaints that the channel was appealing to the lowest common denominator to increase viewership. Reliance on docusoaps and the dropping of the vilified Noel's House Party were chastened by the hoax guests on The Vanessa Show. Alan Yentob said ""The spring package is to remind people of what the BBC is here for, range and ambition you won't find anywhere else at peak time"". The changes helped the channel distinguish itself from (as one BBC executive said) ""its down-market rival and would not compete for viewers on ITV's terms.""[33]
Lorraine Heggessey became Controller of BBC One, a post she took up on 1 November 2000.[34][35] She had previously been sounded out about the job in 1997 after Michael Jackson's departure, but had turned down the opportunity as she felt she was then not yet experienced enough.[36]
During Heggessey's five years in charge, BBC One's audience share fell by 19.9%, to 23%, although this was in the context of declining audience figures across all British television channels due to increased competition from multichannel digital television.[37] However, in 2001 BBC One overtook its main rival ITV in terms of annual audience share for the first time since the rival channel had launched in 1955,[38] although much of this was down to the success of the channel's daytime television line-up, which had its own Controller: Jane Lush.[38]
When Heggessey arrived at the channel in November 2000, she inherited two controversial schedule changes which had been implemented the previous month, at the behest of Director-General of the BBC Greg Dyke; the Nine O'Clock News had been moved to the later time of 22:00 and Panorama moved from Monday night prime time slot to a later slot on Sunday nights.[39] The moving of Panorama attracted criticism that BBC One was sidelining serious programming in favour of more populist output.[40] Heggessey publicly defended the decision, despite it not being hers, claiming that Panorama's ratings would have ""dwindled"" in its previous slot.[39]
Heggessey and the BBC's Controller of Drama Commissioning, Jane Tranter, took advantage of the weekday 21:00 slot opening up by moving the news to commission new popular drama output, such as the successful Waking the Dead (2000–2011) and Spooks (2002–2011).[41] Celebrity dancing show Strictly Come Dancing (2004–present) was also a popular success on Saturday nights,[41] although another Saturday night entertainment series, Fame Academy, faced accusations of being too derivative of the output of commercial rivals, and during Heggessey's era the channel frequently came under attack for being too populist and not providing enough serious programming.[42]
Immediately after her arrival, Heggessey ordered a review of the ""Balloon"" idents the channel had been using for its between-programme idents since 1997. In her opinion, the balloon was ""slow and distant"" and so, on 29 March 2002, after much speculation, she decided to abandon the ""Balloon"" idents (and the traditional ""Globe"" idents the channel had used in a variety of forms since 1963). They were replaced by a new style of on-air identity for the channel, the ""Rhythm & Movement"" idents. The new idents attracted criticism for going against the traditions of the channel[43] and pandering to ""political correctness"", as they featured activities performed by people of various ethnicities.[44] The abandonment of a station clock, and perceived lack of a 'serious ident', also put the BBC in an embarrassing situation just one day into the new look with the death of the Queen Mother.
One of Heggessey's most notable decisions and last major success at the channel was the recommissioning of the science-fiction drama series Doctor Who, which had been a popular hit in previous decades but ceased production in 1989. Heggessey and Jane Tranter recommissioned the series in September 2003, after Heggessey had spent two years persuading the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, to abandon their attempts to make a feature film version of the programme and allow it to instead return it to BBC One.[45] The new version of Doctor Who (2005–present) debuted on 26 March 2005 and became a critical and popular hit,[46] with Paul Hoggart of The Times newspaper describing the series as ""a joyful, exuberant reinvention and a fine legacy from Ms Heggessey.""[47]
Heggessey did later concede in a 2005 interview with The Independent newspaper that arts programming had suffered a cutback under her control of BBC One.[35] However, she did respond to this omission following criticism from the Board of Governors of the BBC by commissioning programmes such as the arts documentary series Imagine... (2003–present) and A Picture of Britain (2005).[48]
On 14 February 2005 it was announced that Lorraine Heggessey was to leave the BBC to take up the post of Chief Executive at production company Talkback Thames.[48] She left on 15 April. Five months after her departure, BBC One was named ""Channel of the Year"" at the Edinburgh Television Festival, primarily on the strength of Heggessey's commissions such as Strictly Come Dancing and Doctor Who.[49]
Joining the channel as Controller in 2005, Peter Fincham oversaw the commissioning of several successful BBC One programmes including Robin Hood (2006–2009), Jane Eyre (2006) and How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?, which was followed by similar shows Any Dream Will Do and I'd Do Anything because of its success.[50] His first full year in charge of the channel saw a year-on-year growth in the audience share, with a rise from 22.2% in August 2005 to 23.6% in August 2006.[51]
Fincham also directly initiated the creation of both  The One Show (2006–present), an early evening, current-affairs and lifestyle magazine programme, which now runs all but two weeks of the year, and Davina (2006), a prime time chat show, the latter hosted by Davina McCall, who presented Big Brother.[52] However, Davina was a critical and ratings disaster,[53] which Fincham subsequently admitted was personally his fault, although he defended the strategy of experimenting with the BBC One schedule. This he continued in January 2007, when he moved the current affairs series Panorama from its Sunday night slot back to the prime time Monday evening slot from which it had been removed in 2000, most likely in response to a demand from the Board of Governors of the BBC for the channel to show more current affairs programming in prime time.[54]
Fincham's judgement was again called into question, this time by The Telegraph, for his decision to spend £1.2 million replacing the channel's 'Rhythm and Movement' idents, which had been introduced by his predecessor Lorraine Heggessey several years earlier, with the 'Circle' idents, a set of eight ten-second films, some of which were shot abroad in locations such as Mexico and Croatia.[55] Fincham later found himself having to publicly defend the £18 million salary that the BBC paid Jonathan Ross in 2006, although Ross's BBC One work—primarily consisting of Friday Night with Jonathan Ross—formed only part of his overall BBC commitment.[56]
The channel was named Channel of the Year at the 2007 Broadcast Awards.[57]
Following its rebrand in March 2002, BBC One launched The One to Watch campaign, during which animated blocks created the word ""The"" and moved into the BBC logo.
Each new campaign incorporating the theme retained the same animated sequence.
In May 2007, Fincham decided to drop Neighbours, an Australian soap opera, from BBC One after 21 years on the channel, when its producers, FremantleMedia significantly raised the price they wanted the BBC to pay for it in a bidding war.[58] Fincham commented that it was 'a big loss', but that BBC One would not pay 'the best part of £300 million'. Neighbours left the channel after the BBC's contract to show the programme ended on 8 February 2008, and moved to Channel 5 on 11 February 2008.[59] The Weakest Link was moved from BBC Two to fill the gap, with the afternoon CBBC slot moving 20 minutes earlier.
There was further controversy in July 2007 when Fincham was accused of misleading BBC One viewers. The incident involved a clip from forthcoming documentary A Year with the Queen which was shown to journalists during a press conference. It apparently showed the Queen storming out of a session with American photographer Annie Leibovitz over a disagreement about what she should wear, but the BBC subsequently admitted that the scenes used in the trailer had been edited out of their correct order, meaning that a false impression was given.[60] Fincham admitted the error, but rejected calls that he should resign from his position as a result.[61] His future was deemed uncertain following critical comments from Sir Michael Lyons, Chairman of the BBC Trust, and he resigned on 5 October 2007.[62]
In 2009, a report published by the BBC Trust found scheduling changes had led to a decrease in viewers.[63] This was especially noticeable for Blue Peter and Newsround, two of CBBC's flagship programmes; Blue Peter which recorded its lowest viewing numbers since it started in 1958, and Newsround with fewer than 100,000 viewers compared to 225,000 in 2007.[64][65]
As part of the Delivering Quality First proposals submitted by the BBC in October 2011 and approved by the BBC Trust in May 2012, all children's programming on BBC One and Two would be moved permanently to the CBBC and CBeebies channels following the digital switchover.[66] It was found that the majority of child viewers watched the programmes on these channels already and that only 7% of these children watched CBBC programmes on BBC One and Two only, it was made clear ""Children's programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere.""[67] Children's programming on BBC One ended on 21 December 2012.[68] The move was criticised by Teletubbies co-creator Anne Wood, who described the changes as ""ghettoising children's programmes"" and believe it was merely a cost-cutting measure. Wood said ""On the one hand it is inevitable. But it is dismissive of children. There is a certain amount of overlooking of the fact that children's programmes do get a wider audience than people are aware of ... I have frequently had letters from older people who have enjoyed my programmes as much as children do. A lot of the reason older people like to watch children's programming is because it is life-enhancing."" Head of BBC Children's, Joe Godwin said: ""Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already tune in to CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children's programmes. Far from being a 'cynical' move, we're just following where our audience has already gone.""[69]
As part of the review in 2012 other changes were brought in, including:
In 2012, the BBC out-bid ITV for the rights to air a British version of Dutch TV talent show The Voice. The BBC paid £22 million for the rights to broadcast the show in the UK for two years. The Voice UK achieved good ratings for the BBC but ratings dropped towards the end of the first series and the second series. In 2013, The Voice UK was rescheduled to avoid a clash, and as a result, ratings have improved. In November 2015, it was announced that The Voice UK would be moving to ITV from 2017, especially because of the ITV plc ownership of franchise owner, Talpa Media.
On 8 October 2013, the BBC announced plans to launch a one-hour time shift of the channel, named BBC One +1.[73] The channel would have replaced BBC Three in 2016. However, on 30 June 2015, the BBC Trust rejected the plans for a BBC One +1 channel as they stated that it would be at the expense of commercial rivals.[74]
BBC One HD, a simulcast of BBC One in 1080i high definition (HD), launched on 3 November 2010 at 19:00 with The One Show.[75] The channel simulcasts the national version of BBC One in High Definition, with HD versions of programmes including Doctor Who, Holby City, The One Show, Strictly Come Dancing and The Apprentice. EastEnders was also made available in HD from Christmas Day 2010. All programmes still made in standard definition were upscaled on the channel, with the intention that by 2012 the vast majority of the channel's output would be in high definition. On 30 May 2012,[citation needed] the satellite and terrestrial resolution was increased to full HD.
BBC One HD at launch did not offer regional variations, and therefore the channel could not broadcast during regional programming slots, most noticeably the local news programmes. The BBC Trust admitted that this was due to technical and financial constraints,[76] but the BBC announced on 6 June 2011 that the national variations of BBC One Northern Ireland, BBC One Scotland and BBC One Wales, would become available from 2012.[77][78] On 24 October 2012, Northern Ireland received the first variation. A Scottish variation launched on 14 January 2013, followed by a Welsh variation on 29 January 2013.[79] On 16 July 2013, the BBC indicated that it also wants to launch regional variants of BBC One HD across England; however, this would require the approval of the BBC Trust, with a proposal due to be presented within six months.[80] On 18 November 2013, the Northern Irish regional variant of BBC One HD was swapped with the SD channel on Sky's EPG for HD subscribers. This was followed by the Welsh and Scottish variants on 10 December.[81] On 24 March 2014, BBC One Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland HD launched on Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media outside the regions they were originally seen in.
On 31 March 2016, BBC One HD in England moved from channel 141 on the Sky electronic programme guide to channel 115, a position vacated by BBC Three, which had been switched to internet-only six weeks earlier. Changes in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland were also scheduled but delayed for 'technical reasons' and eventually BBC Two HD was moved to channel 115 in those regions.
[82]
On 22 November 2022, the BBC announced[83] that BBC One would finally be regionalised on their HD channels. This move started on Sky Glass, followed by Virgin Cable, and then in the 2023 new year, HD programmes were launched on satellite. With the launch of the HD channels, this also meant the closure of the SD channels. SD channels were shut on satellite 24 hours after the launch of the HD channel, and were moved up to the Channel 1/Channel 101 slot on the EPG. Viewers with older standard definition set-top boxes would no longer be able to receive BBC One. All BBC satellite channels in standard definition closed on 8 January 2024.
BBC Alba HD, BBC Red Button 1 HD and BBC Parliament HD also launched on satellite at a similar time.[84] The BBC and Freesat launched a website with a guide, telling users how to make sure they are upgraded at www.hdsatelliteupgrade.co.uk.
Regional programming began on BBC One HD in certain regions on 22 March 2023; it began in the remaining regions on 26 April 2023, as well as regionalised versions launching on Freeview that same day.
BBC One's remit is to be the BBC's most popular mixed-genre television service across the UK, offering a wide range of high quality programmes. It should be the BBC's primary outlet for major UK and international events and it should reflect the whole of the UK in its output. A very high proportion of its programmes should be original productions.— BBC One remit[85]Excluding sporting events and news coverage, the top five most watched programmes at their peak viewing points (according to BARB) were:[86]
With a mission to provide programmes for all licence-fee payers, it has sport, news, current affairs, and documentaries. It has historically broadcast children's programmes (now taken from CBBC and CBeebies). The channel remains one of the principal television channels in the United Kingdom and provides 2,508 annual hours of news and weather, 1,880 hours of factual and learning, 1,036 hours of drama, 672 hours of children's, 670 hours of sport, 654 hours of film, 433 hours of entertainment, 159 hours of current affairs, 92 hours of religion and 82 hours of music and arts.[92]
Since 1990, the BBC has had to commission output from other domestic suppliers. Although the statutory target remains 25% for independent production companies to contribute programming for BBC One, 33% of output was made by them in 2010–11.[93] The quota of original programming in peak times is set at 90%; however, 100% of peak programming was original in 2010–11.[93] Over the whole day, the total for the same year was 89%, against a quota of 70%.[93]
2,508 annual hours of news and weather (293 in peak, 1,049 of BBC News simulcasts) are provided by regular news programmes BBC News, BBC Business Today, BBC Newsday, Sportsday, BBC Breakfast, the BBC News at One, BBC News at Six and the BBC News at Ten each including BBC regional news programmes. All three main news bulletins have a lead over their rival programmes on ITV and other terrestrial or cable channels. During the weekend period, three separate bulletins around these three time periods are broadcast and vary in length from 10 to 25 minutes. BBC One has broadcast overnight simulcasts from the BBC News Channel since 1997; the latter in turn simulcasts the majority of all regular BBC One bulletins. When BBC One is broadcasting a BBC News special, it hands some of its daytime programming to BBC Two.
Each year 159 hours of current affairs programmes are broadcast on BBC One, including Panorama and Watchdog. Politics is also covered, with programmes including Question Time and This Week shown. Crimewatch, a programme appealing for help in unsolved crimes, is broadcast monthly.
BBC One shows 1,880 hours of factual and learning programming annually. This includes a wide range of shows such as nature documentaries such as Planet Earth as well as lifestyle-format daytime programmes and a number of reality television formats and the One Life strand.
BBC One broadcasts 1,036 hours of drama each year, more than any other BBC channel. There are four half-hour episodes of EastEnders each week (not shown on Friday), plus the hospital drama Casualty. Other popular dramas on BBC One include crime dramas such as New Tricks, a programme of which even episode repeats have beaten ITV ratings on numerous occasions.[94]
BBC One has traditionally been the home of children's television: Blue Peter had been broadcast on the channel prior to the Children's BBC strand, and sections such as the pre-school Watch with Mother being transmitted on the channel for several decades. This became more pronounced with the launch of Children's BBC, later renamed ""CBBC"". This new strand was broadcast primarily on BBC One in the late afternoons, as well as Saturday and Sunday mornings also such as Going Live! and Live & Kicking, each lasting two to three hours. The launch in 2002 of dedicated digital channels for this content —the CBBC and CBeebies channels —did not affect this provision. Combined with BBC Two, the channel broadcast 2,195 hours of children's programmes in 2010, mostly in the late afternoons on weekdays.[93] Saturday morning children's programming moved to BBC Two in 2006 following a three-month trial.[95]
Sports coverage on BBC One includes Premier League football highlights on Match of the Day, the Wimbledon Championships, the London Marathon, and other international athletics and swimming events, the Olympic Games, Rugby league, Rugby Union, Snooker tournaments, the American Super Bowl, and more.
The BBC showed the 2010 FIFA World Cup, splitting the group stage matches with ITV. The BBC had first pick of matches from the second round. Repeats made up 8.4% of peak programming in 2010–11, up from 8.0% for 2008–09.[93] Programming on this channel costs an average of £162,900 per hour.
British and international films are broadcast for 654 hours each year on BBC One. This is mainly late-night fillers with some box office hits at Christmas and holiday periods.
Sometimes on a Saturday afternoon there is a film on to fill the gap between entertainment shows but very rarely has there been one in that slot.
Entertainment programming on BBC One includes game shows such as the National Lottery, Total Wipeout, Strictly Come Dancing and chat shows such as The Graham Norton Show.
The annual 92 hours of religious programming comprise weekly editions of live Songs of Praise, Christian services and other shows from independent production companies. Mentorn Oxford produces Heart and Soul, described as ""a new multi-faith programme featuring a panel and a studio audience"", followed by Life from the Loft which is made by the Leeds-based company True North.[96] In 2005 BBC One was criticised for reducing the amount of religious programming, previously 101 hours per year.[97]
BBC One broadcasts many comedy programmes, often on Friday nights. These have included the stand-up comedy show Live at the Apollo, sitcom Outnumbered, and satirical quiz show Have I Got News for You.[98] Saturday evening is also a popular slot for a comedy show such as Michael McIntyre's Big Show and The Armstrong and Miller Show.
Since BBC Three became an online-only service in 2016, BBC One broadcast some BBC Three programming, particularly such as People Just Do Nothing, Cuckoo, RuPaul's Drag Race UK and This Country. In March 2019, BBC1 had a dedicated timeslot for BBC3 as a programming block. The block was dropped when BBC Three returned as a linear TV channel in early 2022, but BBC One continues to broadcast some BBC Three programmes.
As the weekly popular music chart programme Top of the Pops was dropped in 2006 (except for the Christmas Day edition), BBC One broadcast 49 hours of music and arts programming in 2010.[93] The majority of this was Imagine, presented by Alan Yentob, and classical music concerts, in particular some of the BBC Proms.
BBC One's daytime line-up was a major factor in it overtaking ITV as the most popular channel in 2000, a position it has retained, even though ITV achieves a higher audience share during the daytime.[99] The morning daytime line-up consists of lifestyle shows, such as Morning Live, Homes Under the Hammer and Bargain Hunt, the afternoons contain drama with daily soap Doctors and classic US drama, such as Diagnosis: Murder. Sometimes a drama such as Land Girls is shown in the afternoons.
Between 15:25 and 17:35 was the CBeebies/CBBC broadcasting strand, with its own visual identity. Historically, BBC One's most popular daytime programme was Neighbours, with audience figures approaching five million. On 11 February 2008, BBC One dropped Neighbours and the programme was  broadcast on Channel 5[100] until 2022. In its place was the quiz show The Weakest Link, which was moved from BBC Two, and later replaced in 2011 by Pointless. Children's programmes were broadcast from 15:05 - 17:15 to accommodate this change and this continued until December 2012 when the afternoon CBeebies/CBBC block was axed.
On 16 May 2012, the BBC announced the children's block of shows would be moved permanently to CBBC and CBeebies upon the completion of the Digital switchover.[101] In its place appear the game show Perfection, plus Escape to the Country and Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is.
In February 2022, the BBC confirmed that EastEnders will get a Monday to Thursday slot at 7.30pm with the programme due to form part of a BBC soap hour which will include a repeat of daytime soap Doctors on BBC Two at 7pm.[102] Due to this decision, the BBC One regional slot will be pushed back half an hour to 8pm on Wednesdays, where it will feature programmes such as documentary series We Are England.[103][104]
BBC One's identity has been symbolised by a globe shown on its idents for much of its existence.[105] The first BBC ident was shown on 2 December 1953, known as the Bat's Wings. In 1962 this was replaced by a map of the UK shown between programmes, and in 1963 the globe appeared, changing in style and appearance over the next 39 years.
Most notably, on 18 February 1985, the ""Computer Originated World"" was introduced. This was a computer-animated globe with the land coloured gold and the sea a transparent blue, giving the impression of a glass globe. This was replaced by the ""Virtual Globe"" on 16 February 1991. On 4 October 1997, the globe became a red, orange and yellow hot-air balloon, coloured to resemble a globe. It was filmed flying around various places in the UK.
On 29 March 2002, the globe was replaced by a series of visual identities, ""idents"", consisting of people dancing in various styles. These were replaced on 7 October 2006 by the 'circle' idents. According to the BBC, the circle symbol both represents togetherness (unity) and acts as a link to the classic globe icon used for 39 years.[106] They ran until 4 December 2016, when that year's Christmas idents launched. On 1 January 2017, a new ident set launched, based on the theme of ""oneness"".[107][108] Following complaints from viewers on social media that the 2017 set of BBC One idents were not good examples of social distancing amid the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic in the UK, BBC One temporarily suspended the 2017 idents on 1 May 2020 in favour of a special set of idents that adhere towards the social distancing guidelines.[109] The idents were reinstated on 19 July 2021 when the UK government lifted some Coronavirus restrictions until the new Lens idents arrived the following year on 1 April 2022.
BBC One has individual continuity and opt-outs for Scotland,[110] Wales[111] and Northern Ireland.[112] Each variant maintains the BBC One logo with the addition of the constituent country name beneath it.
In England,[113] each region has an individual regional news and current affairs programme opt-out as well as a limited amount of continuity. UK Today, a news programme, was shown nationally to digital viewers in place of regional programmes when they were unavailable to broadcast on analogue television. The programme was discontinued in 2002 and replaced by a transmission of BBC London News until all BBC regions were made available digitally.
BBC One Scotland has the greatest level of variation from the generic channel, owing to BBC Scotland scheduling Scottish programming on the main BBC Scotland channel, rather than on BBC Two Scotland which closed in 2019. BBC One Scotland variations include the soap opera River City and the football programme Sportscene, the inclusion of which causes programming to be displaced or replaced.
BBC One Wales was considered a separate channel by the BBC as early as its launch in the mid-1960s, appearing as BBC Wales.[114]
BBC One (Northern Ireland) is widely available in Ireland on cable and satellite television. BBC One (especially the London feed) is also available on cable and IPTV in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Monaco and Liechtenstein. The channel is registered to broadcast within the European Union/EEA through the Luxembourgish Broadcasting Regulator – ALIA.[115][116]
On 27 March 2013 it was offered by British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) to members of HM Forces and their families around the world, replacing the BFBS1 TV channel, which already carried a selection of BBC One programmes.[117]
All feeds of BBC One in both SD and HD are broadcast unencrypted on the Astra 2E and 2G satellites, allowing viewing across Belgium, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and parts of France, Germany and Spain.[118][119]
The BBC announced in May 2008 that it had achieved its aim for all programming to have subtitles for viewers with hearing difficulties.[120][121] The BBC also offers audio description on some popular BBC One programmes[122] for visually impaired viewers. The percentage of the BBC's total television output with audio description available is 10%, having been increased from 8% in 2008.[123]
In 2016, the controller of BBC One would be promoted to oversee all BBC channels,[125] with the channel controller roles being entirely scrapped in 2020, in favour of a focus on digital streaming.[126]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Cathedral,Liverpool Cathedral,"
Liverpool Cathedral is a Church of England cathedral in the city of Liverpool, England. It is the seat of the bishop of Liverpool and is the mother church of the diocese of Liverpool. The church may be formally referred to as the Cathedral Church of Christ in Liverpool.[1] It is the largest cathedral and religious building in Britain,[2] and the eighth largest church in the world.
The cathedral is based on a design by Giles Gilbert Scott and was constructed between 1904 and 1978. It is the longest cathedral in the world;[3] the total external length of the building, including the Lady Chapel (dedicated to the Blessed Virgin), is 621 feet (189 m), its internal length is 480 feet (150 m). In terms of overall volume, Liverpool Cathedral ranks as the fifth-largest cathedral in the world[4] and contests with the incomplete Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City for the title of largest Anglican church building.[5] With a height of 331 feet (101 m) it is also one of the world's tallest non-spired church buildings and the fourth-tallest structure in the city of Liverpool. The cathedral is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building.[6]
The Anglican cathedral is one of two cathedrals in the city. The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King is situated approximately 0.5 miles (0.8 km) to the north. The cathedrals are linked by Hope Street, which takes its name from William Hope, a local merchant whose house stood on the site now occupied by the Philharmonic Hall, and was named long before either cathedral was built.
J. C. Ryle was installed as the first Bishop of Liverpool in 1880, but the new diocese had no cathedral, merely a ""pro-cathedral"", the parish church of St Peter in Church Street. St Peter's was unsatisfactory; it was too small for major church events, and moreover was, in the words of the Rector of Liverpool, ""ugly & hideous"".[7] The Liverpool Cathedral Act 1885 (48 & 49 Vict. c. li) authorised the building of a cathedral on the site of the existing St John's Church, adjacent to St George's Hall.[8] A competition was held for the design, and won by William Emerson. The site proved unsuitable for the erection of a building on the scale proposed, and the scheme was abandoned.[8]
In 1900 Francis Chavasse succeeded Ryle as Bishop, and immediately revived the project to build a cathedral.[9] There was some opposition from among members of Chavasse's diocesan clergy, who maintained that there was no need for an expensive new cathedral. The architectural historian John Thomas argues that this reflected ""a measure of factional strife between Liverpool Anglicanism's very Evangelical or Low Church tradition, and other forces detectable within the religious complexion of the new diocese.""[10] Bishop Chavasse, though himself an Evangelical, regarded the building of a great church as ""a visible witness to God in the midst of a great city"".[10] He pressed ahead, and appointed a committee under William Forwood to consider all possible sites. The St John's site being ruled out, Forwood's committee identified four locations: St Peter's and St Luke's, which were, like St John's, found to be too restricted; a triangular site at the junction of London Road and Monument Place;[n 1] and St James's Mount.[11] There was considerable debate about the competing merits of the two possible sites, and Forwood's committee was inclined to favour the London Road triangle. However, the cost of acquiring it was too great, and the St James's Mount site was recommended.[11] An historian of the cathedral, Vere Cotton, wrote in 1964:
Looking back after an interval of sixty years, it is difficult to realise that any other decision was even possible. With the exception of Durham, no English cathedral is so well placed to be seen to advantage both from a distance and from its immediate vicinity. That such a site, convenient to yet withdrawn from the centre of the city … dominating the city and clearly visible from the river, should have been available is not the least of the many strokes of good fortune which have marked the history of the cathedral.[11]Fund-raising began, and new enabling legislation was passed by Parliament. The Liverpool Cathedral Act 1902 (2 Edw. 7. c. ccxxxi) authorised the purchase of the site and the building of a cathedral, with the proviso that as soon as any part of it opened for public worship, St Peter's Church should be demolished and its site sold to provide the endowment of the new cathedral's chapter. St Peter's place as Parish Church of Liverpool would be taken by the existing church of St Nicholas near the Pier Head.[11] St Peter's Church closed in 1919, and was finally demolished in 1922.[12]
In late 1901, two well-known architects were appointed as assessors for an open competition for architects wishing to be considered for the design of the cathedral.[13] George Frederick Bodley was a leading exponent of the Gothic Revival style, and a former pupil and relative by marriage of Sir George Gilbert Scott.[14] Richard Norman Shaw was an eclectic architect, having begun in the Gothic style, and later favouring what his biographer Andrew Saint calls ""full-blooded classical or imperial architecture"".[15]
Architects were invited by public advertisement to submit portfolios of their work for consideration by Bodley and Shaw. From these, the two assessors selected a first shortlist of architects to be invited to prepare drawings for the new building. It was stipulated that the designs were to be in the Gothic style.[16] Robert Gladstone, a member of the committee to which the assessors were to report said, ""There could be no question that Gothic architecture produced a more devotional effect upon the mind than any other which human skill had invented.""[17] This condition caused controversy. Reginald Blomfield and others protested at the insistence on a Gothic style, a ""worn-out flirtation in antiquarianism, now relegated to the limbo of art delusions.""[18] An editorial in The Times observed, ""To impose a preliminary restriction is unwise and impolitic … the committee must not hamper itself at starting with a condition which is certain to exclude many of the best men.""[19] Eventually it was agreed that the assessors would also consider ""designs of a Renaissance or Classical character"".[20]
For architects, the competition was an important event; not only was it for one of the largest building projects of its time, but it was only the third opportunity to build an Anglican cathedral in England since the Reformation in the 16th century (St Paul's Cathedral being the first, rebuilt from scratch after the Great Fire of London in 1666, and Truro Cathedral being the second, begun in the 19th century).[20] The competition attracted 103 entries,[20] from architects including Temple Moore, Charles Rennie Mackintosh,[21] Charles Reilly,[22] and Austin and Paley.[23]
In 1903, the assessors recommended a proposal submitted by the 22-year-old Giles Gilbert Scott, who was still an articled pupil working in Temple Moore's practice,[24] and had no existing buildings to his credit. He told the assessors that so far his only major work had been to design a pipe-rack.[25] The choice of winner was even more contentious with the Cathedral Committee when it was discovered that Scott was a Roman Catholic,[n 2] but the decision stood.[24]
Although young, Scott was steeped in ecclesiastical design and well versed in the Gothic revival style, his grandfather, Sir Gilbert Scott, and father, George Gilbert Scott, Jr., having designed numerous churches.[26] George Bradbury, the surveyor to the Cathedral Committee, reported, ""Mr. Scott seems to have inherited the architectural genius so marked in the Scott family for the last three or four generations ... He is very pleasant, agreeable, enthusiastic, tall and looks considerably older than he actually is.""[10] Appearances notwithstanding, Scott's inexperience prompted the Cathedral Committee to appoint Bodley to oversee the detailed architectural design and building work. Work began without delay. The foundation stone was laid by King Edward VII in 1904.[7] Sir Frederick Radcliffe, known as the 'Father of the Cathedral' was chief executive of the building committee from 1913-1934 and supported  Scott's appointment.[27]
Cotton observes that it was generous of Bodley to enter into a working relationship with a young and untried student.[28] Bodley had been a close friend of Scott's father, but his collaboration with the young Scott was fractious, especially after Bodley accepted commissions to design two cathedrals in the US,[n 3] necessitating frequent absences from Liverpool.[24] Scott complained that this ""has made the working partnership agreement more of a farce than ever, and to tell the truth my patience with the existing state of affairs is about exhausted"".[24] Scott was on the point of resigning when Bodley died suddenly in 1907, leaving him in charge.[29] The Cathedral Committee appointed Scott sole architect, and though it reserved the right to appoint another co-architect, it never seriously considered doing so.[10]
In 1909, free of Bodley and growing in confidence, Scott submitted an entirely new design for the main body of the cathedral.[30] His original design had two towers at the west end[n 4] and a single transept; the revised plan called for a single central tower 85.344 metres (280.00 ft) high, topped with a lantern and flanked by twin transepts.[32][n 5] The Cathedral Committee, shaken by such radical changes to the design they had approved, asked Scott to work his ideas out in fine detail and submit them for consideration.[30] He worked on the plans for more than a year, and in November 1910, the committee approved them.[30] In addition to the change in the exterior, Scott's new plans provided more interior space.[34] At the same time Scott modified the decorative style, losing much of the Gothic detailing and introducing a more modern, monumental style.[35]
The Lady Chapel (originally intended to be called the Morning Chapel),[10] the first part of the building to be completed, was consecrated in 1910 by Bishop Chavasse in the presence of two Archbishops and 24 other Bishops.[36] The date, 29 June—St Peter's Day—was chosen to honour the pro-cathedral, now due to be demolished.[37] The Manchester Guardian described the ceremony:
The Bishop of Liverpool knocked on the door with his pastoral staff, saying in a loud voice, ""Open ye the gates."" The doors having been flung open, the Earl of Derby, resplendent in the golden robes of the Chancellor of Liverpool University, presented Dr. Chavasse with the petition for consecration. … The Archbishop of York, whose cross was carried before him and who was followed by two train-bearers clad in scarlet cassocks, was conducted to the sedilla and the rest of the Bishops, with the exception of Dr. Chavasse, who knelt before his episcopal chair in the sanctuary, found accommodation in the choir stalls.[38]The richness of the décor of the Lady Chapel may have dismayed some of Liverpool's Evangelical clergy. Thomas suggests that they were confronted with ""a feminised building which lacked reference to the 'manly' and 'muscular Christian' thinking which had emerged in reaction to the earlier feminisation of religion.""[10] He adds that the building would have seemed to many to be designed for Anglo-Catholic worship.[10]
The décor includes a stained glass featuring women of various backgrounds and professions, who are considered to have contributed significantly to society. These include:[39]
Work was severely limited during the First World War, with a shortage of manpower, materials and donations.[40] By 1920, the workforce had been brought back up to strength and the stone quarries at Woolton, source of the pinkish-red sandstone for most of the building, reopened.[40] The first section of the main body of the cathedral was complete by 1924. It comprised the chancel, an ambulatory, chapter house and vestries.[41] The section was closed with a temporary wall, and on 19 July 1924, the 20th anniversary of the laying of the foundation stone, the cathedral was consecrated in the presence of King George V and Queen Mary, and Archbishops and Bishops from around the globe.[40] Major works ceased for a year while Scott once again revised his plans for the next section of the building: the tower, the under-tower and the central transept.[42] The tower in his final design was higher and narrower than his 1910 conception.[43]
From July 1925 work continued steadily, and it was hoped to complete the whole section by 1940.[44] The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 caused similar problems to those of the earlier war. The workforce dwindled from 266 to 35; moreover, the building was damaged by German bombs during the May Blitz.[45] Despite these vicissitudes, the central section was complete enough by July 1941 to be handed over to the Dean and Chapter. Scott laid the last stone of the last pinnacle on the tower on 20 February 1942.[46] No further major works were undertaken during the rest of the war. Scott produced his plans for the nave in 1942, but work on it did not begin until 1948.[47] The bomb damage, particularly to the Lady Chapel, was not fully repaired until 1955.[48]
Scott died in 1960. The first bay of the nave was then nearly complete, and was handed over to the Dean and Chapter in April 1961. Scott was succeeded as architect by Frederick Thomas.[49] Thomas, who had worked with Scott for many years, drew up a new design for the west front of the cathedral. The Guardian commented, ""It was an inflation beater, but totally in keeping with the spirit of the earlier work, and its crowning glory is the Benedicite Window designed by Carl Edwards and covering 1,600 sq. ft.""[50]
The version recorded in Gavin Stamp's obituary of Richard Gilbert Scott, which appeared in The Guardian on 15 July 2017, differs slightly: ""When his father died the following year (1960), Richard inherited the practice and was left to complete several jobs. He continued with the great work of building Liverpool Cathedral but, after adding two bays of the nave (using cheaper materials: concrete and fibreglass), he resigned when it was proposed drastically to alter his father's design. The cathedral was eventually completed with a much simplified and diminished west end drawn out by his father's former assistant, Roger Pinckney"".[51]
The completion of the building was marked by a service of thanksgiving and dedication in October 1978, attended by Queen Elizabeth II. In the spirit of ecumenism that had been fostered in Liverpool, The Most Rev. Derek Worlock, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool, played a major part in the ceremony.[52]
In October 2021, the building was one of 142 sites across England to receive part of a £35-million injection into the government's Culture Recovery Fund.[53]
As of 8 December 2020:[54]
The cathedral's official website gives the dimensions of the building as
The cathedral was built mainly of local sandstone quarried from the South Liverpool suburb of Woolton. The last sections (The Well of the Cathedral at the west end in the 1960s and 1970s) used the closest matching sandstone that could be found from other NW quarries once the supply from Woolton had been exhausted.
Each of the stone blocks on the cathedral's interior has different dimensions to those next to it, said to be symbolic of God's love for individuals.[3]
The belltower is the largest, and also one of the tallest, in the world (see List of tallest churches in the world). It houses the world's highest (67 m (220 ft)) and heaviest (16.5 long tons (16.8 tonnes)) ringing peal of bells, and the third-heaviest bell (14.5 long tons (14.7 tonnes)) in the United Kingdom.[61]
The cathedral is open daily all year round from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm (except Christmas Day, when it closes to the public at 3 pm), and regular services are held every day of the week at 8:30 am: Morning Prayer (Holy Communion on Sundays). 12:05 pm Monday–Saturday (Communion) and Monday–Friday at 5:30pm (Evensong or said Evening Prayer according to day and time of year). At the weekend, there is also a 3pm Evensong service on Saturdays and Sundays with a main Cathedral Eucharist at 10:30 am, which attracts a large core congregation each week. It also has a more intimate Communion on Sundays at 4 pm. Since early 2011, the cathedral has also offered a regular, more informal form of cafe-style worship called ""Zone 2"", running parallel to its main Sunday Eucharist each week and held in the lower rooms in the Giles Gilbert Scott Function Suite (formerly the Western Rooms). The core services at 5:30pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10:30am on Sundays and 3pm Saturdays and Sundays are supported on each occasion during term time by the cathedral choir.[62]
Following the closure of their building in Rodney Street in 1975, the Liverpool St. Andrew's congregation of the Church of Scotland used the Radcliffe Room of the cathedral for Sunday services. The congregation finally disbanded in November 2016.[63]
Admission to the cathedral is free, but with a suggested donation of £5.[n 6] Car parking is available on-site on a pay-on-exit basis. Parking is free for attendance at all services. Access to the main floor of the cathedral is restricted during services and some of the major events.[64]
The building also plays host to a wide range of events and special services including concerts, academic events involving local schools, graduations, exhibitions, family activities, seminars, conferences, corporate events, commemorative services, anniversary services and many more. Its maximum capacity for any major event including special services is 3,500 standing, or about 2,300 fully seated. The ground floor of the cathedral is fully accessible.
Liverpool Cathedral has its own specialist constabulary to keep watch on an all-year 24-hour basis. The Liverpool Cathedral Constables together with the York Minster Police and several other cathedrals' constable units are members of the Cathedral Constables' Association.[65]
Liverpool Cathedral also features on a page of the latest design of the British passport.[66]
At 67 m (220 ft) above floor level, the bells of Liverpool Cathedral are the highest and heaviest ringing peal in the world.
[n 7] Two lifts are provided for the use of the bellringers and other visitors to the tower. The peal proper (hung for full-circle change ringing) consists of thirteen bells weighing a total of 16.5 long tons (16.8 tonnes), which are named the Bartlett Bells after Thomas Bartlett (died 4 September 1912), a native of Liverpool who bequeathed the funding.[67] The bells vary in size and note from the comparatively light 10 long cwt (510 kilograms) treble to the tenor weighing 4 long tons (4.1 tonnes). The 13th bell (sharp 2nd) is extra to the main 12-bell peal, and its purpose is to make possible ringing in a correct octave on lighter bells.[68] All thirteen bells were cast by Mears & Stainbank of Whitechapel in London.[69] The initial letters of the inscriptions on the thirteen bells spell out the name ""Thomas Bartlett"" (from tenor to treble).[70]
The Bartlett bells are hung in a circle around the bourdon bell ""Great George"".[n 8] At 14.5 long tons (14.7 tonnes), Great George is the third most massive bell in the British Isles; only the 16.5 long tons (16.8 tonnes) ""Great Paul"" of St Paul's Cathedral in London, and the 2012 Olympic Bell (22.91 tonnes) are heavier. However, as the Olympic bell is never rung,[71] Great George is currently the second largest working bell in the British Isles. Great George, cast by Taylors of Loughborough and named in memory of George V, is hung in a pendant position and is sounded by means of a counterbalanced clapper.[72]
The organ, built by Henry Willis & Sons, is the largest pipe organ in the UK, and one of the largest musical instruments in the world. It has two five-manual consoles (one sited high up in one of the organ cases and the other, a mobile console, on the floor of the cathedral), 10,268 pipes and a trompette militaire.[73] There is an annual anniversary recital on the Saturday nearest to 18 October, the date of the organ's consecration. There is a separate two-manual Willis organ in the Lady Chapel.[74][75]
In 1931, Scott asked Edward Carter Preston to produce a series of sculptures for Liverpool Cathedral. The project was an immense undertaking which occupied the artist for the next thirty years. The work for the cathedral included fifty sculptures, ten memorials and several reliefs. Many inscriptions in the cathedral were jointly written by Dean Dwelly and the sculptor who subsequently carved them.
To celebrate Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee in 1977, Mary Farmer was commissioned to weave 6 kneelers for the Nave Altar.[77]
In 1993, ""The Welcoming Christ"", a large bronze sculpture by Dame Elisabeth Frink, was installed over the outside of the west door of the cathedral.[78] This was one of her last completed works, installed within days of her death.[79]
In 2003, the Liverpool artist, Don McKinlay, who knew Carter Preston from his youth, was commissioned by the cathedral to model an infant Christ to accompany the 15th century Madonna by Giovanni della Robbia Madonna now situated in the Lady Chapel.[80]
In 2008, a work entitled ""For You"" by Tracey Emin was installed at the west end of the cathedral below the Benedicite window. The pink neon sign reads ""I felt you and I knew you loved me"", and was installed when Liverpool became European Capital of Culture. The work was originally intended to be a temporary installation for one month as part of the Capital of Culture programme, but is now a permanent feature.[78]
Another work by Emin, ""The Roman Standard"" takes the form of a small bronze sparrow on a metal pole, and was installed in 2005 outside the Oratory Chapel close to the west end of the cathedral.[81] The sparrow was stolen (twice) in 2008, but on both occasions was returned and replaced.[82]
The 15-feet high 2011 crucifixion sculpture The Outraged Christ by Charles Lutyens is on permanent display in the cathedral.[83]
Cefyn Burgess was commissioned around 2018 to design and weave new fabrics for the cathedral based on the songs of Solomon including altar cloths and kneelers.[84][85]
In 2024, to mark what was described in the press as its ""100th anniversary"", the cathedral hosted a show by sculptor Anish Kapoor. He said:
""To show works in Liverpool Cathedral is complex. It is a space that is alive both with the physical and spiritual. As such it is resonant with a powerful sense of body and the disembodied. The works that I have chosen to show in the cathedral are situated similarly between body and materiality and geometric immaterial which I refer to as the non-object. It is my hope that this conjunction of object and non-object here in this immense and potent space will be cause for reflection on the nature of religious experience and the human condition.""[86]The firm of James Powell and Sons (Whitefriars), Ltd., of London, provided most of the stained glass designs. John William Brown (1842–1928) designed the Te Deum window in the east end of the cathedral, as well as the original windows for the Lady Chapel, which was heavily damaged during German bombing raids in 1940. The glass in the Lady Chapel was replaced with designs, based on the originals, by James Humphries Hogan (1883–1948). He was one of the most prolific of the Powell and Sons designers; his designs can also be seen in the large north and south windows in the central space of the cathedral (each 100 feet tall). Later artists include William Wilson (1905–1972), who began his work at Liverpool Cathedral after the death of Hogan, Herbert Hendrie (1887–1946), and Carl Edwards (1914–1985), who designed the Benedicite window in the west front. The cathedral has approximately 1,700 m2 of stained glass.[87]
Bishop Chavasse and Sir Giles Gilbert Scott are buried in the precinct of the cathedral, the former in Founder's Plot, and the latter at the west end of the site.[88] Clergy buried within the cathedral include the bishops Albert David and David Sheppard. Among the benefactors whose remains are buried in the cathedral are The 1st Baron Vestey and his brother, Sir Edmund Vestey, and Sir Frederick Morton Radcliffe and his wife Lady Maggie Radcliffe. The ashes of the donor of the cathedral bells, Thomas Bartlett, are interred in a casket in the ringing room.[88] At the rear of the memorial to the 55th (West Lancashire) Division rest the ashes of Lieutenant-General Sir Hugh Jeudwine, who commanded the division from its formation in 1916 until the end of the First World War.[89] Victoria Cross recipient Sergeant Arthur Herbert Lindsay Richardson is buried here, having been re-interred from the St. James Cemetery.[90]
An original painting of the cathedral by Judy Joel appears on the First Class stamp in the Royal Mail's 2024 series of special Christmas stamps.[91]

The Daily Express is a national daily United Kingdom middle-market newspaper[6] printed in tabloid format. Published in London, it is the flagship of Express Newspapers, owned by publisher Reach plc. It was first published as a broadsheet in 1900 by Sir Arthur Pearson. Its sister paper, the Sunday Express, was launched in 1918. In June 2022, it had an average daily circulation of 201,608.[7]
Under the ownership of Lord Beaverbrook, the Express rose to become the newspaper with the largest circulation in the world, going from 2 million in the 1930s to 4 million in the 1940s.[8] It was acquired by Richard Desmond's company Northern & Shell in 2000. Hugh Whittow was the editor from February 2011 until he retired in March 2018. In February 2018 Trinity Mirror acquired the Daily Express, and other publishing assets of Northern & Shell, in a deal worth £126.7 million. To coincide with the purchase the Trinity Mirror group changed the name of the company to Reach.[9][10] Hugh Whittow resigned as editor and Gary Jones took over as editor-in-chief soon after the purchase.[11]
The paper's editorial stances have often been seen as aligned to Euroscepticism and supportive of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), and other right-wing factions including the European Research Group (ERG) of the Conservative Party.[12][13]
The Daily Express was founded in 1900 by Sir Arthur Pearson, with the first issue appearing on 24 April 1900.[14] Pearson lost his sight to glaucoma in 1913,[15] and sold the title to the future Lord Beaverbrook in 1916.[16]
The Express was one of the first papers to place news instead of advertisements on its front page,[16] and carried gossip, sport, and women's features. It was also the first in Britain to have a crossword puzzle.
It began printing in Manchester in 1927. In 1931 it moved its London headquarters to 120 Fleet Street, a specially commissioned Art Deco building. Under Beaverbrook, the paper set newspaper sales records several times throughout the 1930s.[17] Its success was partly due to aggressive marketing campaign and a circulation war with other populist newspapers.[18] Arthur Christiansen became editor in October 1933. Under his direction sales climbed from two million in 1936 to four million in 1949. He retired in 1957.[19] The paper also featured Alfred Bestall's Rupert Bear cartoon[20] and satirical cartoons by Carl Giles which it began publishing in the 1940s.[21] On 24 March 1933, a front-page headline, ""Judea Declares War on Germany"" (because of the Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933), was published.[22][23]
During the late 1930s, the paper advocated the appeasement policies of Neville Chamberlain's National Government, due to the influence of Lord Beaverbrook.[24] On 7 August 1939, the front-page headline was ""NO WAR THIS YEAR"". Less than a month later, Britain and France were at war with Nazi Germany following its invasion of Poland. The front page, floating in dirty water, later featured in In Which We Serve.
The ruralist and fascist author Henry Williamson wrote for the paper on many occasions over a span of half a century.[25] He also wrote for the Sunday Express at the beginning of his career.[26]
In 1938, the publication moved to the Daily Express Building, Manchester (nicknamed the ""Black Lubyianka""), designed by Owen Williams on the same site in Great Ancoats Street.[27] It opened a similar building in Glasgow in 1936 in Albion Street. Glasgow printing ended in 1974[28] and Manchester in 1989 on the company's own presses.[29] Johnston Press has a five-year deal, begun in March 2015, to print the northern editions of the Daily Express, Daily Star, Sunday Express and the Daily Star Sunday at its Dinnington site in Sheffield.[30] The Scottish edition is printed by facsimile in Glasgow by contract printers, the London editions at Westferry Printers.[31]
In March 1962, Beaverbrook was attacked in the House of Commons for running ""a sustained vendetta"" against the British Royal Family in the Express titles.[32] In the same month, the Duke of Edinburgh described the Express as ""a bloody awful newspaper. It is full of lies, scandal and imagination. It is a vicious paper.""[33] At the height of Beaverbrook's control, in 1948, he told a Royal Commission on the press that he ran his papers ""purely for the purpose of making propaganda"".[34][35] The arrival of television, and the public's changing interests, took their toll on circulation, and following Beaverbrook's death in 1964, the paper's circulation declined for several years. During this period, the Express, practically alone among mainstream newspapers, was vehemently opposed to entry into what became the European Economic Community.[17]
""[I run the paper] purely for the purpose of making propaganda and with no other motive"".
Partially as a result of the rejuvenation of the Daily Mail under David English and the emergence of The Sun under Rupert Murdoch and editorship of Larry Lamb, average daily sales of the Express dropped below four million in 1967, below three million in 1975, and below two million in 1984.[36]  The Daily Express switched from broadsheet to tabloid in 1977[37] (the Mail having done so six years earlier), and was bought by the construction company Trafalgar House in the same year.[38] Its publishing company, Beaverbrook Newspapers, was renamed Express Newspapers.[39] In 1982, Trafalgar House spun off its publishing interests to a new company, Fleet Holdings, under Lord Matthews, but this succumbed to a hostile takeover by United Newspapers in 1985.[40] Under United, the Express titles moved from Fleet Street to Blackfriars Road in 1989.[41]
Express Newspapers was sold to publisher Richard Desmond in 2000, and the names of the newspapers reverted to Daily Express and Sunday Express.[citation needed] In 2004, the newspaper moved to Lower Thames Street in the City of London.[17] In February 2018, it moved into 1 Canada Square in Canary Wharf.
On 31 October 2005, UK Media Group Entertainment Rights secured majority interest from the Daily Express for Rupert Bear. They paid £6 million for a 66.6% control of the character. The Express retains minority interest of one-third plus the right to publish Rupert Bear stories in certain Express publications.[42]
In 2000, Express Newspapers was bought by Richard Desmond, publisher of celebrity magazine OK!, for £125 million. Controversy surrounded the deal since Desmond also owned softcore pornography magazines.[43] As a result, many staff left, including editor Rosie Boycott and columnist Peter Hitchens.[44] Hitchens moved to The Mail on Sunday, saying working for the new owner was a moral conflict of interest since he had always attacked the pornographic magazines that Desmond published.[45] Despite their divergent politics, Desmond respected Hitchens.[46]
In 2007, Express Newspapers left the National Publishers Association due to unpaid fees.[47] Since payments to the NPA fund the Press Complaints Commission, it is possible that the Express and its sister papers could cease being regulated by the PCC. The chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, which manages PCC funds, described Express Newspapers as a ""rogue publisher"".[48]
The Express group lost prominent libel cases in 2008–2009; it paid damages to people involved in the Madeleine McCann case (see below), a member of the Muslim Council of Britain, footballer Marco Materazzi, and sports agent Willie McKay. The losses led the media commentator Roy Greenslade to conclude that Express Newspapers (which also publishes the Star titles) paid more in libel damages over that period than any other newspaper group. Although most of the individual amounts paid were not disclosed, the total damages were recorded at £1,570,000.[49] Greenslade characterised Desmond as a ""rogue proprietor"".[49]
In late 2008, Express Newspapers began cutting 80 jobs to reduce costs by £2.5 million; however, too few staff were willing to take voluntary redundancy.[50][51] In early 2008, a previous cost-cutting exercise triggered the first 24-hour national press strike in the UK for 18 years.[52] In late August 2009 came plans for a further 70 redundancies, affecting journalists across Express Newspapers (including the Daily and Sunday Express, the Daily Star, and the Daily Star Sunday).[53]
In August 2009, the Advertising Standards Authority criticised the company for advertorials as features alongside adverts for the same products. The ASA noted that the pieces were ""always and uniquely favourable to the product featured in the ads and contained claims that have been or were likely to be prohibited in advertisements"".[54][55][56][57]
In January 2010, the Daily Express was censured by the Advertising Standards Authority over a front-page promotion for ""free"" fireworks. This led to comment that the Express has become ""the Ryanair of Fleet Street"", in that it is a ""frequent offender"" which pays little heed to the ASA's criticisms.[58]
In May 2010, Desmond announced a commitment of £100 million over five years to buy new equipment for the printing plants, beginning with the immediate purchase of four new presses, amid industry rumours that he was going to establish a printing plant at Luton.
On 31 December 2010, the Express, with all the media titles in Desmond's Northern & Shell group, were excluded from the Press Complaints Commission after withholding payment.[59] Lord Black, chairman of PressBof, the PCC's parent organisation, called this ""a deeply regrettable decision"".[59] According to Press Gazette, in December 2016 circulation figures showed gross sales of the Daily Mail were 1,491,264 compared to 391,626 for the Daily Express.[7]
The full run of the Daily Express has been digitised and is available at UK Press Online.[60]
In September 2017, Daily Mirror publisher Trinity Mirror announced its interest in buying all of Express Newspapers from Desmond. The Financial Times called it potentially the biggest change in the British newspaper industry for a decade.[61]
In February 2018, Trinity Mirror acquired the Daily Express, and other publishing assets of Northern & Shell, in a deal worth £126.7 million. To coincide with the purchase the Trinity Mirror group changed its name to Reach.[9][10] Hugh Whittow resigned as editor and Gary Jones took over as editor-in-chief soon after the purchase.[11]
The Daily Express endorsed Liz Truss in the July–September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election.[62]
In 2023, Reach launched a US version of the Express, called the-express.com. It is based in New York City.[63]
The printing press of the Sunday Express was first started by Lady Diana Manners on 29 December 1918.[64] It was edited by Michael Booker from 2018 to 2021 when he left for GB News. Its circulation in September 2025 was 93,754.[65]
Suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams was arrested in 1956, accused of murdering up to 400 wealthy patients in Eastbourne.[66] The press, ""egged on by police leaks, unanimously declared Adams guilty"", except for Percy Hoskins, chief crime reporter for the Express.[67] Hoskins was adamant that Adams was a naive doctor prosecuted by an overzealous detective, Herbert Hannam, whom Hoskins disliked from previous cases.[67] The Express, under Hoskins's direction, was the only major paper to defend Adams, causing Lord Beaverbrook to question Hoskins's stance.[67]
Adams was cleared in 1957 of the murder of Edith Alice Morrell (a second count was withdrawn controversially). After the case, Beaverbrook phoned Hoskins and said: ""Two people were acquitted today"", meaning Hoskins as well.[67] The Express carried an exclusive interview with Adams, whom Hoskins interviewed in a safe house away from other newspapers. According to archives released in 2003, Adams was thought by police to have killed 163 patients.[66]
On 8 March 2009, the Scottish edition of the Sunday Express published a front-page article critical of survivors of the 1996 Dunblane massacre, entitled ""Anniversary Shame of Dunblane Survivors"". The article criticised the 18-year-old survivors for posting ""shocking blogs and photographs of themselves on the internet"", revealing that they drank alcohol, made rude gestures and talked about their sex lives.[68] The article provoked complaints, leading to a front-page apology a fortnight later.[69] The Press Complaints Commission described the article as a ""serious error of judgement"" and said, ""Although the editor had taken steps to resolve the complaint, and rightly published an apology, the breach of the Code was so serious that no apology could remedy it"".[citation needed]
The Daily Express gained a reputation for printing conspiracy theories about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales as front-page news. The Independent and The Guardian in 2006 both published a selection of then recent Express headlines on the topic.[70][71] This practice was satirised in Private Eye as the Diana Express or the Di'ly Express, and has been attributed to Desmond's friendship with regular Eye target Mohamed Fayed.[note 1] The articles regularly quoted Fayed with the newspaper describing its campaign as ""Our relentless crusade for the truth"".[72] In 2006 and 2007, these front-page stories consistently appeared on Mondays, and ended only when the paper focused instead on the Madeleine McCann story (see below).
According to The Independent in 2006: ""The Diana stories appear on Mondays because Sunday is often a quiet day.""[73] In February and March 2010, the paper returned to featuring Diana stories on the front page on Mondays.[citation needed]
In September 2013, following an allegation raised by the estranged wife of an SAS operative, the Daily Express returned to running daily Princess Diana cover stories.[74][75][76][77][78]
In the second half of 2007 the Daily Express gave a large coverage to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. From 3 August 2007 to 10 November 2007, the Express dedicated at least part of the next 100 front pages to her. Of those, 82 used the headline to feature the details of the disappearance (often stylised by ""MADELEINE"" in red block capitals, plus a picture of the child).
Though the family initially said some journalists may have ""overstepped their mark"" they acknowledged the benefits in keeping the case in the public eye,[79] but said coverage needed to be toned down since daily headlines were not necessarily helpful.[80] In March 2008, the McCanns launched a libel suit against the Daily Express and the Daily Star, as well as their Sunday equivalents, following their coverage. The action concerned more than 100 stories across the four newspapers, which accused the McCanns of causing and covering up their daughter's death.[81] Express Newspapers pulled all references to Madeleine from its websites.[82]
In a settlement at the High Court of Justice, the newspapers ran a front-page apology to the McCanns on 19 March 2008, another apology on the front of the Sunday editions of 23 March and a statement of apology at the High Court. The newspapers also agreed to pay costs and damages, which the McCanns said they would use to fund the search for their daughter.[81] Guardian media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was ""unprecedented"" for four major newspapers to offer front-page apologies but also said it was more than warranted given that the papers had committed ""a substantial libel"" that shamed the British press.[83] Craig Silverman of Regret the Error,  a blog that reports media errors, argued that given how many of the stories appeared on the front page, anything less than a front-page apology would have been ""unacceptable"".[84]
In its apology, the Express said ""a number of articles in the newspaper have suggested that the couple caused the death of their missing daughter Madeleine and then covered it up. We acknowledge that there is no evidence whatsoever to support this theory and that Kate and Gerry are completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter's disappearance.""[85] This was followed in October by an apology and payout (forwarded to the fund again) to a group who had become known as the ""Tapas Seven"" in relation to the case.[86]
In 2013, the paper launched a ""crusade"" against new European Union rules on migrants from Bulgaria and Romania, inviting readers to sign a petition against lifting restrictions on immigration.[87][88] The front page on Thursday 31 October declared: ""Britain is full and fed up. Today join your Daily Express Crusade to stop new flood of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants"".[89] The Aberystwyth University Student Union announced a ban on the sale of the paper.[90] This ban was overturned in March 2016, following a student vote.[91] UKIP Leader Nigel Farage declared that he had signed the ""Crusade"" petition, and urged others to do the same.[92] Romanian politician Cătălin Ivan expressed ""outrage"" at the campaign.[93]
In a statement released by The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on 24 April 2015, the tabloid's name was mentioned in an accusation of producing hate speech, initially referring to an article in The Sun: ""...To give just one glimpse of the scale of the problem, back in 2003 the Daily Express ran 22 negative front pages stories about asylum seekers and refugees in a single 31-day period"" ... ""..the High Commissioner noted that Article 20 of the ICCPR, as well as elements relating to hate speech in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination* (both of which have been ratified by the UK, as well as by all other EU countries), were rooted in the desire to outlaw the type of anti-Semitic and other racially based hate speech used by the Nazi media during the 1930s"".[94]
Appearing in April 2018 before Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee, which was investigating the treatment of minority groups in print media, Daily Express editor Gary Jones said that he would be looking to change the tone of the paper. Jones said that he had found past pages of the newspaper ""downright offensive"", adding that they made him feel ""very uncomfortable"" and contributed to an ""Islamophobic sentiment"" in the media.[95]

Defunct
With the exception of the 2001 general election when it backed the Labour Party,[106] and the 2015 general election when it backed the UK Independence Party,[107][108] the newspaper has declared its support for the Conservative Party at every general election since World War II.[109] In 2011, when the newspaper first endorsed UKIP, it became one of the first media outlets in the United Kingdom to demand a withdrawal from the European Union.[110]
""Crusade for Freedom"" was the newspaper's own campaign to give the people of the United Kingdom the opportunity to add their names to a petition addressed to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in favour of Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. Each edition of the 8 January 2011 issue had four cut-out vouchers where readers could sign the pledge and send them to the paper's HQ where the petition was being compiled; there were also further editions with the same voucher included.[111] The campaign attracted the support of many celebrities including sportsman/TV personality Ian Botham[112] as well as J D Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin,[113] who both gave interviews for 8 January's special edition of the paper. The first week of the campaign saw a response of around 370,000 signatures being received (just over 50% of daily readership or around 0.6% of the UK population).

The Bill is a British police procedural television series, broadcast on ITV from 16 October 1984 until 31 August 2010. The programme originated from a one-off drama, ""Woodentop"" (part of the Storyboard series), broadcast on 16 August 1983. ITV were so impressed with the drama that a full series was commissioned. The title originates from ""Old Bill"", a slang term for the police and show creator Geoff McQueen's original title for the series.
The Bill focuses on the lives and work of one shift of police officers of all ranks, and the storylines deal with situations faced by uniformed officers working on the beat, as well as plainclothes detectives. Producers initially wanted to replicate the ""day in the life"" feature of Woodentop, and made sure a police officer was featured in every single scene. The series later adopted a much more serialised approach, and a revamp in 2002 led to more of a soap-opera feel to many of its stories. The Bill began with a regular cast of 13 members, with only two of these being uniformed women. In total, 174 actors have formed part of the series' main cast.
Throughout its 26-year run, the programme was always broadcast on the main ITV channel. In later years, episodes of the show were repeated on ITV3 on their week of broadcast. The series has also been repeated on other digital stations, including UKTV Gold and Drama. It has been broadcast in over 55 countries. The series has attracted controversy on several occasions. An episode broadcast in 2008 was criticised for featuring fictional treatment for multiple sclerosis. The series also faced more general criticism concerning its levels of violence, particularly prior to 2009, when it occupied a pre-watershed slot. The Bill, its cast and crew have won and been nominated for a number of awards, including BAFTAs and a Writers' Guild of Great Britain Award.
In March 2010, following a spell of declining viewership and negative public and media reception, executives at ITV announced that the network did not intend to recommission The Bill and that filming would cease on 14 June 2010. The final episode, titled ""Respect"", aired on 31 August 2010. The Bill was the longest-running police procedural television series in the United Kingdom, and among the longest running of any British television series at the time of its cancellation.
The Bill was originally conceived in 1983 by Geoff McQueen, then a new television writer, as a one-off drama. McQueen had originally titled the production Old Bill.[2] It was picked up by Michael Chapman for ITV franchise holder Thames Television, who retitled it Woodentop as part of Thames's Storyboard series of one-off dramas and broadcast on ITV under the title Woodentop on 16 August 1983.[2] Woodentop starred Mark Wingett as PC Jim Carver and Trudie Goodwin as WPC June Ackland of London's Metropolitan Police, both attached to the fictional Sun Hill police station.[2]
Although originally only intended as a one-off, Woodentop so impressed ITV that a full series was commissioned, first broadcast on 16 October 1984 with one post-watershed episode per week, featuring an hour-long, separate storyline for each episode of the first three series. The first episode of the full series was ""Funny Ol' Business – Cops & Robbers"". With serialisation, the name of the show changed from Woodentop to The Bill.[2] Series one had 11 episodes and was broadcast in 1984, series two and three had 12 episodes each and were broadcast in 1985–1986 and 1987 respectively.[3] With a full ensemble cast to explore new characters not featured or just mentioned in Woodentop, the focus of the storylines soon shifted away from new recruit Carver and towards Detective Inspector Roy Galloway (John Salthouse) and Sergeant Bob Cryer (Eric Richard).[4]
The series then changed to two 30-minute episodes per week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays in 1988 (from July 1988 onwards, and began being broadcast all year round without a summer break),[5] increasing to three a week beginning in 1993, with the third episode being broadcast on Fridays. In 1998, The Bill returned to hour-long episodes, which later became twice-weekly,[6] with the Friday episode being dropped, at which point the series adopted a much more serialised approach. When Paul Marquess took over as executive producer in 2002, as part of a drive for ratings,[7] the series was revamped, bringing more of a soap-opera feel to many of its stories. Many veteran characters were written out, leading to the Sun Hill fire during 2002. Marquess stated that the clearout was necessary to introduce ""plausible, powerful new characters"". As part of the new serial format, much more of the characters' personal lives were explored but, as Marquess put it, the viewers still ""don't go home with them"".[2] The change also allowed The Bill to become more reflective of modern policing, with the introduction of officers from ethnic minorities, most notably the new superintendent, Adam Okaro (Cyril Nri). It also allowed coverage of the relationship of gay Sergeant Craig Gilmore (Hywel Simons) and PC Luke Ashton (Scott Neal), a storyline which Marquess was determined to explore before rival Merseybeat.[2]
In 2005, Johnathan Young took over as executive producer.[2] The serial format was dropped and The Bill returned to stand-alone episodes with more focus on crime and policing than on the officers' personal lives. The year 2007 saw the reintroduction of episode titles, which had been dropped in 2002.[7] In 2009, The Bill moved back to the 9 pm slot it previously held, and the theme tune, ""Overkill"", was replaced as part of a major overhaul of the series.[7][8]
On 26 March 2010, ITV announced that it would be cancelling the series later that year after 27 years on air in 26 series.[9][10] ITV said that this decision reflected the ""changing tastes"" of viewers.[11] The last episode of The Bill was filmed in June 2010 and broadcast on 31 August 2010[12] followed by a documentary titled Farewell The Bill.[13] Fans of the show started a Save The Bill campaign on Facebook to persuade ITV to reconsider the cancellation,[14] and BBC Radio 1's Chris Moyles promoted the campaign on air.[15]
At the time the series ended in August 2010, The Bill was the United Kingdom's longest-running police drama and was among the longest-running of any British television series.[16] The series finale, ""Respect"", was aired in two parts and was dedicated to ""the men and women of the Metropolitan Police Service past and present"".[17] The finale storyline concerned gang member Jasmine Harris being involved in the murder of fellow member Liam Martin who died in the arms of Inspector Smith (Alex Walkinshaw) after being stabbed. Jasmine is then gang raped because she talked to the police, and when Callum Stone (Sam Callis) found the person responsible he was held at gunpoint. Of the finale's title, executive producer Jonathan Young said ""It's called ""Respect"" and we hope it will respect the heritage of the show"". The finale episodes featured all the cast and the final scene was specially written so all cast members would be featured. The final character on screen was Superintendent Jack Meadows (Simon Rouse), by then the show's longest serving character, having first appeared in 1990; he is shown exiting the front door, getting in his car and driving off. Following the final episode, ITV aired a documentary entitled Farewell The Bill which featured interviews from past and present cast and crew members.[18] The finale was watched by 4.4 million viewers, with Farewell The Bill averaging 1.661 million viewers.[19]
On 17 April 2021, various media outlets began reporting that the series may be set for a reboot. Writer Simon Sansome was understood to have bought the rights to the original series, and was planning a revival, dubbed Sun Hill (as licensing meant the series could no longer be called The Bill), alongside Holby City creator and former EastEnders writer Tony McHale who had previously written episodes of The Bill and one of its spin-offs, Beech is Back. Sansome had been in talks with various cast members during a 2020 reunion and discussed possible appearances for show legends Mark Wingett (Jim Carver), Trudie Goodwin (June Ackland) and Graham Cole (Tony Stamp). However, no official date had been set for a return, nor had the mooted Sun Hill project been picked up by any TV network.[20] On 18 April, Mark Wingett confirmed this on his Twitter account, stating they had been ""approached"" by production companies but the Sun Hill project had not been given the green light.[21]
Throughout the series, there have been three filming locations for Sun Hill police station. From the first series, the police station consisted of a set of buildings in Artichoke Hill, Wapping, East London.[22] However, these buildings were next to the News International plant and during the winter of 1985–86 there was much industrial action which resulted in some altercations between the strikers and actors working on The Bill who were mistaken for real officers. Working conditions got so dire that the production team realised they needed to find another base to set Sun Hill police station.[23]
The second location was an old record distribution depot in Barlby Road, North Kensington in North West London.[22] Filming began here in March 1987. In 1989, the owners of the Barlby Road site ordered The Bill out, due to their redevelopment plans for the area. After an extensive search, two sites were selected, the favourite being a disused hospital in Clapham. However, this fell through and the second option was chosen—an old wine distribution warehouse in Merton, South West London. The move was made in March 1990 and was disguised on screen by the ""ongoing"" refurbishment of Sun Hill police station and then finally the explosion of a terrorist car-bomb in the station car-park, which ended up killing PC Ken Melvin.[24]
Filming for the series took place all over London, mainly in South London and particularly the London Borough of Merton, where the Sun Hill set was located.[2] Locations used when the show was filmed on a housing estate included:
Scenes were often filmed in east London, most notably the London Docklands,[29] with other scenes filmed in Tooting,[30] Greenwich[31] and Croydon.[32] In 2008, the episode ""Demolition Girl"" was filmed in The Gorbals, Glasgow.[33]
The set of Sun Hill police station at Wimbledon Studios remained until mid 2013 when it was finally dismantled.[34]
The Bill is set in and around Sun Hill police station, in the fictional ""Canley Borough Operational Command Unit"" in East London. Geoff McQueen, creator of The Bill, claimed that he named Sun Hill after a street name in his home town of Royston, Hertfordshire.[2]
The fictional Sun Hill suburb is located in the fictional London borough of Canley in the East End, north of the River Thames (Canley is the name of a real suburb of Coventry). The Borough of Canley is approximately contiguous to the real-life London Borough of Tower Hamlets,[35] and in the first few years of The Bill, Sun Hill police station was actually stated as being located in Wapping in Tower Hamlets. Sun Hill has a London E1 postcode (the 'address' of Sun Hill police station is given as '2 Sun Hill Road, Sun Hill, Canley E1 4KM [36]), which corresponds to the real-life areas of Whitechapel and Stepney.
When filming The Bill, some outdoor scenes were re-enacted indoors with microphones surrounding the actors and the extra sounds being ""dubbed"" on later.  Some of the more aggressive scenes were also filmed indoors either for dubbing or safety reasons.[37] The sirens used in the series were added later in the dubbing suite as The Bill did not have permission to use them while on location. However,[38] the police uniforms used in the series were genuine, again making The Bill unique amongst police dramas.[2][39][40] When the series ended, London's Metropolitan Police Service, after talks with the production company, bought 400 kilograms of police-related paraphernalia, including uniforms and body armour, to prevent them falling into the hands of criminals after the programme's production ceased.[41] The Bill is unique amongst police dramas in that it takes a serial format, focusing on the work and lives of a single shift of police officers, rather than on one particular area of police work. Also unique is that The Bill adapted to this format after several series, whereas comparable series started with the serial format.[42]
During its initial broadcast, The Bill was always shown on ITV. In 2009, STV, ITV's regional franchise in Central and Northern Scotland, opted out of broadcasting the series along with a number of other dramas, a decision that later became the subject of legal proceedings between STV and the main ITV network. The legal dispute was settled on 27 April 2011, with ITV receiving £18 million from STV.[43]
Aside from repeats of episodes on ITV3, which occurred on the original week of their broadcast, the show has regularly been repeated on other digital stations. Re-runs of the series began on 1 November 1992, when new digital channel UKTV Gold began broadcasting. The channel broadcast repeats of the series for nearly 16 years, until 6 October 2008, when the channel was given a revamp by the owners of the network. During the 16-year period, re-runs of the series covered every episode broadcast between 16 October 1984, and 8 March 2007.[44] Episodes have also been broadcast on British drama channel Alibi until 23 December 2009. On 27 January 2010, UKTV relocated The Bill to its entertainment channel Watch. In July 2013, the show began broadcasting on Drama, starting with episodes from 1998.[45] Drama planned to air every episode from the beginning in 2017, but after a few weeks, the channel jumped to series 14.[46] Every series of The Bill was later added to the video-on-demand platform UKTV Play in 2024.[47]
The Bill has been broadcast in over 55 countries.[2][48]
The first opening sequence of The Bill was featured in the first episode ""Funny Ol' Business – Cops & Robbers"". The sequence consisted of two police officers, one male and one female, walking down a street while images of Sun Hill were interspersed between them. The theme tune is called ""Overkill"" and was composed by Charlie Morgan and Andy Pask.[54] The theme is notable for its use of septuple meter. It also features a guitar riff, with synthesizer, bass and drum accompaniment, with ""middle-eight"" sections performed on synthesizers. From the fourth series a melody line was added to the ""Overkill"" theme, also composed by Pask and Morgan.[55] The end titles of the series simply showed the feet of the two police constables pounding the beat.[56] On 6 January 1998, starting with ""Hard Cash"", the third episode of the show's 14th series, a new version of the theme and title sequence debuted.[57]
On 20 February 2001, starting with ""Going Under"", the 14th episode of the show's 17th series, the previous opening and closing sequences were scrapped to make way for a completely new sequence and theme. This time, the opening sequence consisted of a montage image of the entire cast, backed by a darker, slower version of ""Overkill"". Vicky Frost of The Guardian was critical of the titles, writing ""I remain to be convinced about these opening titles from 2001, with their jazzed-up theme tune, and shards of faces.""[58] On 26 February 2003, starting with Episode No. 091, the opening and closing sequences were once again updated. This time, the opening sequence consisted of several generic police images, such as a police car and uniform. A new arrangement of ""Overkill"", composed by Lawrence Oakley, was also used for both the opening and closing sequences.[59]
On 3 January 2007, the opening and closing sequences were once again changed. This time, the opening sequence, for the first time, features an image of the Sun Hill sign, and returns to featuring images of officers in action.[58] This sequence also featured a further new arrangement of ""Overkill"", once again arranged by Lawrence Oakley.[59] On 23 July 2009, after the programme underwent a major overhaul, the opening sequence and theme tune were heavily changed.[8] This time, the classic ""Overkill"" theme was completely removed, and a new theme created by Simba Studios was used. However, producer Jonathan Young stated that echoes of ""Overkill"" can still be heard in the theme.[60][61] The opening sequence featured a patrol car driving through the streets of Sun Hill.[62]
When The Bill was first commissioned as a series by ITV, it started with 12 episodes per year, each an hour long with a separate storyline.[2] In 1988, the format changed to a year-round broadcast with two 30-minute episodes per week. In 1993, this expanded to three 30-minute episodes per week. In 1998, the broadcast format changed to two one-hour episodes each week, also recording in 16:9 widescreen Digibeta. In 2009, The Bill began broadcasting in HD and as part of a major revamp, was reduced to broadcasting once a week.[63] The Bill ceased broadcasting on 31 August 2010 after 2,425 episodes, due to a decline in ratings.[64]
In 2000, ITV broadcast a one-off episode called ""The Trial of Eddie Santini"" which concluded a long-running storyline between PC Eddie Santini (Michael Higgs) and WPC Rosie Fox (Caroline Catz).[65] The following year, another one-off episode called ""Beech on the Run"" was filmed and set in Australia. It follows Claire Stanton's (Clara Salaman) pursuit of DS Don Beech (Billy Murray), who is wanted for the murder of DS John Boulton (Russell Boulter).[66] Further episodes filmed overseas include 1999's ""Foreign Body"", which was filmed in France,[67] and the two-part crossover episode ""Proof of Life"" with the German series Leipzig Homicide, which was filmed in Germany and broadcast in November 2008.[68]
The Bill has broadcast two live episodes. The first ""Fatal Consequences"" aired on 30 October 2003 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the pilot, Woodentop.[69] The episode was produced with a crew of 200 staff including seven camera crews.[6][69] It was reported to be the first live television broadcast of a programme where filming was not largely confined to a studio.[69] The storyline centres on Detective Constable Juliet Becker (Rae Baker) and Constable Cathy Bradford (Connie Hyde) who are being held hostage by a man called Mark (Charles Dale) in a van in the station yard.[70] The episode was watched by around 10 million viewers.[71] ""Fatal Consequences"" was released onto DVD in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2011, as part of Network DVD's ""Soap Box: Volume 1"".[72]
The second live episode ""Confessions of a Killer"" aired on 22 September 2005 to celebrate the 50th birthday of ITV.[71] The episode features the departures of three officers, as a fire engulfs Sun Hill.[73] The episode attracted over nine million viewers, and was only the second time Computer-generated imagery had been used on the show, as creating a real fireball ripping through the station corridors was not possible.[73]
A series of episodes titled The Bill Uncovered were produced to reflect the stories of select characters and events. The first was The Bill Uncovered : Des and Reg (2004) – The story of the unusual friendship between PC Des Taviner (Paul Usher) and PC Reg Hollis (Jeff Stewart), traversing their history from Des's first day at Sun Hill to his death in a Sun Hill cell.[74]
The second was The Bill Uncovered: Kerry's Story (2004), the story of PC Kerry Young (Beth Cordingly), who met her death outside Sun Hill.[75] The third special was The Bill Uncovered : Jim's Story (2005), the story of DC Jim Carver (Mark Wingett) – from his first day at Sun Hill (in the pilot ""Woodentop""). The last was The Bill Uncovered: On The Front Line (2006), in which Superintendent Adam Okaro (Cyril Nri) recounts the extraordinary events that have surrounded Sun Hill over his time in charge.[76] A review of the second of these specials criticised the ""increasingly degenerative plotlines"" of the series, and characterised the special as a ""cheerless outing"" covering The Bill's ""travesties of plot"".[75] All four editions of The Bill Uncovered were released on DVD in Australia as part of The Bill Series 26 DVD boxset on 30 April 2014.[77]
To celebrate the show's 25th anniversary, a special programme The Bill Made Me Famous was broadcast in November 2008. Narrated by Martin Kemp, it features former actors and special guest stars discussing their time working on the show and how it changed their lives, including Paul O'Grady, Les Dennis, Michelle Collins, Pauline Quirke and Darren Day.[78]
Immediately following the final episode, a one-hour special titled Farewell The Bill was broadcast on 31 August 2010.[79] The special explored the history of the series and gave viewers a behind the scenes look at the filming of the last episode.[79] This special was later released on DVD in Australia on 5 October 2011, along with the last two-part episode ""Respect"".[80]
The Bill had a large regular cast to support the number of episodes that were produced each year. Working on The Bill became something of a rite of passage in British acting, with 174 actors having formed part of the series' main cast since the series began.[46] The constant need for minor characters, normally appearing in only a single episode, inevitably led to numerous guest roles in The Bill being played by actors and actresses who later achieved a high profile, some of whom appeared as child actors. These include Keira Knightley, James McAvoy, Ray Winstone and Sean Bean.[81]
The original one-off episode Woodentop followed a day in the life of PC Jim Carver (Mark Wingett). It also featured WPC June Ackland (Trudie Goodwin).[46] When a full series of The Bill was commissioned, producers wanted to replicate the ""Day in the Life"" feature and made sure a police officer was in every single scene.[46] When the series began there were 13 regular cast members. Only two of these were uniformed women – WPCs June Ackland and Viv Martella (Nula Conwell). There were no female characters in the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).[82] The show's first black police officer PC Abel Lyttleton (Ronny Cush) was introduced in 1985.[3] In 2002, new executive producer Paul Marquess introduced a ""serialised, almost soap-opera style"" with episodes focusing more on the officers' personal lives.[46] Marquess also wrote out a number of characters during a fire in the station. He then introduced several new characters to the show, including PC Kerry Young (Beth Cordingly), Inspector Gina Gold (Roberta Taylor), and Ken Drummond (Russell Floyd).[83] The longest serving cast members were Trudie Goodwin and Jeff Stewart (PC Reg Hollis), who starred in over 900 episodes, and Graham Cole (PC Tony Stamp) who starred in 1,112 episodes.[46]
The following list contains characters whose roles transformed the series, and in some cases led to spin-offs, as well as characters who hold individual accolades for their time on the series.
The Bill was a popular drama in the United Kingdom and in many other countries, most notably in Australia.[42]
The series attracted audiences of up to six million viewers in 2008 and 2009.[100] Ratings during 2002 peaked after the overhaul of the show which brought about the 2002 fire episode, in which six officers were killed,[101] and the 2003 live episode attracted 10 million viewers – 40% of the UK audience share.[102] Immediately following The Bill's revamping and time slot change, it was reported that the programme had attracted 4.5 million viewers, 19% of the audience share, but it lost out in the ratings to the BBC's New Tricks,[103] with the Daily Mirror later reporting that ITV's schedule change was behind a two million viewer drop in ratings.[104]
In 2001, prior to Paul Marquess's appointment as executive producer, ratings had dropped to approximately six million viewers, and advertising revenues had fallen, in part due to the ageing demographic of its viewers, leading ITV to order a ""rejuvenation"", which saw the series adopt a serial format.[2]
In 2002, The Independent reported that The Bill's Thursday episode was viewed by approximately 7 million people, a fall of approximately 3 million viewers in the space of six months.[105] After the cast clearout resulting from the Sun Hill fire in April 2002, BBC News reported that the show attracted 8.6 million viewers, the highest figure for the year to that point,[101] and by October 2003, the program had around 8 million viewers each week.[6]
In 2005, The Bill was averaging around 11 million viewers, in comparison to Coronation Street, which was attracting around 10 million viewers.[106]
In 2009, The Daily Mirror reported that The Bill was to be moved to a post-watershed slot to allow it to cover grittier storylines. It was reported that it was the first time in British Television that ITV had broadcast a drama all year in the 9 pm slot.[107] The changeover happened at the end of July 2009.  Before the move, the programme was averaging 5 million viewers between the two episodes each week. BARB reported that the week of 12–18 October 2009 saw 3.78 million viewers watch the show.[108]
The Bill has achieved a number of awards throughout its time on air, ranging from a BAFTA[109] to the Royal Television Society Awards.[110] and the Inside Soap Awards, particularly the Best Recurring Drama category.[111][112]
In 2010, The Bill was nominated for a Royal Television Society award for Best Soap/Continuing Drama, beating both Coronation Street and Emmerdale onto the nominations list. The only soap to be nominated was EastEnders and the results were announced on 16 March 2010.[113] In 2009 an episode of The Bill won the Knights of Illumination Award for Lighting Design- Drama.[114]
It has been compared to Hill Street Blues due to the similar, serial, format that both series take.[115] However, The Bill saw little direct competition on British television in the police procedural genre over its 25-year history, though the BBC launched several rival series, with varying degrees of success: The first was in 1990–91 when two series of Waterfront Beat were produced for the BBC by Phil Redmond.[116] In 1995–96, two series of Out of the Blue were produced, but failed to gain significant ratings.[117] In 1998 came City Central, which lasted for three series, until being cancelled in 2000.[118][119] Next was  Merseybeat, which began airing in 2001, but was cancelled in 2004 due to poor ratings and problems with the cast.[120][121] HolbyBlue, launched in 2007, was a spin-off of successful medical drama Holby City (itself a spin-off of the long-running Casualty). It was scheduled to go ""head to head"" with The Bill, prompting a brief ""ratings war"" but, in 2008, HolbyBlue was also cancelled by the BBC, again, largely due to poor ratings.[122][123]
When The Bill started, the majority of the Police Federation were opposed to the programme, claiming that it portrayed the police as a racist organisation, but feelings towards the programme later mellowed,[40] to the extent that, in 2006, executive producer Johnathan Young met Sir Ian Blair, then Commissioner of the Met, and it was decided that the editorial relationship between the police and the programme was sufficient. However, Young stressed that The Bill was not ""editorially bound"" to the police.[40]
Despite better relations with the police, The Bill was still not without controversy.  It was sometimes criticised for the high levels of violence, especially prior to 2009, when it occupied a pre-watershed timeslot.[56] Specific story lines also came under fire in the media, such as that involving a gay kiss in 2002,[2] as well as an episode broadcast in March 2008 which featured a fictional treatment for multiple sclerosis, leading the MS Society to brand the plot ""grossly irresponsible"".[124]
The Bill spawned several spin-off productions, as well as related series in German and Dutch.
Starting in 1985, author John Burke wrote a series of novelisations of select episodes.[131]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Comedy_of_Errors,The Comedy of Errors,"
The Comedy of Errors is one of William Shakespeare's earliest plays. It is his shortest and one of his most farcical comedies, with a major part of the humour coming from slapstick and mistaken identity, in addition to puns and word play. It has been adapted for opera, stage, screen and musical theatre numerous times worldwide. In the centuries following its premiere, the play's title has entered the popular English lexicon as an idiom for ""an event or series of events made ridiculous by the number of errors that were made throughout"".[1]
Set in the Greek city of Ephesus, The Comedy of Errors tells the story of two sets of identical twins who were accidentally separated at birth. Antipholus of Syracuse and his servant, Dromio of Syracuse, arrive in Ephesus, which turns out to be the home of their twin brothers, Antipholus of Ephesus and his servant, Dromio of Ephesus. When the Syracusans encounter the friends and families of their twins, a series of wild mishaps based on mistaken identities lead to wrongful beatings, a near-seduction, the arrest of Antipholus of Ephesus, and false accusations of infidelity, theft, madness, and demonic possession.
Because a law forbids merchants from Syracuse from entering Ephesus, elderly Syracusan trader Aegeon faces execution when he is discovered in the city. He can only escape by paying a fine of a thousand marks. He tells his sad story to Solinus, Duke of Ephesus. In his youth, Aegeon married and had twin sons. On the same day, a poor woman without a job also gave birth to twin boys, and he purchased these as servants to his sons. Soon afterward, the family made a sea voyage and was hit by a tempest. Aegeon lashed himself to the main-mast with one son and one servant, and his wife took the other two infants. His wife was rescued by one boat, Aegeon by another. Aegeon never again saw his wife or the children with her. Recently his son Antipholus, now grown, and his son's servant, Dromio, left Syracuse to find their brothers. When Antipholus did not return, Aegeon set out in search of him. The Duke is moved by this story and grants Aegeon one day to pay his fine.
That same day, Antipholus arrives in Ephesus, searching for his brother. He sends Dromio to deposit some money at The Centaur, an inn. He is confounded when the identical Dromio of Ephesus appears almost immediately, denying any knowledge of the money and asking him home to dinner, where his wife is waiting. Antipholus, thinking his servant is making insubordinate jokes, beats Dromio of Ephesus.
Dromio of Ephesus returns to his mistress, Adriana, saying that her ""husband"" refused to come back to his house, and even pretended not to know her. Adriana, concerned that her husband's eye is straying, takes this news as confirmation of her suspicions.
Antipholus of Syracuse, who complains ""I could not speak with Dromio since at first, I sent him from the mart,"" meets up with Dromio of Syracuse who now denies making a ""joke"" about Antipholus having a wife. Antipholus begins beating him. Suddenly, Adriana rushes up to Antipholus of Syracuse and begs him not to leave her. The Syracusans cannot but attribute these strange events to witchcraft, remarking that Ephesus is known as a warren for witches. Antipholus and Dromio go off with this strange woman, the one to eat dinner and the other to keep the gate.
Inside the house, Antipholus of Syracuse discovers that he is very attracted to his ""wife's"" sister, Luciana, telling her ""train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note / To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears."" She is flattered by his attention but worried about their moral implications. After she exits, Dromio of Syracuse announces that he has discovered that he has a wife: Nell, a hideous kitchen-maid. The Syracusans decide to leave as soon as possible, and Dromio runs off to make travel plans. Antipholus of Syracuse is then confronted by Angelo of Ephesus, a goldsmith, who claims that Antipholus ordered a chain from him. Antipholus is forced to accept the chain, and Angelo says that he will return for payment.
Antipholus of Ephesus returns home for dinner and is enraged to find that he is rudely refused entry to his own house by Dromio of Syracuse, who is keeping the gate. He is ready to break down the door, but his friends persuade him not to make a scene. He decides, instead, to dine with a courtesan.
Antipholus of Ephesus dispatches Dromio of Ephesus to purchase a rope so that he can beat his wife Adriana for locking him out, then is accosted by Angelo, who tells him ""I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine"" and asks to be reimbursed for the chain. He denies ever seeing it and is promptly arrested. As he is being led away, Dromio of Syracuse arrives, whereupon Antipholus dispatches him back to Adriana's house to get money for his bail. After completing this errand, Dromio of Syracuse mistakenly delivers the money to Antipholus of Syracuse. The Courtesan spies Antipholus wearing the gold chain, and says he promised it to her in exchange for her ring. The Syracusans deny this and flee. The Courtesan resolves to tell Adriana that her husband is insane. Dromio of Ephesus returns to the arrested Antipholus of Ephesus, with the rope. Antipholus is infuriated. Adriana, Luciana, and the Courtesan enter with a conjurer named Pinch, who tries to exorcize the Ephesians, who are bound and taken to Adriana's house. The Syracusans enter, carrying swords, and everybody runs off for fear: believing that they are the Ephesians, out for vengeance after somehow escaping their bonds. 
Adriana reappears with henchmen, who attempt to bind the Syracusans. They take sanctuary in a nearby priory, where the Abbess resolutely protects them. Suddenly, the Abbess enters with the Syracusan twins, and everyone begins to understand the confused events of the day. Not only are the two sets of twins reunited, but the Abbess reveals that she is Aegeon's wife, Emilia. The Duke pardons Aegeon. All exit into the abbey to celebrate the reunification of the family.
The play is a modernised adaptation of Menaechmi by Plautus. As William Warner's translation of the classical drama was entered into the Register of the Stationers Company on 10 June 1594, published in 1595, and dedicated to Lord Hunsdon, the patron of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, it has been supposed that Shakespeare might have seen the translation in manuscript before it was printed – though it is equally possible that he knew the play in the original Latin.
The play contains a topical reference to the wars of succession in France, which would fit any date from 1589 to 1595. Charles Whitworth argues that The Comedy of Errors was written ""in the latter part of 1594"" on the basis of historical records and textual similarities with other plays Shakespeare wrote around this time.[2] The play was not published until it appeared in the First Folio in 1623.
For centuries, scholars have found little thematic depth in The Comedy of Errors. Harold Bloom, however, wrote that it ""reveals Shakespeare's magnificence at the art of comedy"",[3] and praised the work as showing ""such skill, indeed mastery – in action, incipient character, and stagecraft – that it far outshines the three Henry VI plays and the rather lame comedy The Two Gentlemen of Verona"".[4] Stanley Wells also referred to it as the first Shakespeare play ""in which mastery of craft is displayed"".[5] The play was not a particular favourite on the eighteenth-century stage because it failed to offer the kind of striking roles that actors such as David Garrick could exploit.
The play was particularly notable in one respect. In the earlier eighteenth century, some critics followed the French critical standard of judging the quality of a play by its adherence to the classical unities, as specified by Aristotle in the fourth century BC. The Comedy of Errors and The Tempest were the only two of Shakespeare's plays to comply with this standard.[6]
Law professor Eric Heinze, however, argues that particularly notable in the play is a series of social relationships, which is in crisis as it sheds its feudal forms and confronts the market forces of early modern Europe.[7]
Two early performances of The Comedy of Errors are recorded. One, by ""a company of base and common fellows"", is mentioned in the Gesta Grayorum (""The Deeds of Gray"") as having occurred in Gray's Inn Hall on 28 December 1594 during the inn's revels. The second also took place on ""Innocents' Day"", but ten years later: 28 December 1604, at Court.[8]
Like many of Shakespeare's plays, The Comedy of Errors was adapted and rewritten extensively, particularly from the 18th century on, with varying reception from audiences.
The play has been adapted as a musical several times, frequently by inserting period music into the light comedy.  Some musical adaptations include a Victorian musical comedy (Arts Theatre, Cambridge, England, 1951), Brechtian folk opera (Arts Theatre, London, 1956), and a two-ring circus (Delacorte Theater, New York, 1967).
Fully original musical adaptations include:
In India, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar adapted Shakespeare's play in his Bengali novel Bhranti Bilash (1869). Vidyasagar's efforts were part of the process of championing Shakespeare and the Romantics during the Bengal Renaissance.[33][34]
The film Our Relations (1936) starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, was adapted from the W. W. Jacobs story ""The Money Box"", but there are no twins in the Jacobs story. Our Relations owes its central conceit to The Comedy of Errors.[original research?] As in the Shakespeare play, the story revolves around the confusion of two pairs of identical twins: one set of Laurel brothers named ""Stan"" and ""Alf"", and one set of Hardy brothers named ""Oliver"" and ""Bert"". Stan and Oliver think Alf and Bert were killed at sea. As the story opens, Alf and Bert have just arrived via ship at the same seaport where, unbeknownst to them, their married twin brothers Stan and Oliver live.[citation needed] One nod to the movie's inspiration is a running gag: whenever Stan and Ollie say the same thing at the same time, they immediately perform a childhood ritual that begins: ""Shakespeare...Longfellow...""[original research?]
The Three Stooges film A Merry Mix Up (1957) starring Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Joe Besser expands the confusion by telling the story of three sets of identical triplets: Bachelors Moe, Larry and Joe; husbands Max, Louie and Jack; and newly-engaged brothers Morris, Luke and Jeff. The triplets can only be distinguished by their choices of neckties, bow ties, or no tie at all.[citation needed]
The film Start the Revolution Without Me (1970) starring Gene Wilder and Donald Sutherland involves two pairs of twins, one of each of which is switched at birth; one set is raised in an aristocratic, the other in a peasant family, who meet during the French Revolution.
The film Big Business (1988) is a modern take on The Comedy of Errors, with female twins instead of male. Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin star in the film as two sets of twins separated at birth, much like the characters in Shakespeare's play.
The short film The Complete Walk: The Comedy of Errors was made in 2016 and starred Phil Davis, Omid Djalili and Boothby Graffoe.
Indian cinema has made nine films based on the play:

David John Tennant (né McDonald; born 18 April 1971) is a Scottish actor. He is best known for portraying the tenth and fourteenth incarnations of the Doctor in the science fiction series Doctor Who (2005–2010, 2013, 2023). His other notable screen roles include portraying Barty Crouch Jr. in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), DI Alec Hardy in the British crime drama series Broadchurch (2013–2017) and its American remake Gracepoint, Kilgrave in the superhero series Jessica Jones (2015–2019), Crowley in the fantasy series Good Omens (2019–present) and various fictionalised versions of himself in the comedy series Staged (2020–2022).
Tennant has worked extensively on stage, including a portrayal of the title character in a 2008 Royal Shakespeare Company production of Hamlet that was later adapted for television. He is also a voice actor, featuring in the animated series DuckTales (2017–2021) as the voice of Scrooge McDuck. In 2015, he was the recipient of the Special Recognition Award at the National Television Award.
Tennant was born David John McDonald[1] in Bathgate on 18 April 1971,[2] the son of Helen (née McLeod) and Alexander ""Sandy"" McDonald.[3] His father was a minister who served as the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.[4][5] He grew up with his brother Blair and sister Karen in Ralston,[6] where his father was the local minister.[7][1] Two of his maternal great-grandparents, William and Agnes Blair, were Ulster Protestants from Derry who were among the signatories of the Ulster Covenant in 1912; William was also a member of the Orange Order. Tennant's maternal grandfather, footballer Archie McLeod, met William and Agnes' daughter Nellie while playing for Derry City FC. McLeod was descended from tenant farmers from the Isle of Mull.[8][9] Tennant was born with an extra toe on his right foot;[10] he has also suffered from anxiety since childhood.[11]
At the age of three, Tennant told his parents that he wanted to become an actor because he was a fan of Doctor Who,[12] but they encouraged him to aim for more conventional work.[6] He later said that he was ""absurdly single-minded"" in pursuing an acting career. He watched almost every Doctor Who episode for years and once spoke to Fourth Doctor actor Tom Baker at a book-signing event in Glasgow.[6] He was educated at Ralston Primary School and Paisley Grammar School; he acted in various school productions.[13] His talent was noticed by actress Edith MacArthur, who told his parents that she believed he would become a successful theatre actor after she saw him perform when he was 10 years old.[14]
Tennant attended Saturday classes at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland before passing an official audition at the age of 16, becoming one of their youngest students and studying there between the ages of 17 and 20.[13] In 1991, Tennant obtained here a BA degree in Dramatic Studies.[15]
After discovering that there was another David McDonald already represented by the actor's union Equity, he created his stage name by adopting the surname of Pet Shop Boys frontman Neil Tennant, whom he had seen in Smash Hits.[16][17] He later legally changed his surname to comply with rules set by the American Screen Actors Guild (which was later merged into SAG-AFTRA).[18]
Tennant made his professional acting debut while still in secondary school. When he was 16, he acted in an anti-smoking film made by the Glasgow Health Board which was shown on television and was also screened in schools.[14] The following year, he played a role in an episode of Dramarama. Tennant's first professional role upon graduating from drama school was in a staging of The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui co-starring Ashley Jensen, one of a few plays in which he performed as part of the agitprop 7:84 Theatre Company.[13] He also made an early television appearance in the Scottish TV sitcom Rab C Nesbitt as a transgender barmaid called Davina. In the 1990s, he appeared in several plays at the Dundee Repertory Theatre.[19]
Tennant was awarded his first major TV role as Campbell Bain in the BBC Scotland drama series Takin' Over the Asylum (1994), after impressing director David Blair during filming of another drama – Strathblair (1992). As Tennant recalled from the audition, ""they needed someone who could believably act 19 and bonkers"".[20] During filming of Takin' Over the Asylum he met comic actress and writer Arabella Weir. When he moved to London shortly afterwards, he lodged with Weir for five years[13] and became godfather to her youngest child. He has subsequently appeared with Weir in many productions: as a guest in her spoof television series Posh Nosh, in the Doctor Who audio drama Exile (during which Weir played an alternative version of the Doctor), and as panellists on the West Wing Ultimate Quiz on More4 (Weir later guest-starred on Doctor Who itself after Tennant left the series). One of his earliest big-screen roles was in Jude (1996).
Tennant developed his career in the British theatre, frequently performing with the Royal Shakespeare Company. His first Shakespearean role for the RSC was in As You Like It (1996); having auditioned for the role of Orlando, the romantic lead, he was instead cast as the jester Touchstone.[21] He subsequently specialised in comic roles, playing Antipholus of Syracuse in The Comedy of Errors and Captain Jack Absolute in The Rivals, although he also played the role of Romeo in Romeo and Juliet.[13] He also starred in the 2003 London production of Martin McDonagh's The Pillowman.[22]
Tennant contributed to several audio dramatisations of Shakespeare for the Arkangel Shakespeare series (1998). His roles include a reprisal of his Antipholus of Syracuse in The Comedy of Errors, as well as Launcelot Gobbo in The Merchant of Venice, Edgar in King Lear, and Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet. In 1995, Tennant appeared at the Royal National Theatre, London, playing the role of Nicholas Beckett in Joe Orton's What the Butler Saw.

They married in 2011,[121] and live in the Chiswick district of London.[122] They have five children, including Ty Tennant, Moffett's child from a previous relationship whom Tennant adopted.[123]
Tennant has rarely discussed his private life in interviews, citing his belief that ""relationships are hard enough with the people you're having them with, let alone talking about them in public"".[13][124] Tennant, whose father was a Church of Scotland minister, believes religion ""must have"" shaped his character, and revealed that he is an occasional churchgoer.[125]
In 2016, Tennant was awarded an honorary doctorate in Drama by his alma mater, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.[126][127]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reset_(Torchwood),Reset (Torchwood),"""Reset"" is the sixth episode of the second series of the British science fiction television series Torchwood, which was broadcast on BBC Two on 20 February 2008, with an initial airing on BBC Three on 13 February.[1]
In the episode, the alien-hunting team Torchwood seeks to shut down a pharmaceutical company that is experimenting on live aliens to develop a drug that restores the human body to its ""factory settings"".
Jack recruits UNIT medical specialist Martha Jones to assist Torchwood after a series of deaths of drug trial subjects from the secure medical facility called the Pharm, which Martha, and Torchwood's medic Owen, identify as murders. Further investigation shows that the murder victims have previously suffered from incurable diseases such as diabetes and HIV, but were cured of them prior to their deaths. One victim, Marie, still alive when Torchwood find her, dies while being questioned and fly-like creatures erupt from her mouth.
Jack detects a strong presence of alien life forms within the Pharm, and the facility's security system proves to be beyond the ability of Torchwood to hack from the outside. Martha offers to infiltrate the facility disguised as a human test subject and is accepted after claiming to be infected with hepatitis. Once inside, Martha discovers that the Pharm uses a substance called Reset that releases alien parasites called Mayflies into the host's body. The parasites cure the patient of any diseases and restore them to ""factory settings"", but at the price of infecting the patient with the parasite. When the eggs hatch, the creatures destroy the host. The director, Professor Aaron Copley, injects Martha with multiple doses of Reset, curious to determine the effect of Mayflies on her immune system, which has changed from travelling in time.
Martha compromises the Pharm's computer systems. Torchwood discover Billy, the assassin employed by the Pharm to dispose of research subjects, and realise he is about to kill the last living test subject. Ianto and Gwen apprehend Billy and return him to the Hub for questioning. Billy is infected with Mayflies, likely contracted from one of his previous victims, and Owen kills him by improperly using the singularity scalpel. The team rush to the Pharm hidden in Billy's vehicle, using his corpse in the driver's seat to fool the security guards into letting them inside the compound.
Within the Pharm, they find numerous aliens being used to produce various test substances, including the mature Mayfly that is the source of Reset. Owen successfully uses the singularity scalpel to neutralise the Mayfly within Martha. Jack orders Toshiko to shut down the Pharm, euthanising all of the trapped aliens with inert gases, and crashing all computer systems. Before the team depart, Copley kills Owen by shooting him in the chest and Jack responds by shooting and killing Copley.
""Reset"" was the first episode of the second series to have an advance broadcast on the digital channel BBC Three ahead of its terrestrial debut. The episode was first broadcast on BBC Three on 13 February 2008 at 9.50pm. It received its first terrestrial broadcast a week later, 20 February, at 9.00pm on BBC Two. A pre-watershed version of the episode was aired at 7.00pm 21 February 2008.[2] According to consolidated figures the episode's BBC Three broadcast was watched by 850,000 viewers, its BBC Two debut by 3.22 million viewers and the pre-watershed version by 0.96 million viewers, amounting to an aggregated total of 5.03 million viewers across its three initial showings.[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_languages,Iranian languages,"The Iranian languages, or the Iranic languages,[1][2] are a branch of the Indo-Iranian languages in the Indo-European language family that are spoken natively by the Iranian peoples, mainly in the Iranian Plateau.
The Iranian languages are grouped in three stages: Old Iranian (until 400 BCE), Middle Iranian (400 BCE – 900 CE) and New Iranian (since 900 CE). The two directly attested Old Iranian languages are Old Persian (from the Achaemenid Empire) and Old Avestan (the language of the Avesta). Avesta predates Old Iranian language, Old Avestan (c. 1500 – 900 BCE)[8] and Younger Avestan (c. 900 – 400 BCE).[9] Of the Middle Iranian languages, the better understood and recorded ones are Middle Persian (from the Sasanian Empire), Parthian (from the Parthian Empire), and Bactrian (from the Kushan and Hephthalite empires).
As of 2000s[update], Ethnologue estimates that there are 86 languages in the group.[3]

The term Iran derives directly from Middle Persian Ērān, first attested in a third-century inscription at Naqsh-e Rostam, with the accompanying Parthian inscription using the term Aryān, in reference to the Iranian peoples.[8] The Middle-Iranian ērān and aryān are oblique plural forms of gentilic nouns ēr- (Middle Persian) and ary- (Parthian), both deriving from Proto-Iranian language *arya- (meaning ""Aryan"", i.e. ""of the Iranians"").[8][9] In the Iranic languages spoken on the plateau, the gentilic is attested as a self-identifier, included in ancient inscriptions and the literature of the Avesta,[10][note 1] and remains also in other Iranian ethnic names Alan (Ossetian: Ир Ir) and Iron (Ирон).[9]
When used as a linguistic term Iranian is applied to any language which descends from the ancestral Proto-Iranian language.[11]
Some scholars such as John R. Perry prefer the term Iranic as the anthropological name for the linguistic family and ethnic groups of this category, and Iranian for anything about the modern country of Iran. He uses the same analogue as in differentiating German from Germanic, Finnish from Finnic, or differentiating Turkish and Turkic.[12]
This use of the term for the Iranian language family was introduced in 1836 by Christian Lassen.[13] Robert Needham Cust used the term Irano-Aryan in 1878,[14] and Orientalists such as George Abraham Grierson and Max Müller contrasted Irano-Aryan (Iranian) and Indo-Aryan (Indic[note 2]). Some recent scholarship, primarily in German, has revived this convention.[15][16][17][18]
The Iranian languages are divided into the following branches:
According to modern scholarship, the Avestan languages are not considered to fall under these categories, and are instead sometimes classified as Central Iranian, since they diverged from Proto-Iranian before the east–west division rose to prominence. It has traditionally been viewed as Eastern Iranian; however, it lacks a large number of Eastern Iranian features and thus is only ""Eastern Iranian"" in the sense that it is not Western.[19]
The Iranian languages all descend from a common ancestor: Proto-Iranian, which itself evolved from Proto-Indo-Iranian. This ancestor language is speculated to have origins in Central Asia, and the Andronovo culture of the Bronze Age is suggested as a candidate for the common Indo-Iranian culture around 2000 BCE.[citation needed]
The language was situated precisely in the western part of Central Asia that borders present-day Russia and Kazakhstan. It was thus in relative proximity to the other satem ethno-linguistic groups of the Indo-European family, such as Thracian, Balto-Slavic and others, and to common Indo-European's original homeland (more precisely, the Pontic-Caspian Steppe to the north of the Black Sea and the Caucasus), according to the reconstructed linguistic relationships of common Indo-European.
Proto-Iranian thus dates to some time after the Proto-Indo-Iranian breakup, or the early-2nd millennium BCE, as the Old Iranian languages began to break off and evolve separately as the various Iranian tribes migrated and settled in vast areas of southeastern Europe, the Iranian Plateau, and Central Asia.
Proto-Iranian innovations compared to Proto-Indo-Iranian include:[20] the turning of sibilant fricative *s into non-sibilant fricative glottal *h; the voiced aspirated plosives *bʰ, *dʰ, *gʰ yielding to the voiced unaspirated plosives *b, *d, *g resp.; the voiceless unaspirated stops *p, *t, *k before another consonant changing into fricatives *f, *θ, *x resp.; voiceless aspirated stops *pʰ, *tʰ, *kʰ turning into fricatives *f, *θ, *x, resp.
The multitude of Middle Iranian languages and peoples indicate that great linguistic diversity must have existed among the ancient speakers of Iranian languages. Of that variety of languages/dialects, direct evidence of only two has survived. These are:
Indirectly attested Old Iranian languages are discussed below.
Old Persian was an Old Iranian dialect as it was spoken in southwestern Iran (the modern-day province of Fars) by the inhabitants of Parsa, Persia, or Persis who also gave their name to their region and language. Genuine Old Persian is best attested in one of the three languages of the Behistun inscription, composed c. 520 BCE, and which is the last inscription (and only inscription of significant length) in which Old Persian is still grammatically correct. Later inscriptions are comparatively brief, and typically simply copies of words and phrases from earlier ones, often with grammatical errors, which suggests that by the 4th century BCE the transition from Old Persian to Middle Persian was already far advanced, but efforts were still being made to retain an ""old"" quality for official proclamations.
The other directly attested Old Iranian dialects are the two forms of Avestan, which take their name from their use in the Avesta, the liturgical texts of indigenous Iranian religion that now goes by the name of Zoroastrianism but in the Avesta itself is simply known as vohu daena (later: behdin). The language of the Avesta is subdivided into two dialects, conventionally known as ""Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan"", and ""Younger Avestan"". These terms, which date to the 19th century, are slightly misleading since 'Younger Avestan' is not only much younger than 'Old Avestan', but also from a different geographic region. The Old Avestan dialect is very archaic, and at roughly the same stage of development as Rigvedic Sanskrit. On the other hand, Younger Avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as Old Persian, but by virtue of its use as a sacred language retained its ""old"" characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had yielded to their Middle Iranian stage. Unlike Old Persian, which has Middle Persian as its known successor, Avestan has no clearly identifiable Middle Iranian stage (the effect of Middle Iranian is indistinguishable from effects due to other causes).
In addition to Old Persian and Avestan, which are the only directly attested Old Iranian languages, all Middle Iranian languages must have had a predecessor ""Old Iranian"" form of that language, and thus can all be said to have had an (at least hypothetical) ""Old"" form. Such hypothetical Old Iranian languages include Old Parthian. Additionally, the existence of unattested languages can sometimes be inferred from the impact they had on neighbouring languages. Such transfer is known to have occurred for Old Persian, which has (what is called) a ""Median"" substrate in some of its vocabulary.[22] Also, foreign references to languages can also provide a hint to the existence of otherwise unattested languages, for example through toponyms/ethnonyms or in the recording of vocabulary, as Herodotus did for what he called ""Scythian"" and in one instance, Median (σπάκα ""dog"").
Conventionally, Iranian languages are grouped into ""western"" and ""eastern"" branches.[23] These terms have little meaning with respect to Old Avestan as that stage of the language may predate the settling of the Iranian peoples into western and eastern groups. The geographic terms also have little meaning when applied to Younger Avestan since it is not known where that dialect (or dialects) was spoken either. Certain is only that Avestan (all forms) and Old Persian are distinct, and since Old Persian is ""western"", and Avestan was not Old Persian, Avestan acquired a default assignment to ""eastern"". Further confusing the issue is the introduction of a western Iranian substrate in later Avestan compositions and redactions undertaken at the centers of imperial power in western Iran (either in the south-west in Persia, or in the north-west in Nisa/Parthia and Ecbatana/Media).
Two of the earliest dialectal divisions among Iranian indeed happen to not follow the later division into Western and Eastern blocks. These concern the fate of the Proto-Indo-Iranian first-series palatal consonants, *ć and *dź:[24]
As a common intermediate stage, it is possible to reconstruct depalatalized affricates: *c, *dz. (This coincides with the state of affairs in the neighboring Nuristani languages.) A further complication however concerns the consonant clusters *ćw and *dźw:
A division of Iranian languages in at least three groups during the Old Iranian period is thus implied:
It is possible that other distinct dialect groups were already in existence during this period. Good candidates are the hypothetical ancestor languages of Alanian/Scytho-Sarmatian subgroup of Scythian in the far northwest; and the hypothetical ""Old Parthian"" (the Old Iranian ancestor of Parthian) in the near northwest, where original *dw > *b (paralleling the development of *ćw).
What is known in Iranian linguistic history as the ""Middle Iranian"" era is thought to begin around the 4th century BCE lasting through the 9th century. Linguistically the Middle Iranian languages are conventionally classified into two main groups, Western and Eastern.
The Western family includes Parthian (Arsacid Pahlavi) and Middle Persian, while Bactrian, Sogdian, Khwarezmian, Saka, and Old Ossetic (Scytho-Sarmatian) fall under the Eastern category. The two languages of the Western group were linguistically very close to each other, but quite distinct from their eastern counterparts. On the other hand, the Eastern group was an areal entity whose languages retained some similarity to Avestan. They were inscribed in various Aramaic-derived alphabets which had ultimately evolved from the Achaemenid Imperial Aramaic script, though Bactrian was written using an adapted Greek script.
Middle Persian (Pahlavi) was the official language under the Sasanian dynasty in Iran. It was in use from the 3rd century CE until the beginning of the 10th century. The script used for Middle Persian in this era underwent significant maturity. Middle Persian, Parthian, and Sogdian were also used as literary languages by the Manichaeans, whose texts also survive in various non-Iranian languages, from Latin to Chinese. Manichaean texts were written in a script closely akin to the Syriac script.[25] The Achomi (Larestani/Khodmooni) language is considered a surviving remains of Pahlavi Middle Persian,[26][27][28][29][30][31][32] as well as Luri, with their respective dialects.
Following the Muslim conquest of Persia, there were essential changes in the role of the different dialects. The old prestige form of Middle Iranian, Pahlavi, which was associated with the western Sasanian provinces of Spahan and Pars, was replaced by a new variety as the official language of the court. In 875, the Saffarid dynasty was the first in a line of many dynasties to adopt the new prestige language officially.
West Iranian varieties from eastern regions may have had a significant impact on the development of the new standard, which served as the basis for a standardised New Persian. Medieval Iranian scholars such as ibn al-Muqaffa' (8th century) and ibn al-Nadim (10th century) associated the term Dari with the eastern province of Khorasan, Pahlavi for the dialects of the northwestern areas between the province of Isfahan and Azerbaijan, and Pârsi to describe the dialects of Fars (Persia).
These scholars also noted that the unofficial language of the royalty was Khuzi, associated with the western province of Khuzestan; it was likely a late variety of the Elamite language, a language isolate that previously was the official court language of Elam in that region.
The Islamic conquest also brought with it the adoption of the Arabic script for writing Persian and much later, Kurdish, Pashto and Balochi. All three were adapted to the writing by the addition of a few letters. This development probably occurred sometime during the second half of the 8th century, when the old middle Persian script began dwindling in usage. The Arabic script remains in use in contemporary modern Persian. The Tajik alphabet, used to write the Tajik language, was initially Romanized in the 1920s under the Soviet nationalities policy. This was shifted to a Cyrillic script in the 1930s.
The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran, and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Eastern Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, in what is now Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the Eastern Iranian-speaking Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans, had been decisively Slavicised by the various Early Slavs of the region by the 6th century.[33][34][35][36] This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative, Yaghnobi, barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan Range east of Samarkand, Wakhi is spoken by nomadic pastoralists from Afghanistan to China, and Saka survives as Ossetic in Ciscaucasia, which is the sole remnant of the once-predominant Scythian languages of the region. Minority Eastern Iranian languages survive in the Pamir Mountains; Pashto is the only widely-spoken Eastern Iranian language, with at least 90 million speakers.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voysey_Inheritance,The Voysey Inheritance,"
The Voysey Inheritance is a play in five acts by the English dramatist Harley Granville-Barker.[1] Written in 1903–1905, it was originally staged at the Royal Court Theatre in 1905 featuring Mabel Hackney,[2] and revived at the same venue in 1965, the Royal Exchange, Manchester in 1989 and at the National Theatre in 1989, and in 2006.[3][4]
In 2006, American playwright David Mamet wrote what a critic for The New York Times called a ""canny new adaptation"" of the play for New York's Atlantic Theatre Company.[5]
Described by Samuel French as ""a witty, impeccably crafted portrait of a family in the midst of a surprisingly modern moral dilemma"",[6] its subject is financial fraud, on which Ian Clarke wrote, ""in The Voysey Inheritance, the dishonesty implicates not only the individual Voyseys but the institutions, ideology, and economic base of Edwardian England"".[7]
Edward's highly principled world upturns when he discovers the family business he is inheriting has been defrauding its clients for years because his father has been illegally speculating with their money. To compound matters, he quickly discovers his large, scandal-fearing family knew of the crime but allowed it to continue rather than face the shame of public disclosure.[8]
""Of course it's pleasant and comfortable to keep within the law . . . then the law will look after you. Otherwise you have to look pretty sharp after yourself. You have to cultivate your own sense of right and wrong . . . deal with your own justice. But that makes a bigger man of you, let me tell you.""[9]

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Exchange,_Manchester","Royal Exchange, Manchester","
The Royal Exchange is a grade II listed[1] building in Manchester, England. It is located in the city centre. The complex includes the Royal Exchange Theatre and the Royal Exchange Shopping Centre.
The cotton industry in Lancashire was served by the cotton importers and brokers based in Liverpool who supplied Manchester and surrounding towns with the raw material needed to spin yarns and produce finished textiles. The Liverpool Cotton Exchange traded in imported raw cotton. In the 18th century, the trade was part of the slave trade in which African slaves were transported to America where the cotton was grown and then exported to Liverpool where the raw cotton was sold.[2] The raw cotton was processed in Manchester and the surrounding cotton towns and Manchester Royal Exchange traded in spun yarn and finished goods throughout the world including Africa. Manchester's first exchange opened in 1729 but closed by the end of the century.[3]
As the cotton industry boomed, the need for a new exchange was recognised. Thomas Harrison designed the second exchange, completed in 1809, at the junction of Market Street and Exchange Street.[2] Harrison designed the exchange in the Classical style. It had two storeys above a basement and was constructed in Runcorn stone. The cost, £20,000, was paid for in advance by 400 members who bought £50 shares and paid £30 each to buy the site. The semi-circular north façade had fluted Doric columns. The exchange room where business was conducted covered 812 square yards. The ground floor also contained the members' library with more than 15,000 books. The basement housed a newsroom lit by a dome and plate-glass windows, its ceiling was supported by a circle of Ionic pillars spaced 15 feet (4.6 m) from the walls. The first-floor dining-room was accessed by a geometrical staircase. The exchange opened to celebrate the birthday of George III in 1809. It also contained other anterooms and offices.[4]
As the cotton trade continued to expand, larger premises were required and its extension was completed in 1849. The design featured a huge new Doric order portico. The Exchange was run by a committee of notable Manchester industrialists. From 1855 to 1860, the committee was chaired by Edmund Buckley.[5]
The second exchange was replaced by a third designed by Mills & Murgatroyd, constructed between 1867 and 1874.[6] It was extended and modified by Bradshaw Gass & Hope between 1914 and 1931 to form the largest trading hall in England.[6][7] In order to maximise the internal space, these modifications required the demolition of a huge Corinthian order portico on the Cross Street frontage which had former part of the Mills & Murgatroyd design.[8] The trading hall had three domes and was double the size of the current hall.[1] The colonnade parallel to Cross Street marked its centre. On trading days merchants and brokers struck deals which supported the jobs of tens of thousands of textile workers in Manchester and the surrounding towns.[2] Manchester's cotton dealers and manufacturers trading from the Royal Exchange earned the city the name, Cottonopolis.[9]
The exchange was seriously damaged during the Second World War when it took a direct hit from a bomb during a German air raid in the Manchester Blitz at Christmas in 1940. Its interior was rebuilt with a smaller trading area.[6][10] The top stages of the clock tower, which had been destroyed, were replaced in a simpler form. Trading ceased in 1968, and the building was threatened with demolition.[6][11]
The exchange has four storeys and two attic storeys built on a rectangular plan in Darley Dale stone. It was designed in the Classical style. Its slate roof has three glazed domes and on the ground floor an arcade orientated east to west. It has a central atrium at first-floor level. The ground floor facade has channelled rusticated piers and the first, second and third floors have Corinthian columns with entablature and a modillioned cornice. The first attic storey has a balustraded parapet while the second attic storey has a mansard roof. At the north-west corner is a Baroque turret and there are domes over other corners. The west side has a massive round-headed entrance arch with wide steps up and the first and second floor windows have round-headed arches. The third floor and first attic storey have mullioned windows.[1]
The building remained empty until 1973, when it was used to house a theatre company (69 Theatre Company); the company performed in a temporary theatre but there were plans for a permanent theatre whose cost was then estimated at £400,000.[12] The Royal Exchange Theatre was founded in 1976 by five artistic directors: Michael Elliott, Caspar Wrede, Richard Negri, James Maxwell and Braham Murray. The theatre was opened by Laurence Olivier on 15 September 1976.[13] In 1979, the artistic directorship was augmented by the appointment of Gregory Hersov.[14]
The building was damaged on 15 June 1996 when an IRA bomb exploded in Corporation Street less than 50 yards away. The blast caused the dome to move, although the main structure was undamaged.[15] That the adjacent St Ann's Church survived almost unscathed is probably due to the sheltering effect of the stone-built exchange. Repairs, which were undertaken by Birse Group,[16] took over two years and cost £32 million, a sum provided by the National Lottery.[17] While the exchange was rebuilt, the theatre company performed in Castlefield. The theatre was repaired and provided with a second performance space, the Studio, a bookshop, craft shop, restaurant, bars and rooms for corporate hospitality. The theatre's workshops, costume department and rehearsal rooms were moved to Swan Street. The refurbished theatre was re-opened on 30 November 1998 by Prince Edward. The opening production, Stanley Houghton's Hindle Wakes was the play that should have opened the day the bomb was exploded.[18]
In 1999 the Royal Exchange was awarded ""Theatre of the Year"" in the Barclays Theatre Awards, in recognition of its refurbishment and ambitious re-opening season.[19]
In January 2016, the Royal Exchange was awarded Regional Theatre of the Year by The Stage. In announcing the award, The Stage said: ""This was the year that artistic director Sarah Frankcom really hit her stride at the Royal Exchange. The Manchester theatre in the round's output during 2015 delivered its best year in quite some time.""[20]
In January 2018, the Royal Exchange Young Company won the ""School of the Year"" award at The Stage Awards 2018.[21]
On 28 March 2019, the Royal Exchange announced that Frankcom was stepping down as artistic director of the theatre to take up a new post as director of the prestigious drama school LAMDA. On 8 July 2019, the theatre announced the appointment of Bryony Shanahan and Roy Alexander Weise as joint artistic directors.[22]
The theatre features a seven-sided steel and glass module that squats within the building's Great Hall. It is a pure theatre in the round in which the stage area is surrounded on all sides, and above, by seating.[6] Its design is by Richard Negri of the Wimbledon School of Art. As the floor of the exchange was unable to take the weight of the theatre and its audience, the module is suspended from the four columns carrying the hall's central dome. Only the stage area and ground-level seating rest on the floor. The 150-ton theatre structure opened in 1976 at a cost of £1 million.[23]
The theatre can seat an audience of up to 800 on three levels, making it the largest theatre in the round in the world. There are 400 seats at ground level in a raked configuration, above which are two galleries, each with 150 seats set in two rows.[24]
The Studio is a 90-seat studio theatre with no fixed stage area and moveable seats, allowing for a variety of production styles (in the round, thrust etc.) Prior to 2020, the studio acted as host to a programme of visiting touring theatre companies, stand-up comedians and performances for young people.[25]
The company performs a varied programme including classic theatre and revivals, contemporary drama and new writing. Shakespeare, Ibsen and Chekhov have been the mainstay of its repertoire but the theatre has staged classics from other areas of the canon including the British premieres of La Ronde and The Prince of Homburg and revivals of The Lower Depths, Don Carlos and The Dybbuk. American work has also been important – Tennessee Williams, O'Neill, Miller, August Wilson – as has new writing, with the world premieres of The Dresser, Amongst Barbarians, A Wholly Healthy Glasgow and Port to its name.
The Royal Exchange also presents visiting theatre companies in the Studio; folk, jazz and rock concerts; and discussions, readings and literary events. It engages children of all ages in drama activities and groups and has performances including these children and teens. Performances include The Freedom Bird and The Boy Who Ran from the Sea.
The company has been run by a group of artistic directors since its inception. According to Braham Murray: -""Although the names have changed we have remained a team of like-minded individuals sharing a common vision of the purpose and potency of theatre.""[26] These individuals include[27][28]
In 2014 Sarah Frankcom became the sole artistic director.
Associate Artistic Directors include:-
Nicholas Hytner (1985–1989), Ian McDiarmid (1986–1988) and Phyllida Lloyd (1990–1991).
Many other directors have worked at the Royal Exchange amongst them Lucy Bailey, Michael Buffong, Robert Delamere, Jacob Murray, Adrian Noble, Steven Pimlott and Richard Wilson.
The company is renowned for its innovative designers, composers and choreographers which include Lez Brotherston, Johanna Bryant, Chris Monks, Alan Price, Jeremy Sams, Rae Smith and Mark Thomas.
Throughout its history the theatre has attracted great actors and a number of them have taken on many roles over the years. Actors who have been particularly associated with the Exchange and have appeared in several different productions include:[27][28]
In 2017, the Royal Exchange Theatre produced Jubilee, a stage adaptation of Derek Jarman’s film, directed and adapted by playwright Chris Goode. In 2021, Goode died by suicide shortly after being arrested on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children. In response to allegations that his work at Royal Exchange had been marked by abuse, the theatre joined with the Royal Court Theatre to commission an independent inquiry into working practices and safeguarding failures related to Goode's productions. The report concluded that several individuals had been “badly hurt,” and it called for improved safeguarding procedures across the UK theatre sector.[29] Survivors have since called on institutions to acknowledge their role in enabling abusive behavior by failing to act on warning signs.[30]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sink_or_Swim_(TV_series),Sink or Swim (TV series),"
Sink or Swim is a BBC TV sitcom created and written by Alex Shearer. It ran for three series between 4 December 1980 and 14 October 1982 and stars Peter Davison as Brian Webber and Robert Glenister as his brother Steve.
Brian lives in a flat above a petrol station in London (in the last series he moved to Newcastle to attend university). He's trying hard to make his way in the world, thus far with limited success. His girlfriend, Sonia, is a very serious minded young woman who is passionate only about things like vegetarianism and ecology. When Brian's younger brother, Steve, arrives in London looking for somewhere to stay, his lazy, cynical, noisy ""Northern lout"" attitude disrupts Brian's already messy life.
Like Only Fools and Horses, Sink or Swim was filmed in Bristol doubling for London. Shearer later wrote the Nicholas Lyndhurst sitcom The Two of Us for LWT. Production of the sitcom overlapped the first two years of Davison also starring as the Fifth Doctor in Doctor Who, which imposed constraints on the recording schedules.[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Brazil,Abortion in Brazil,"
Abortion is generally illegal in Brazil. Penalties range from one to three years of imprisonment for the recipient of the abortion, and one to four years of imprisonment for the doctor or any other person who performs the abortion on someone else. In three specific situations in Brazil, induced abortion is not punishable by law: in cases of risk to the pregnant woman’s life; when the pregnancy is the result of rape; and if the fetus is anencephalic.[1][2] In these cases, the Brazilian government provides the abortion procedure free of charge through the Sistema Único de Saúde (Unified Health System). This does not mean that the law regards abortion in these cases as a right, but only that women who receive abortions under these circumstances, and the doctors, will not be punished.[3] The punishment for a woman who performs an abortion on herself or consents to an abortion performed by another outside these legal exceptions is one to three years of detention.[4] The base penalty for a third party that performs an illegal abortion with the consent of the patient, ranges from one to four years of detention, with the possibility of increase by a third if the woman comes to any physical harm, and can be doubled if she dies.[5] Criminal penalties fixed at four years or less can be converted to non-incarceration punishments, such as community service and compulsory donation to charity.[6]
Brazil is a signatory of the American Human Rights Convention, also called the Pact of San José. The Convention grants the right to life to human embryos, ""in general, from the moment of conception"", and has a legal status on a par with the Constitution in Brazilian Law. The Civil Code of Brazil also provides rights to fetuses and embryos. In a 2008 case, however, the Supreme Federal Court ruled, by a 6–5 vote, that the right to life applies only to intrauterine embryos, and that frozen embryos not eligible to a uterus transfer do not hold fundamental rights and may be used for research purposes.[citation needed] In 2012, the Supreme Court also authorized the abortion of anencephalic fetuses.
On November 29, 2016, the Supreme Court in Brazil ruled in a non-binding decision that ""abortion should not be a crime when performed in the first three months of pregnancy"".[7] This ruling was controversial because the Brazilian government had passed a bill earlier in 2016 which aimed to make Brazilian law on abortion even stricter.[8] As of September 2023, the Court is considering a case that could decriminalise abortion up to twelve weeks; in one of her final statements before retiring as the Court's President, Rosa Weber, made a public statement stating that motherhood should be a choice and not an obligation.[9]
As of October 2025, an abortion can be performed in Brazil only if the pregnancy is a case of rape, is life-threatening to the pregnant woman, or if the baby is anencephalic[10]. The above mentioned case of decriminalising abortion up to twelve weeks has not been enacted as a date for a vote in the Congress's Chamber of Deputies has not been set yet[11].
Abortion was criminalized in all circumstances in the penal code from 1890.[12]  In 1940, the penal code provisions on abortion waived punishment on abortion in the case of rape or incest, or if the pregnant women's life was in danger.[13]  A presidential decree in 1941, as amended in 1979, banned the advertising of a process, substance, or object designed to prevent pregnancy or cause an abortion.[14]
The number of clandestine abortions taking place in Brazil is a controversial subject which divides anti-abortion and abortion rights activists.[15] A study published by the International Journal of Women's Health in 2014, estimated that in Brazil about 48 thousand clandestine abortions occurs annually.[16] Abortion rights institutes like Anis - Bioethics Institute, however, estimate a much higher number.[17]
More recent studies published in the International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics suggest that, despite Brazil's severe legislation, 500,000 illegal abortions are estimated to occur every year among women aged 18–39 years – or one in five Brazilian women.[18]
In 2010, it was reported that 200,000 women a year were hospitalized for complications due to abortion (which includes both miscarriages and clandestine abortions). More recent figures estimate that around 250,000 women are hospitalized every year due to illegal abortion complications, or 50% of all illegal abortions estimated per year.[19] Those figures contrast with 2–5% of women requiring medical care after an abortion in countries where abortion is legal.[20] The majority of women admitted at hospital after an illegal abortion are uninsured, representing a government cost of more than US$10 million every year.[21] More than 200 women die every year in Brazil, as a direct consequence of unsafe abortions. The prevalence of reproductive complications and other negative health consequences associated with illegal abortion is unknown.[19]
In a 2005 survey, one third of the Brazilian doctors who reported having performed abortions, used dilation and curettage. They have little experience with vacuum aspiration but they are aware of it as a method. They have a general awareness of medical abortion using misoprostol (Cytotec) or other prostaglandins to induce abortion but less experience with it. Few know of newer and more effective regimens using mifepristone or methotrexate.[22]
The 2005 survey also found considerable ignorance of Brazil's law on abortion, with only 48% of the physicians knowing that it is legal to save a woman's life and widespread confusion about fetal age limits. An earlier survey found that two-thirds of Brazilian OB-GYNs incorrectly believed that a judicial order is required to obtain a legal abortion and only 27% knew that the woman needed to make a written request to obtain a legal abortion. Those doctors cannot give accurate information to their patients.[22]
In non-hospital settings, women's folk medicine allegedly brings on the menstrual flow rather than causing an abortion. ""Two folk medical conditions, ""delayed"" (atrasada) and ""suspended"" (suspendida) menstruation, are described as perceived by poor Brazilian women in Northeast Brazil. Culturally prescribed methods to ""regulate"" these conditions and induce menstrual bleeding are also described, including ingesting herbal remedies, patent drugs, and modern pharmaceuticals.""[23]
Some women, if financially able, will travel abroad to have abortions, with Cuba, Mexico, Guyana, Aruba, Curacao, French Guiana, and the United States being some of the countries women travel to.[24]
The modern abortion debate can be traced back to feminist movements of the 1970s.[25] Since then, abortion has become a contentious issue within Brazil. Between 2000 and 2010, anti-abortion stances could be observed in a variety of political parties and stances and was largely influenced by the role of religion.[26]
In 2005, a committee established by then-President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva attempted to reform abortion laws but was stopped by the Commission on Social Security and Family.[26] In 2024, Federal Deputy Sóstenes Cavalcante introduced PL 1904/2024, which would classify all abortions done after 22 weeks as homicide.[27]
The Socialism and Liberty Party seeks to decriminalise abortion in Brazil.[28]
[citation needed] In a survey made in Ribeirão Preto (SP) in 2004, 70% of the Brazilian doctors responded that they didn't support the decriminalization of abortion in the country.[29] The survey also suggested that 77% of the doctors of this region rejected the opinion that abortion should be carried out solely because of the woman's desire.[29] Furthermore it suggested that 82.5% of these doctors also reject the legalization of abortion due to socioeconomic difficulties.[29] Finally, in the case of a possible legalization, 17.5% of them would agree to carry it out professionally.[29]
A March 2007 Datafolha/Folha de S.Paulo poll found that 65% of Brazilians believe that their country's current law ""should not be modified"", 16% that it should be expanded ""to allow abortion in other cases"", 10% that abortion should be ""decriminalized"", and 5% were ""not sure"".[30]
Another poll on this issue was made in December 2010, by the polling institute Vox Populi.  This study revealed that 82% of Brazilians consider that the current law on abortion should not be modified, while 14% consider that abortion should be decriminalized, and 4% declare to have no position on the matter.[31]
In case of fetuses with microcephaly caused by Zika virus, 58% of the population expressed opposition.[32]
Following the impeachment of former leftist President Dilma Rousseff, A survey of the Instituto Patricia Galvão, in 2017, showed that 62% of Brazilians opposed the idea of the legalization of abortion, while 26% supported the measure, another 10% could not answer.[33] The opinion polls carried out by the Paraná Research Institute in the same year also concluded that 86.5% of Brazilians were against the decriminalization.[34]
According to the Ibope (largest research institute in Brazil), in 2018, eight out of ten Brazilians oppose legalization.[35] In a survey conducted in 2018, by the Datafolha Institute, 41% of Brazilians declared themselves in favor of a complete ban on abortion, 34% said they wanted to keep the legislation as it is, 16% said that they wanted to expand it to more situations and 6% said they were in favor of legalizing abortion under any circumstances.[36] The anti-abortion view is also followed by the majority of federal deputies, which makes it virtually impossible to attempt to legalize abortion through the Legislative Branch.[37] All of this has led the small group of abortion supporters to appeal to the Supreme Court, claiming that criminalization of abortion, ""violates fundamental human precepts"".[37][failed verification][citation needed]
In 2021, a survey conducted by PoderData found that 58% of Brazilians are against the legalization of abortion in Brazil; those who are favorable of legalization add up to 31%. Another 11% did not know or did not respond.[38]  Another survey conducted in 2021 by Paraná Pesquisas, however, found that 79% of Brazilians remain against the legalization of abortion, and 16.6% are favorable to it.[39][40][41]
In all the surveys carried out, in general, Brazilians are considered one of the peoples least in favor of legalizing abortion.[42] Currently, Brazil is the biggest country in the world to ban abortion in the name of the recognition of the rights of the unborn.[43]
In March 2009, after an abortion on a nine-year-old girl raped by her stepfather and pregnant with twins had been performed because of the rape exception clause in Brazil’s Penal Code, Archbishop José Cardoso Sobrinho of Olinda and Recife stated that automatic excommunication had been incurred by the girl's mother and the medical team. President Lula da Silva and Health Minister José Gomes Temporão decried his statement, and the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil disowned it, saying that the mother was certainly not excommunicated and there was insufficient evidence to show that any member of the medical team was. The statement was criticized also on the Vatican newspaper by the President of the Pontifical Academy for Life. One of the doctors concerned said the controversy had drawn needed attention to Brazil's restrictive abortion laws.[44][45][46][47]
In July 2004, a Brazilian federal judge issued a preliminary ruling that waived the requirement for court authorization for abortions in cases of fetuses with anencephaly.[48] The Brazilian Council of Bishops lobbied against the ruling and the National Confederation of Healthcare Workers wanted to make the exception permanent. In October 2004, the full Brazilian Supreme Court convened and voted 7–4 to suspend the judge's ruling until the full tribunal had the opportunity to deliberate and rule on the matter.[22]
A 2005 study found that 53% of doctors had performed an abortion in the case of a severely deformed fetus, even though that was not allowed by Brazilian law without a court order. Doctors who thought that the law should be more liberal were more likely to have correct knowledge of abortion law and to be familiar with the abortion law regarding severe fetal malformations.[22]
On April 12, 2012, the Supreme Federal Court ruled by an 8–2 vote to legalize abortion in cases of fetuses with anencephaly, saying that children with anencephaly were biologically alive but that they were not a person, and therefore had no rights. The Catholic Church and Brazilian Pro-Life movements criticized the decision of the court, saying that even with a terminal illness, children with anencephaly also had the right to life.[49]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotiana_glauca,Nicotiana glauca,"
Nicotiana glauca is a species of flowering plant in the tobacco genus Nicotiana of the nightshade family Solanaceae. It is known by the common name tree tobacco. Its leaves are attached to the stalk by petioles (many other Nicotiana species have sessile leaves), and its leaves and stems are neither pubescent nor sticky like Nicotiana tabacum. It resembles Cestrum parqui but differs in the form of leaves and fusion of the outer floral parts. It grows to heights of more than two meters.
Tree tobacco is native to South America but it is now widespread as an introduced species on other continents. It is a common roadside weed in the southwestern United States, and an invasive plant species in California native plant habitats.
Nicotiana glauca is a small tree or shrub with many branches that normally grows to over 2 m, but can reach as high as 7 m. Its leaves are thick and rubbery and can be up to 20 cm long. It has yellow tubular flowers about 5 cm long and 1 cm wide. The plant primarily reproduces by seed.[2]
Nicotiana glauca can pose a threat to native species by outcompeting them for resources and is classified as an invasive species in many parts of the world. In some management programmes, the beetle Malabris aculeata has been successfully deployed as a biological control agent. Every part of the plant is potentially poisonous to humans and livestock.[2]
It is originally native to South America (including Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador),[1] but has been naturalized globally. It is found in Australia, warmer parts of Europe, temperate Asia, Canarian Archipelago, New Zealand, the United States, Mexico, Hawaii, and Sub-Saharan Africa (including Kenya and Tanzania, where it is invasive, as well as Uganda).[2]
It grows in a wide variety of open and disturbed habitats including lakeshores and roadsides, but is mainly a problem in relatively dry areas.[2]
The plant is commonly known in English as tree tobacco, Brazilian tree tobacco, shrub tobacco, wild tobacco, tobacco tree, tobacco bush, tobacco plant, and mustard tree.[2]
In Spanish and throughout Latin America, it is known by many names, including tabaco moro (""Moorish tobacco""),[1] palancho, and palán palán.[3]
Its botanical name, Nicotiana glauca, was given to it in 1828 by Robert Graham.[1][4] The genus is named after Jean Nicot (c. 1530 – 1604), a French ambassador to Portugal, who sent tobacco seeds and powdered leaves from Lisbon to France.[5][6]
There are around 76 species in the Nicotiana genus,[1] the sole member of the Nicotianeae tribe. Phylogenetic research suggests the following species are closely related:[7]
N. acaulis Speg.
N. glauca Graham
N. noctiflora Hook.
N. petunioides (Griseb.) Millán
The plant is used for a variety of medicinal purposes by Native American groups.[8] The Cahuilla people used leaves interchangeably with other tobacco species in religious rituals and as a poultice to treat swellings, bruises, cuts, wounds, boils, sores, inflamed throat, and swollen glands. It contains high doses of the alkaloids anabasine and nicotine such that ingestion of the leaves can be fatal.[9] It is being investigated for use as a biofuel.[10]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intact_dilation_and_extraction,Intact dilation and extraction,"Intact dilation and extraction (D&X, IDX, or intact D&E) is a surgical procedure that terminates and removes an intact fetus from the uterus. The procedure is used both after miscarriages and for abortions in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. When used to perform an abortion, an intact D&E can occur after feticide or on a live fetus.

In the United States, where federal law describes an intact D&E on a live fetus as a partial-birth abortion,[1][2] the procedure is uncommon. For example, in 2000, only 0.17% of all abortions in the United States (2,232 of 1,313,000) were performed using an intact D&E.[3] Around that time, its usage became a focal point of the U.S. abortion debate. The 2003 federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart,[1][4] outlaws an intact D&E of a fetus with a heartbeat under most, though not all, circumstances.As with non-intact D&E or labor induction in the second trimester, the purpose of D&E is to end a pregnancy by removing the fetus and placenta. Patients who have a fetus diagnosed with severe congenital anomalies may prefer an intact procedure to allow for viewing of the remains, grieving, and achieving closure.[4][5] In cases where an autopsy has been requested, an intact procedure allows for a more complete examination of the body.
An intact D&E is also used in abortions to minimize the passage of instruments into the uterus, reducing the risk of trauma. It also reduces the risk of cervical lacerations that may be caused by the removal of bony parts from the uterus and the risk of retention of fetal parts in the uterus such as brain matter and tissue.[4]
As with non-intact D&E, intact D&E may be performed in freestanding clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, and in hospitals. Intra-operative pain control is usually dependent on the setting and patient characteristics but commonly involves local analgesia with either IV sedation or general anesthesia. Preoperative antibiotics are administered to reduce the risk of infection.[6] In cases where the woman is Rh-negative, Rho(D) immunoglobulin (RhoGam) is administered to prevent the risk of developing erythroblastosis fetalis (hemolytic disease of the newborn) in subsequent pregnancies.[5] Intact D&E is more feasible among women with higher parity, at higher gestational ages, and when cervical dilation is greater.[4] There are no absolute contraindications.
The surgery is preceded by cervical preparation, which may take several days. Osmotic dilators, natural or synthetic rods that absorb moisture from the cervix, are placed in the cervix and mechanically dilate the cervix over the course of hours to days. Misoprostol can be used to soften the cervix further. Intact D&E can only be performed with 2–5 centimeters of cervical dilation.[5]
Fetal injection of digoxin or potassium chloride may be administered at the beginning of the procedure to allow for softening of the fetal bones or to comply with relevant laws in the physician's jurisdiction and the U.S. federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.[4] Umbilical cord transection can also be used to induce fetal demise prior to removal.[7]
During the surgery, the fetus is removed from the uterus in the breech position. If the fetal presentation is not breech, forceps or manual manipulation can be used to turn it to a breech presentation while in the uterus (internal version).[6] The fetal skull is usually the largest part of the fetal body and its removal may require mechanical collapse if it is too large to fit through the cervical canal.[5] Decompression of the skull can be accomplished by incision and suction of the brain or by using forceps to collapse the skull.[4]
Recovery from an intact D&E is similar to recovery from a non-intact D&E. Postoperative pain is usually minimal and managed with NSAIDs. In cases of uterine atony and corresponding blood loss, methergine or misoprostol can be given to encourage uterine contraction and achieve hemostasis.[5] Patients who have recently undergone an intact D&E are monitored for signs of coagulopathy, uterine perforation, uterine atony, retained tissue, or hemorrhage.[4]
The risks of intact D&E are similar to the risks of non-intact D&E and include postoperative infection, hemorrhage, or uterine injury. Overall, the complication rate is low, with rates of serious complications (those requiring blood transfusion, surgery, or hospital treatment) ranging from 0 per 1,000 cases to 2.94 per 1,000 cases. The rate of minor complications is approximately 50 in 1,000 (5%), the same as the minor complication rate for non-intact D&E; the rate of serious complications is higher in non-intact D&E.[4]
Data directly comparing the safety of non-intact to intact D&E are limited.[8] There is no difference in postoperative blood loss or major complications when compared to non-intact D&E.[8][9] There is no difference in risk of subsequent preterm delivery.[10][9] The risk of retained tissue is lower since the fetus is removed intact.[6]
In some cases, the physician may not be able to remove the fetus intact due to anatomical limitations. This may present a psychological problem for the patient who wishes to view the remains, or make a comprehensive autopsy impossible, precluding an accurate postmortem diagnosis of fetal anomalies.[4]
The term ""partial-birth abortion"" is primarily used in political discourse—chiefly regarding the legality of abortion in the United States.[11] The term is not recognized as a medical term by the American Medical Association[12] nor the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.[13] This term was first suggested in 1995 by Congressman Charles T. Canady, while developing the original proposed Partial-Birth Abortion Ban.[14][15] According to Keri Folmar, the lawyer responsible for the bill's language, the term was developed in early 1995 in a meeting among herself, Charles T. Canady, and National Right to Life Committee lobbyist Douglas Johnson.[16] Canady could not find this particular abortion practice named in any medical textbook, and therefore he and his aides named it.[17] ""Partial-birth abortion"" was first used in the media on June 4, 1995, in a Washington Times article covering the bill.[citation needed]
In the U.S., a federal statute defines ""partial-birth abortion"" as any abortion in which the life of the fetus is terminated after having been extracted from the mother's body to a point ""past the navel [of the fetus]"" or ""in the case of head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother"" at the time the life is terminated. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the terms ""partial-birth abortion"" and ""intact dilation and extraction"" are basically synonymous.[18] However, there are cases where these overlapping terms do not coincide. For example, the intact D&E procedure may be used to remove a deceased fetus (e.g., due to a miscarriage or feticide) that is developed enough to require dilation of the cervix for its extraction.[19] Removing a dead fetus does not meet the federal legal definition of ""partial-birth abortion,"" which specifies that partial live delivery must precede ""the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered, living fetus.""[20]
In addition to the federal ban, there have also been a number of state partial-birth abortion bans. There, courts have found that state legislation (rather than federal legislation) intended to ban ""partial-birth abortions"" could be interpreted to apply to some non-intact dilation and evacuation (D&E) procedures.[21] Non-intact D&E, though performed at similar gestational ages, is a fundamentally different procedure.
Some people believe the D&E procedure illustrates that abortion, and especially late-term abortion, is the taking of a human life and therefore ought to be illegal. People who believe this consider the procedure to be infanticide,[22] a position that many in the anti-abortion movement extend to cover all abortions.[23] Some advocates, both for and against abortion rights, see the intact D&E issue as a central battleground in the wider abortion debate, attempting to set a legal precedent so as to either gradually reduce or gradually increase access to all abortion methods.[24]
Dr. Martin Haskell has called the intact D&E procedure ""a quick, surgical outpatient method"" for late second-trimester and early third-trimester abortions.[25] The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 describes it as ""a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary.""[26]
According to a BBC report about the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Gonzales v. Carhart, ""government lawyers and others who favour the ban, have said there are alternative and more widely used procedures that are still legal - which involves dismembering the fetus in the uterus.""[27] An article in Harper's magazine stated that, ""Defending the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban... requires arguing to judges that pulling a fetus from a woman's body in dismembered pieces is legal, medically acceptable, and safe; but that pulling a fetus out intact, so that if the woman wishes the fetus can be wrapped in a blanket and handed to her, is appropriately punishable by a fine, or up to two years' imprisonment, or both.""[16] Alternately, opponents of abortion rights frame the issue as one in which a partially-born infant's life is disposable, whereas pulling the infant only a few more inches down the birth canal automatically transforms it into ""a living person, possessing rights and deserving of protection.""[28] The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that intact D&E remains legal as long as there is first a feticidal injection while the fetus is still completely inside of the mother's body.[19]
There is also controversy about why this procedure is used. Although prominent defenders of the method asserted during 1995 and 1996 that it was used only or mostly in acute medical circumstances, lobbyist Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers (a trade association of abortion providers), told The New York Times (February 26, 1997): ""In the vast majority of cases, the procedure is performed on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus that is 20 weeks or more along.""[29]
Some prominent opponents of abortion rights quickly defended the accuracy of Fitzsimmons's statements,[30] whilst others condemned Fitzsimmons as self-serving.[31]
In support of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, a nurse who witnessed three intact D&E procedures found them deeply disturbing, and described one performed on a 26½-week fetus with Down syndrome in testimony before a Judiciary subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives.[32]
A journalist observed three intact and two non-intact D&E procedures involving fetuses ranging from 19 to 23 weeks. She ""watched for any signs of fetal distress, but ... [she] could see no response, no reflexive spasm, nothing. Whether this was a result of the anesthesia or an undeveloped fetal system for pain sensitivity, one thing was clear: There was no discernible response by the fetus.""[33]
Abortion provider Warren Hern asserted in 2003, ""No peer-reviewed articles or case reports have ever been published describing anything such as 'partial-birth' abortion, 'Intact D&E' (for 'dilation and extraction'), or any of its synonyms.""[34] Therefore, Hern expressed uncertainty about what all of these terms mean. The U.S. Supreme Court held in Gonzales v. Carhart that these terms of the federal statute are not vague because the statute specifically detailed the procedure being banned: it specified anatomical landmarks past which the fetus must not be delivered, and criminalized such a procedure only if an ""overt"" fatal act is performed on the fetus after ""partial delivery.""[18]
Since 1995, led by Republicans in Congress, the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate have moved several times to pass measures banning the procedure. Congress passed two such measures by wide margins during Bill Clinton's presidency, but Clinton vetoed those bills in April 1996 and October 1997 on the grounds that they did not include health exceptions. Subsequent congressional attempts at overriding the veto were unsuccessful.
A major part of the legal battle over banning the procedure relates to health exceptions, which would permit the procedure in special circumstances. The 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, which declared many state-level abortion restrictions unconstitutional, allowed states to ban abortions of post-viable fetuses unless an abortion was ""necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother."" The companion ruling, Doe v. Bolton, upheld against a vagueness challenge a state law that defined health to include mental as well as physical health. The Court has never explicitly held, as a matter of constitutional law, that states have to allow abortions of post-viable fetuses if doing so is necessary for the woman's mental health, but many read Doe as implying as much. The concern that the health exception can be read so liberally partly explains why supporters of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act did not want to include one.
In 2003, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (H.R. 760, S. 3) was signed into law; the House passed it on October 2 with a vote of 281–142, the Senate passed it on October 21 with a vote of 64–34, and President George W. Bush signed it into law on November 5.
Beginning in early 2004, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the National Abortion Federation, and abortion doctors in Nebraska challenged the ban in federal district courts in the Northern District of California, Southern District of New York, and District of Nebraska. All three district courts ruled the ban unconstitutional that same year. Their respective federal courts of appeals—the Ninth Circuit, Second Circuit, and Eighth Circuit, respectively—affirmed these rulings on appeal.
The three cases were all appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and were consolidated into the case Gonzales v. Carhart. On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court voted to uphold the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act by a decision of 5–4.[35] Justice Kennedy wrote for the majority and was joined by Justices Thomas, Scalia, Alito, and Chief Justice Roberts. A dissenting opinion was written by Justice Ginsburg and joined by Justices Stevens, Souter and Breyer.
Many states have bans on late-term abortions which apply to intact D&E if it is performed after fetal viability.
Many states have also passed bans specifically on intact D&E. The first was Ohio, which in 1995 enacted a law that referred to the procedure as dilation and extraction. In 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found the law unconstitutional on the grounds that it placed a substantial and unconstitutional obstacle in the path of women seeking pre-viability abortions in the second trimester.
Between 1995 and 2000, 28 more states passed Partial-Birth Abortion bans, all similar to the proposed federal bans and all lacking an exemption for the health of the woman. Many of these state laws faced legal challenges, with Nebraska's the first to reach decision in Stenberg v. Carhart. The Federal District Court held Nebraska's statute unconstitutional on two counts. One being the bill's language was too broad, potentially rendering a range of abortion procedures illegal, and thus, creating an undue burden on a woman's ability to choose. The other count was the bill failed to provide a necessary exception for the health of the woman. The decision was appealed to and affirmed by both the Eighth Circuit and the Supreme Court in June 2000, thus resolving the legal challenges to similar state bans nationwide.
Since the Stenberg v. Carhart decision, Virginia, Michigan, and Utah have adopted legislation very similar to the Nebraska law overturned as unconstitutional. The Michigan law was similarly struck down for broadness and failure to provide a health exemption. Utah's law remains on the books, pending trial, but is unenforceable under a court-ordered preliminary injunction. Virginia's Law was initially ruled invalid, but was reversed and remanded to the District Court in the wake of the Gonzales v. Carhart decision, where it was upheld as constitutional. This is despite the fact the Virginia law criminalizes abortions for accidental or intentional intact D&E.
In 2000, Ohio introduced another ""partial-birth abortion"" ban. The law differed from previous attempts at the ban in that it specifically excluded D&E procedures, while also providing a narrow health exception. This law was upheld on appeal to the Sixth Circuit in 2003 on the grounds that ""it permitted the partial birth procedure when necessary to prevent significant health risks.""
In 2003, the Michigan Senate introduced Senate Bill No. 395, which would have changed the definition of birth and therefore effectively ban intact D&E. The definition of birth as defined in the bill was that once any part of the body had passed beyond the introitus, it is considered a birth. The bill included an exemption for the mother's health. The bill was passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives but was vetoed by governor Jennifer Granholm.[36]
Since the passage of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in the United States and similar state laws, providers of later abortions typically induce and document fetal death before beginning any later abortion procedure. Since the bans only apply to abortions of living fetuses, this protects the abortion providers from prosecution. The most common method of inducing fetal demise is to inject digoxin intrafetally or potassium chloride intrathoracically.[5][37]
Questioned about the policy of the UK government on the issue in Parliament, Baroness Andrews stated that:
We are not aware of the procedure referred to as ""partial-birth abortion"" being used in Great Britain. It is the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) belief that this method of abortion is never used as a primary or pro-active technique and is only ever likely to be performed in unforeseen circumstances in order to reduce maternal mortality or severe morbidity.[38]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game,Action game,"An action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges, including hand–eye coordination and reaction time. The genre includes a large variety of sub-genres, such as fighting games, beat 'em ups, shooter games, rhythm games and platform games. Multiplayer online battle arena and some real-time strategy games are also considered action games.
In an action game, the player typically controls a character often in the form of a protagonist or avatar. This player character must navigate a level, collecting objects, avoiding obstacles, and battling enemies with their natural skills as well as weapons and other tools at their disposal. At the end of a level or group of levels, the player must often defeat a boss enemy that is more challenging and often a major antagonist in the game's story. Enemy attacks and obstacles deplete the player character's health and lives, and the player receives a game over when they run out of lives.
Alternatively, the player gets to the end of the game by finishing a sequence of levels to complete a final goal, and see the credits. Some action games, such as early arcade games, are unbeatable and have an indefinite number of levels. The player's only goal is to get as far as they can, to maximize their score.
The action genre includes any game where the player overcomes challenges by physical means such as precise aim and quick response times.[1] Action games can sometimes incorporate other challenges such as races, puzzles, or collecting objects, but they are not central to the genre. Players may encounter tactical and exploration challenges, but these games first-and-foremost require high reaction speed and good hand–eye coordination. The player is often under time pressure, and there is not enough time for complex strategic planning. In general, faster action games are more challenging. Action games may sometimes involve puzzle solving, but they are usually quite simple because the player is under immense time pressure.[2]
Players advance through an action game by completing a series of levels. Levels are often grouped by theme, with similar graphics and enemies called a world. Each level involves a variety of challenges, whether dancing in a dance game or shooting things in a shooter, which the player must overcome to win the game. Older games force players to restart a level after dying, although action games evolved to offer saved games and checkpoints to allow the player to restart partway through a level. The obstacles and enemies in a level do not usually vary between play sessions, allowing players to learn by trial and error. However, levels sometimes add an element of randomness, such as an enemy that randomly appears or that takes an unpredictable path.[2]
Levels in an action game may be linear or nonlinear, and sometimes include shortcuts. For levels that require exploration, the player may need to search for a level exit that is hidden or guarded by enemies. Such levels can also contain secrets—hidden or hard-to-reach objects or places that contain something valuable. The prize can be a bonus (see below) or a non-standard exit that allows a player to access a hidden level, or jump ahead several levels. Action games sometimes offer a teleporter that will cause the player's avatar to re-appear elsewhere in the same level. Levels often make use of locked doors that can only be opened with a specific key found elsewhere in the level.[2]
Action games sometimes make use of time restrictions to increase the challenge. However, game levels typically do not react to time passing, and day/night cycles are rare.[2] When the timer expires, the player typically loses a life, although some games generate a difficult enemy or challenge. If the level is completed with time remaining, this usually adds to the player's score.[2]
In most action games, the player controls a single avatar as the protagonist.[2] The avatar has the ability to navigate and maneuver, and often collects or manipulates objects. They have a range of defenses and attacks, such as shooting or punching. Many action games make use of a powerful attack that destroys all enemies within a limited range, but this attack is rare.[2]
Players may find a power-up within the game world that grants temporary or permanent improvements to their abilities. For example, the avatar may gain an increase in speed, more powerful attacks, or a temporary shield from attacks. Some action games even allow players to spend upgrade points on the power ups of their choice.[2]
In action games that involve navigating a space, players will encounter obstacles, traps, and enemies. Enemies typically follow fixed patterns and attack the player, although newer action games may make use of more complex artificial intelligence to pursue the player. Enemies sometimes appear in groups or waves, with enemies increasing in strength and number until the end of the level. Enemies may also appear out of thin air. This can involve an invisible spawn point, or a visible generator which can be destroyed by the player. These points may generate enemies indefinitely, or only up to a certain number.[2]
At the end of a level or group of themed levels, players often encounter a boss. This boss enemy will often resemble a larger or more difficult version of a regular enemy. A boss may require a special weapon or attack method, such as striking when the boss opens their mouth, or attacking particular part of the boss.[2]
In many action games, the avatar has a certain number of hit-markers or health, which are depleted by enemy attacks and other hazards. Sometimes health can be replenished by collecting an in-game object. When the player runs out of health, the player dies. The player's avatar is often given a small number of chances to retry after death, typically referred to as lives. Upon beginning a new life, the player resumes the game either from the same location they died, a checkpoint, or the start of the level. Upon starting a new life, the avatar is typically invincible for a few seconds to allow the player to re-orient themselves. Players may earn extra lives by reaching a certain score or by finding an in-game object. Arcade games still limit the number of player lives, while home video games have shifted increasingly to unlimited lives.[2]
Action games take place in either 2D or 3D from a variety of perspectives. 2D action games typically use a side view or top-down view. The screen frequently scrolls as the player explores the level, although many games scroll through the level automatically to push the player forward. In 3D action games, the perspective is usually tied to the avatar from a first-person perspective or third-person perspective. However, some 3D games offer a context-sensitive perspective that is controlled by an artificial intelligence camera. Most of what the player needs to know is contained within a single screen, although action games frequently make use of a heads-up display that display important information such as health or ammunition. Action games sometimes make use of maps which can be accessed during lulls in action, or a mini-map that is always visible.[2]
Action games tend to set simple goals, and reaching them is obvious.[2] A common goal is to defeat the end-of-game boss. This is often presented in the form of a structured story, with a happy ending upon winning the game. In some games, the goal changes as the player reveals more of the story.[2]
Many action games keep track of the player's score. Points are awarded for completing certain challenges, or defeating certain enemies. Skillful play is often rewarded with point multipliers, such as in Pac-Man where each ghost that the avatar eats will generate twice as many points as the last. Sometimes action games will offer bonus objects that increase the player's score. There is no penalty for failing to collect them, although these bonus objects may unlock hidden levels or special events.[2]
In many action games, achieving a high score is the only goal, and levels increase in difficulty until the player loses. Arcade games are more likely to be unbeatable, as they make their money by forcing the player to lose the game. Games sold at home are more likely to have discrete victory conditions, since a publisher wants the player to purchase another game when they are done.[2]
Action games contain several major subgenres. However, there are a number of action games that do not fit any particular subgenres, as well as other types of genres like adventure or strategy games that have action elements.[2]
Shooter games allow the player to take action at a distance using a ranged weapon, challenging them to aim with accuracy and speed. This subgenre includes first-person shooters (doom clones), third-person shooters, light gun shooters, rail shooters, run and gun games and a plethora of shoot 'em up games taking place from a top-down or side-scrolling perspective.[2] Space shooters were initially categorized as a separate genre from action games in the early 1980s, when the term was used to refer to character action games,[18][14][19] up until character-driven shooters, particularly scrolling run-and-gun shooters, became popular by the late 1980s.[14]
The setting of shooter games often involves military conflicts, whether historical, such as World War II, contemporary, such as Middle East conflicts, or fictional, such as space warfare. Shooter games do not always involve military conflicts. Other settings include hunting games, or follow the story of a criminal, as seen in the popular Grand Theft Auto franchise. Although shooting is almost always a form of violence, non-violent shooters exist as well, such as Splatoon which focuses on claiming more territory than the opposing team, by covering the playable environment with colored paint or ink.
Hybrid action games are games that combine elements of action games with elements from other genres.
Studies have shown that people can improve their eyesight by playing action video games. Tests by scientists at the University of Rochester on college students showed that over a period of a month, performance in eye examinations improved by about 20% in those playing Unreal Tournament compared to those playing Tetris.[24] Most arcade games are action games, because they can be difficult for unskilled players, and thus make more money quickly.[2]
Researchers from Helsinki School of Economics have shown that people playing a first-person shooter might secretly enjoy that their character gets killed in the game, although their expressions might show the contrary. The game used in the study was James Bond 007: Nightfire.[25]
Shooter games have been around since the beginning of the video game industry. Notable examples of shooting arcade video games during the early-to-mid-1970s include Syzygy Engineering's Computer Space (1971), Galaxy Game (1971), Tank (1974) by Kee Games, Gun Fight (1975) by Taito and Midway Manufacturing, and Midway's Sea Wolf (1976). In turn, early arcade shooter video games were inspired by early mainframe games such as Spacewar! (1962) as well as arcade electro-mechanical games such as Periscope (1965) and gun games.
A major turning point for action video games came with the 1978 release of Taito's shoot 'em up game Space Invaders,[26] which marked the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games.[27] The game was designed by Tomohiro Nishikado, who drew inspiration from Atari's Breakout (1976) and the science fiction genre. Nishikado added several interactive elements to Space Invaders that he found lacking in earlier video games, such as the ability for enemies to react to the player's movement and fire back and a game over triggered by enemies killing the player, either by getting hit or enemies reaching the bottom of the screen, rather than a timer running out.[28]
In contrast to earlier arcade games which often had a timer, Space Invaders introduced the ""concept of going round after round.""[29] It also gave the player multiple lives before the game ends,[30] and saved the high score.[31] It also had a basic story with animated characters along with a ""crescendo of action and climax"" which laid the groundwork for later video games, according to Eugene Jarvis,[32] who said many games ""still rely on the multiple life, progressively difficult level paradigm"" of Space Invaders.[33]
Following the mainstream success of Space Invaders, the industry came to be dominated by action games,[26] which have remained a dominant genre in video arcades and on game consoles through to the present day. Space Invaders set the template for later games in the shooter subgenre,[26][34] and it is considered one of the most influential games of all time.[35]
During the arcade golden age, from the late 1970s to early 1980s, a wide variety of new subgenres were created.[14] The success of Space Invaders led to space shooters becoming the dominant genre in arcades for a few years, before a new genre of character-driven action games emerged in the early 1980s.[36]
The term ""action games"" began being used in the early 1980s, in reference to a new genre of character action games that emerged from Japanese arcade developers, drawing inspiration from manga and anime culture. According to Eugene Jarvis, these new character-driven Japanese action games emphasized ""character development, hand-drawn animation and backgrounds, and a more deterministic, scripted, pattern-type"" of play. Terms such as ""action games"" or ""character games"" began being used to distinguish these new character-driven action games from the space shooters that had previously dominated the video game industry.[18][14][19] The emphasis on character-driven gameplay in turn enabled a wider variety of subgenres.[14]
Namco's hit maze game Pac-Man (1980)[37][2] popularized the genre of ""character-led"" action games.[36] It was one of the first popular non-shooting action games, defining key elements of the genre such as ""parallel visual processing"" which requires simultaneously keeping track of multiple entities, including the player character, the character's location, the enemies, and the energizers.[13] Other classic examples of character action games that followed include Nintendo's Donkey Kong (1981),[36] which established the template for the platform game subgenre,[38] as well as Konami's Frogger (1981)[18] and Universal Entertainment's Lady Bug (1981).[36] Martial arts action games eventually emerged in the mid-1980s, with Data East's Karate Champ (1984) establishing the one-on-one fighting game subgenre.[39]
While Japanese developers were creating a character-driven action game genre in the early 1980s, American developers largely adopted a different approach to game design at the time.[18] According to Eugene Jarvis, American arcade developers focused mainly on space shooters during the late 1970s to early 1980s, greatly influenced by Japanese space shooters but taking the genre in a different direction from the ""more deterministic, scripted, pattern-type"" gameplay of Japanese games, towards a more ""programmer-centric design culture, emphasizing algorithmic generation of backgrounds and enemy dispatch"" and ""an emphasis on random-event generation, particle-effect explosions and physics"" as seen in arcade games such as his own Defender (1981)[18] and Robotron: 2084 (1982)[2] as well as Atari's Asteroids (1979).[40]
In the mid-1980s, side-scrolling character action games emerged, combining elements from earlier side-view, single-screen character action games, such as single-screen platformers, with the side-scrolling of space shooters. These new side-scrolling character-driven action games featured large character sprites in colorful, side-scrolling environments, with the core gameplay consisting of fighting large groups of weaker enemies using attacks/weapons such as punches, kicks, guns, swords, ninjutsu or magic.[14]
The most notable early example was Irem's Kung-Fu Master (1984),[14] the first beat 'em up[41] and the most influential side-scrolling martial arts action game.[42] It was based upon two Hong Kong martial arts films, Bruce Lee's Game of Death (1973) and Jackie Chan's Wheels on Meals (1984),[41][43] This side-scrolling arcade action format became popular during the mid-to-late 1980s, with examples including ninja action games such as Taito's The Legend of Kage (1985) and Sega's Shinobi (1987), run and gun video games such as Namco's Rolling Thunder (1986), and beat 'em ups such as Technōs Japan's Renegade (1986) and Double Dragon (1987).[14]
Shigeru Miyamoto combined the platforming of Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. (1983) with side-scrolling elements from racing game Excitebike (1984) and beat 'em up Kung-Fu Master to create Super Mario Bros. (1985) for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).[44][45] It went on to have a significant impact on the video game industry, establishing the conventions of the side-scrolling platformer sub-genre and helping to reinvigorate the North American home video game market (after it had crashed in 1983).[14]
Alongside side-scrollers, rail shooters and light gun shooters also became popular during the mid-to-late 1980s. Popular examples include first-person light gun shooting gallery games such as Nintendo's Duck Hunt (1984), pseudo-3D third-person rail shooters such as Sega's Space Harrier (1985) and After Burner (1987), and Taito's Operation Wolf (1987) which popularized military-themed first-person light gun rail shooters.[46][47]
A trend that was popularized for action games in the early 1990s was competitive multiplayer, including what would later be known as esports tournaments. The arcade fighting game Street Fighter II (1991) by Capcom popularized the concept of direct, tournament-level competition between two players.[48] Previously, action games most often relied on high scores to determine the best player, but this changed with Street Fighter II, where players would instead challenge each other directly, ""face-to-face,"" to determine the best player,[48] paving the way for the competitive multiplayer and deathmatch modes found in modern action games.[49] Inspired by Street Fighter II, along with the SNK fighting games Fatal Fury (1991) and Art of Fighting (1992), John Romero created the deathmatch mode in id Software's Doom (1993), which popularized competitive multiplayer online games.[50]
In the 1990s, there was a ""3D Revolution"" where action games made the transition from 2D and pseudo-3D graphics to real-time 3D polygon graphics. 3D arcade system boards that were originally designed for 3D racing games during the late 1980s to early 1990s, such as the Namco System 21, Sega Model 1 and Sega Model 2, were used to produce 3D arcade action games in the early 1990s, including 3D rail shooters such as Namco's Galaxian 3 (1990) and Solvalou (1991), 3D fighting games such as Sega AM2's Virtua Fighter (1993) and Namco's Tekken (1994), and 3D light gun shooters such as Sega AM2's Virtua Cop (1994) and Namco's Time Crisis  (1995).[14]
On personal computers, the first-person shooter (FPS) genre was popularized by Doom; it is also considered, despite not using 3D polygons, a major leap forward for three-dimensional environments in action games.[51] 3D polygon texture mapping appeared in action games around the mid-1990s, introduced to fighting games by Sega AM2's Virtua Fighter 2 (1994),[52] to light gun shooters by Sega AM2's Virtua Cop in 1994,[53][54] and to FPS games by Parallax Software's Descent (1995).[55]

YouTube  is an American online video sharing platform owned by Google. YouTube was founded on February 14, 2005,[7] by Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim, and Steve Chen, who were former employees of PayPal. Headquartered in San Bruno, California, it is the second-most-visited website in the world, after Google. In January 2024, YouTube had more than 2.7 billion monthly active users, who collectively watched more than one billion hours of videos every day.[8] As of May 2019[update], videos were being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute,[9][10] and as of mid-2024[update], there were approximately 14.8 billion videos in total.[11]
On November 13, 2006, YouTube was purchased by Google for US$1.65 billion (equivalent to $2.39 billion in 2024).[12] Google expanded YouTube's business model from generating revenue through advertisements alone to offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content explicitly produced for YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube incorporated the Google AdSense program, generating more revenue for both YouTube and approved content creators. In 2023, YouTube's advertising revenue totaled $31.7 billion, a 2% increase from the $31.1 billion reported in 2022.[13] From Q4 2023 to Q3 2024, YouTube's combined revenue from advertising and subscriptions exceeded $50 billion.[14]
Since its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, news, short and feature films, songs, documentaries, movie trailers, teasers, TV spots, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media, news, and entertainment corporations have also created and expanded their visibility to YouTube channels to reach bigger audiences.
YouTube has had unprecedented social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire celebrities. Despite its growth and success, the platform has been criticized for its facilitation of the spread of misinformation and copyrighted content, routinely violating its users' privacy, excessive censorship, endangering the safety of children and their well-being, and for its inconsistent implementation of platform guidelines.
YouTube was founded by Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim, and Steve Chen. The three were early employees at PayPal and had become wealthy after eBay's acquisition of the company.[15] Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.[16]
According to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party ""was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible"".[17]
Karim said the inspiration for YouTube came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy when Janet Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the halftime show. Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami online, which led to the idea of a video-sharing site.[18][19] Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not.[17][20] They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward.[21] Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any video.[22]
YouTube began as a venture capital–funded technology startup. Between November 2005 and April 2006, the company raised money from various investors, with Sequoia Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest two.[15][23] YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California.[24] In February 2005, the company registered www.youtube.com.[25] The first video was uploaded on April 23, 2005. Titled ""Me at the zoo"", it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site.[26][27] The same day, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views.[28][29] The site exited beta in December 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day.[30][31] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.[32]
YouTube was not the first video-sharing site on the Internet; Vimeo was founded in November 2004, though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor.[33] On December 17, 2005—the same week YouTube exited beta—NBCUniversal Saturday Night Live ran a sketch ""Lazy Sunday"" by The Lonely Island. Besides helping to bolster ratings and long-term viewership for Saturday Night Live, ""Lazy Sunday""'s status as an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important website.[34] Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February 2006 before they were removed when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright concerns.[35] Despite eventually being taken down, these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube's reach and led to the upload of more third-party content.[36][37] The site grew rapidly; in July 2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.[38]
The choice of the name youtube.com led to problems for a similarly named website, utube.com. That site's owner, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment (Universal Tube), filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006, after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube. Universal Tube subsequently changed its website to www.utubeonline.com.[39][40][41]
On October 9, 2006, Google announced that they had acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock.[42][43] The deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.[44][45] Google's acquisition launched newfound interest in video-sharing sites; IAC, which now owned Vimeo, focused on supporting the content creators to distinguish itself from YouTube.[33] It was at this time that YouTube adopted the slogan ""Broadcast Yourself"".
The company experienced rapid growth. The Daily Telegraph wrote that in 2007, YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000.[46] By 2010, the company had reached a market share of around 43% and more than 14 billion views of videos, according to comScore.[47] That year, the company simplified its interface to increase the time users would spend on the site.[48]
In 2011, more than three billion videos were being watched each day with 48 hours of new videos uploaded every minute.[49][50][51] Most of these views came from a relatively small number of videos; according to a software engineer at that time, 30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site.[52] That year, the company again changed its interface and at the same time, introduced a new logo with a darker shade of red.[53][54] A subsequent interface change, designed to unify the experience across desktop, TV, and mobile, was rolled out in 2013.[55] By that point, more than 100 hours were being uploaded every minute, increasing to 300 hours by November 2014.[56][57]
During that time, the company also went through some organizational changes. In October 2006, YouTube moved to a new office in San Bruno, California.[58] Hurley announced that he would be stepping down as chief executive officer of YouTube to take an advisory role and that Salar Kamangar would take over as head of the company in October 2010.[59] In April 2009, YouTube partnered with Vevo.[60] In April 2010, Lady Gaga's ""Bad Romance"" became the most-viewed video, becoming the first video to reach 200 million views on May 9, 2010.[61]
YouTube faced a major lawsuit by Viacom International in 2011 that nearly resulted in the discontinuation of the website. The lawsuit was filed due to alleged copyright infringement of Viacom's material by YouTube. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that YouTube was not liable, and thus YouTube won the case in 2012.[62]
Susan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube in February 2014.[63] In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215 million. The complex has 51,468 square metres (554,000 square feet) of space and can house up to 2,800 employees.[64] YouTube officially launched the ""polymer"" redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design language as its default, as well as a redesigned logo that is built around the service's play button emblem in August 2017.[65]
Through this period, YouTube tried several new ways to generate revenue beyond advertisements. In 2013, YouTube launched a pilot program for content providers to offer premium, subscription-based channels.[66][67] This effort was discontinued in January 2018 and relaunched in June, with US$4.99 channel subscriptions.[68][69] These channel subscriptions complemented the existing Super Chat ability, launched in 2017, which allows viewers to donate between $1 and $500 to have their comment highlighted.[70] In 2014, YouTube announced a subscription service known as ""Music Key"", which bundled ad-free streaming of music content on YouTube with the existing Google Play Music service.[71] The service continued to evolve in 2015 when YouTube announced YouTube Red, a new premium service that would offer ad-free access to all content on the platform (succeeding the Music Key service released the previous year), premium original series, and films produced by YouTube personalities, as well as background playback of content on mobile devices. YouTube also released YouTube Music, a third app oriented towards streaming and discovering the music content hosted on the YouTube platform.[72][73][74]
The company also attempted to create products appealing to specific viewers. YouTube released a mobile app known as YouTube Kids in 2015, which was designed to provide an experience optimized for children. It features a simplified user interface, curated selections of channels featuring age-appropriate content, and parental control features.[75] Also in 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming—a video gaming-oriented vertical and app for videos and live streaming, intended to compete with the Amazon.com-owned Twitch.[76] In April 2018, a shooting occurred at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California, which wounded four and resulted in the death of the shooter.[77]
By February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube videos were being watched every day, and 400 hours worth of videos were uploaded every minute.[8][78] Two years later, the uploads had risen to more than 500 hours per minute.[9] During the COVID-19 pandemic, when most of the world was under stay-at-home orders, usage of services like YouTube significantly increased. Forbes estimated that YouTube accounted for 16% of all internet traffic, as of 2024[update], up from 11% in 2018, before the pandemic.[79][80] In response to EU officials requesting that such services reduce bandwidth to make sure medical entities had sufficient bandwidth to share information, YouTube and Netflix said they would reduce streaming quality for at least thirty days as to cut bandwidth use of their services by 25% to comply with the EU's request.[81] YouTube later announced that they would continue with this move worldwide: ""We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation.""[82]
After a 2018 complaint alleging violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),[83] the company was fined $170 million by the FTC for collecting personal information from minors under the age of 13.[84] YouTube was also ordered to create systems to increase children's privacy.[85][86] Following criticisms of its implementation of those systems, YouTube started treating all videos designated as ""made for kids"" as liable under COPPA on January 6, 2020.[87][88] Joining the YouTube Kids app, the company created a supervised mode, designed more for tweens, in 2021.[89] Additionally, to compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels, YouTube released YouTube Shorts, a short-form video platform.[90] During that period, YouTube entered disputes with other tech companies. For over a year, in 2018–19, no YouTube app was available for Amazon Fire products.[91] In 2020, Roku removed the YouTube TV app from its streaming store after the two companies were unable to reach an agreement.[92]
After testing earlier in 2021, YouTube removed public display of dislike counts on videos in November 2021, claiming the reason for the removal was, based on its internal research, that users often used the dislike feature as a form of cyberbullying and brigading.[93] While some users praised the move as a way to discourage trolls, others felt that hiding dislikes would make it harder for viewers to recognize clickbait or unhelpful videos and that other features already existed for creators to limit bullying. YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim referred to the update as ""a stupid idea"", and said that the real reason behind the change was ""not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed."" He felt that users' ability on a social platform to identify harmful content was essential, saying, ""The process works, and there's a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines.""[94][95][96] Shortly after the announcement, software developer Dmitry Selivanov created Return YouTube Dislike, an open-source, third-party browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows users to see a video's number of dislikes.[97] In a letter published on January 25, 2022, by then YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, acknowledged that removing public dislike counts was a controversial decision, but reiterated that she stands by this decision, claiming that ""it reduced dislike attacks.""[98]
In 2022, YouTube launched an experiment where the company would show users who watched longer videos on TVs a long chain of short unskippable adverts, intending to consolidate all ads into the beginning of a video. Following public outrage over the unprecedented amount of unskippable ads, YouTube ""ended"" the experiment on September 19 of the same year.[99] In October, YouTube announced that they would be rolling out customizable user handles in addition to channel names, which would also become channel URLs.[100]
On February 16, 2023, Wojcicki announced that she would step down as CEO, with Neal Mohan named as her successor. Wojcicki took on an advisory role for Google and parent company Alphabet.[101] Wojcicki died a year and a half later from non-small-cell lung cancer, on August 9, 2024.[102] In late October 2023, YouTube began cracking down on the use of ad blockers on the platform. Users of ad blockers may be given a pop-up warning saying ""Video player will be blocked after 3 videos"". Users of ad blockers are shown a message asking them to allow ads or inviting them to subscribe to the ad-free YouTube Premium subscription plan. YouTube says that the use of ad blockers violates its terms of service.[103][104] In April 2024, YouTube announced it would be ""strengthening our enforcement on third-party apps that violate YouTube's Terms of Service, specifically ad-blocking apps"".[105] Starting in June 2024, Google Chrome announced that it would be replacing Manifest V2 in favor of Manifest V3, effectively killing support for most ad-blockers.[106] Around the same time, YouTube started using server-side ad injection, which allows the platform to inject the ads directly into the video, instead of having the ad as a separate file which can be blocked.[107]
In September 2023, YouTube announced an in-app gaming platform called Playables. It was made accessible to all users in May 2024, expanding from an initial offering limited to premium subscribers. In December 2024, YouTube began testing a new multiplayer feature for that service, supporting multiplayer functionality across desktop and mobile devices. As of December 2024[update] the Playables catalog has over 130 games in various genres, including trivia, action and sports.[108][109] In December 2024, YouTube introduced new guidelines prohibiting videos with clickbait titles to enhance content quality and combat misinformation. The platform aims to penalize creators using misleading or sensationalized titles, with potential actions including video removal or channel suspension.[110] According to YouTube, this guideline will gradually roll out in India first, but will expand to more countries in the coming months.[111]
On February 14, 2025, YouTube celebrated 20 years since its founding.[112] On July 30, 2025, amid the implementation of the Online Safety Act 2023 in the United Kingdom, Google announced that it would begin to enforce ""age assurance"" policies for selected users in the United States as a trial. Machine learning will be used to determine the age of the user (regardless of any account information indicating their age) and restrict access to certain content and features across all Google properties, including YouTube (including, in particular, disabling personalized advertising and enabling certain digital wellbeing limits), if they are assumed to be under 18. On YouTube, this will be based on factors such as searches and video history, and the age of the account. The user must go through age verification via payment, scanned ID, or selfie to access all features if they are detected to be a minor.[113][114] On April 9, 2025, YouTube expressed support for the NO FAKES Act of 2025, introduced by Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) and Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and announced an expansion of its pilot program that is designed to identify content generated by AI.[115]
On September 23, 2025, YouTube parent company Alphabet announced that it would reinstate creators that were banned for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[116] Within the context of the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel and debates about free speech in the United States, Vice President JD Vance defended Kimmel's suspension and instead cited a letter sent by Alphabet legal counsel Daniel F. Donovan to U.S. House Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan, claiming the Biden administration pressured YouTube to remove ""non-violative user-generated content"" containing misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, and announced that it would reinstate content creators previously banned due to the cited content;[117][118] however, such claims have not formally been proven, and the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed in 2024 the First Amendment case Murthy v. Missouri (which claimed the Biden administration had pressured social media companies to censor conservative views, government criticism, and COVID-19 misinformation), ruling 6–3 that neither the attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana nor other respondents had standing to bring the case. The decision of Alphabet to bring back YouTube creators who engaged in misinformation was criticized for prioritizing ""free expression"" over ""facts"".[119]
YouTube has been led by a CEO since its founding in 2005, beginning with Chad Hurley, who led the company until 2010. After Google's acquisition of YouTube, the CEO role was retained. Salar Kamangar took over Hurley's position and kept the job until 2014. He was replaced by Susan Wojcicki, who later resigned in 2023.[101] On February 16, 2023, Neal Mohan was appointed as the new CEO.[101]
YouTube offers different features based on user verification, such as standard or basic features like uploading videos, creating playlists, and using YouTube Music, with limits based on daily activity (verification via phone number or channel history increases feature availability and daily usage limits); intermediate or additional features like longer videos (over 15 minutes), live streaming, custom thumbnails, and creating podcasts; advanced features like content ID appeals, embedding live streams, applying for monetization, clickable links, adding chapters, and pinning comments on videos or posts.[120]
In January 2012, it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site, in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical US citizen watching television.[121] In 2017, viewers on average watched YouTube on mobile devices for more than an hour every day.[122] In December 2012, two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube, prompting a claim by The Daily Dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site's terms of service, which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts. That was disputed by Billboard, which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo, since the videos were no longer active on YouTube.[123][124]
On August 5, 2015, YouTube patched the formerly notorious behavior which caused a video's view count to freeze at ""301"" (later ""301+"") until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud.[125] YouTube view counts again began updating in real time.[126] Since September 2019, subscriber counts are abbreviated. Only three leading digits of channels' subscriber counts are indicated publicly, compromising the function of third-party real-time indicators such as Social Blade. Exact counts remain available to channel operators inside YouTube Studio.[127]
On November 11, 2021, after testing out this change in March of the same year, YouTube announced it would start hiding dislike counts on videos, making them invisible to viewers. The company stated the decision was in response to experiments which confirmed that smaller YouTube creators were more likely to be targeted in dislike brigading and harassment. Creators will still be able to see the number of likes and dislikes in the YouTube Studio dashboard tool, according to YouTube.[128][129][130] YouTube has an estimated 14.8 billion videos with about 4% of those never having a view.[11] Just over 85% have fewer than 1,000 views.[131]
YouTube has faced numerous challenges and criticisms in its attempts to deal with copyright, including the site's first viral video, Lazy Sunday, which had to be taken down, due to copyright concerns.[132] At the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws.[133] Despite this advice, many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube. YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act. Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike. Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted.[134][135] From 2007 to 2009 organizations including Viacom, Mediaset, and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material.[136][137][138]
In August 2008, a US court ruled in Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material.[139] YouTube's owner Google announced in November 2015 that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use defenses apply.[140] In the 2011 case of Smith v. Summit Entertainment LLC, professional singer Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on YouTube.[141] He asserted seven causes of action, and four were ruled in Smith's favor.[142] In April 2012, a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users.[143] On November 1, 2016, the dispute with GEMA was resolved, with Google content ID being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos with content protected by GEMA.[144]
In April 2013, it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA counter-notice.[145][146] As part of YouTube Music, Universal and YouTube signed an agreement in 2017, which was followed by separate agreements other major labels, which gave the company the right to advertising revenue when its music was played on YouTube.[147] By 2019, creators were having videos taken down or demonetized when Content ID identified even short segments of copyrighted music within a much longer video, with different levels of enforcement depending on the record label.[148] Experts noted that some of these clips said qualified for fair use.[148]
In June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute.[149] The system, which was initially called ""Video Identification""[150][151] and later became known as Content ID,[152] creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found.[153] When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video.[citation needed]
An independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube and concluded that while the system was ""surprisingly resilient"" in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible.[154] The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use.[155] If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.[156] Before 2016, videos were not monetized until the dispute was resolved. Since April 2016, videos continue to be monetized while the dispute is in progress, and the money goes to whoever won the dispute.[157] Should the uploader want to monetize the video again, they may remove the disputed audio in the ""Video Manager"".[158] YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length.[159]
In 2021, two accounts linked to RT DE, the German channel of the Russian state-owned RT network, were removed for breaching YouTube's policies relating to COVID-19.[160] Russia threatened to ban YouTube after the platform deleted two German RT channels in September 2021.[161] Shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, YouTube removed all channels funded by the Russian state.[162] YouTube expanded the removal of Russian content from its site to include channels described as 'pro-Russian'. In June 2022, the War Gonzo channel run by Russian military blogger and journalist Semyon Pegov was deleted.[163]
In July 2023, YouTube removed the channel of British journalist Graham Phillips, active in covering the war in Donbas from 2014.[164] In August 2023, a Moscow court fined Google 3 million rubles, around $35,000, for not deleting what it said was ""fake news about the war in Ukraine"".[165] In October 2024, a Russian court fined Google 2 undecillion rubles (equivalent to US$20 decillion) for restricting Russian state media channels on YouTube.[166] State news agency TASS reported that Google is allowed to return to the Russian market only if it complies with the court's decision.[167] Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov labeled the court decision as ""symbolic"" and warned Google that it ""should not be restricting the actions of our broadcasters on its platform.""[168]
YouTube featured an April Fools prank on the site on April 1 of every year from 2008 to 2016. In 2008, all links to videos on the main page were redirected to Rick Astley's music video ""Never Gonna Give You Up"", a prank known as ""rickrolling"".[169][170] The next year, when clicking on a video on the main page, the whole page turned upside down, which YouTube claimed was a ""new layout"".[171] In 2010, YouTube temporarily released a ""TEXTp"" mode which rendered video imagery into ASCII art letters ""in order to reduce bandwidth costs by $1 per second.""[172]
The next year, the site celebrated its ""100th anniversary"" with a range of sepia-toned silent, early 1900s-style films, including a parody of Keyboard Cat.[173] In 2012, clicking on the image of a DVD next to the site logo led to a video about a purported option to order every YouTube video for home delivery on DVD.[174] In 2013, YouTube teamed up with satirical newspaper company The Onion to claim in an uploaded video that the video-sharing website was launched as a contest which had finally come to an end, and would shut down for ten years before being re-launched in 2023, featuring only the winning video. The video starred several YouTube celebrities, including Antoine Dodson. A video of two presenters announcing the nominated videos streamed live for 12 hours.[175][176]
In 2014, YouTube announced that it was responsible for the creation of all viral video trends, and revealed previews of upcoming trends, such as ""Clocking"", ""Kissing Dad"", and ""Glub Glub Water Dance"".[177] The next year, YouTube added a music button to the video bar that played samples from ""Sandstorm"" by Darude.[178] In 2016, YouTube introduced an option to watch every video on the platform in 360-degree mode with Snoop Dogg.[179]
YouTube Premium (formerly Music Key and YouTube Red) is YouTube's premium subscription service. It offers advertising-free streaming, access to original programming, and background and offline video playback on mobile devices.[180] YouTube Premium was originally announced on November 12, 2014, as ""Music Key"", a subscription music streaming service, and was intended to integrate with and replace the existing Google Play Music ""All Access"" service.[181][182][183] On October 28, 2015, the service was relaunched as YouTube Red, offering ad-free streaming of all videos and access to exclusive original content.[184][185][186] As of November 2016[update], the service has 1.5 million subscribers, with a further million on a free-trial basis.[187] As of June 2017[update], the first season of YouTube Originals had received 250 million views in total.[188]
YouTube Kids is an American children's video app developed by YouTube, a subsidiary of Google. The app was developed in response to parental and government scrutiny on the content available to children.[citation needed] The app provides a version of the service oriented towards children, with curated selections of content, parental control features, and filtering of videos deemed inappropriate viewing for children aged under 13, 8 or 5, depending on the age grouping chosen. First released on February 15, 2015, as an Android and iOS mobile app, the app has since been released for LG, Samsung, and Sony smart TVs, as well as for Android TV. On May 27, 2020, it became available on Apple TV. As of September 2019, the app is available in 69 countries, including Hong Kong and Macau, and one province. YouTube launched a web-based version of YouTube Kids on August 30, 2019.[189]
On September 28, 2016, YouTube named Lyor Cohen, the co-founder of 300 Entertainment and former Warner Music Group executive, the Global Head of Music.[190] In early 2018, Cohen began hinting at the possible launch of YouTube's new subscription music streaming service, a platform that would compete with other services such as Spotify and Apple Music.[191] On May 22, 2018, the music streaming platform named ""YouTube Music"" was launched for people who mostly listen to music on YouTube.[192][193][194]
YouTube Movies & TV is a video on demand (VOD) service that offers movies and television shows for purchase or rental, depending on availability, along with a selection of movies (encompassing between 100 and 500 titles overall) that are free to stream, with interspersed ad breaks. YouTube began offering free-to-view movie titles to its users in November 2018; selections of new movies are added and others removed, unannounced each month.[195] In March 2021, Google announced plans to gradually deprecate the Google Play Movies & TV app, and eventually migrate all users to the YouTube app's Movies & TV store to view, rent and purchase movies and TV shows (first affecting Roku, Samsung, LG, and Vizio smart TV users on July 15).[196][197] Google Play Movies & TV formally shut down on January 17, 2024, with the web version of that platform migrated to YouTube as an expansion of the Movies & TV store to desktop users. Other functions of Google Play Movies & TV were integrated into the Google TV service.[198]
On November 1, 2022, YouTube launched Primetime Channels, a channel store platform offering third-party subscription streaming add-ons sold a la carte through the YouTube website and app, competing with similar subscription add-on stores operated by Apple, Prime Video and Roku. The add-ons can be purchased through the YouTube Movies & TV hub or through the official YouTube channels of the available services; subscribers of YouTube TV add-ons that are sold through Primetime Channels can also access their content via the YouTube app and website. A total of 34 streaming services (including Paramount+, Showtime, Starz, MGM+, AMC+ and ViX+) were initially available for purchase.[199][200]
NFL Sunday Ticket, as part of a broader residential distribution deal with Google signed in December 2022 that also made it available to YouTube TV subscribers, was added to Primetime Channels as a standalone add-on on August 16, 2023.[201][202] The ad-free tier of Max was added to Primetime Channels on December 12, 2023, coinciding with YouTube TV converting its separate HBO (for base plan subscribers) and HBO Max (for all subscribers) linear/VOD add-ons into a single combined Max offering.[203][204][note 1]
On February 28, 2017, in a press announcement held at YouTube Space Los Angeles, YouTube announced YouTube TV, an over-the-top MVPD-style subscription service that would be available for United States customers at a price of US$65 per month. Initially launching in five major markets (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco) on April 5, 2017,[205][206] the service offers live streams of programming from the five major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox and NBC, along with selected MyNetworkTV affiliates and independent stations in certain markets), as well as approximately 60 cable channels owned by companies such as The Walt Disney Company, Paramount Global, Fox Corporation, NBCUniversal, Allen Media Group and Warner Bros. Discovery (including among others Bravo, USA Network, Syfy, Disney Channel, CNN, Cartoon Network, E!, Fox Sports 1, Freeform, FX and ESPN).[207][208]
Subscribers can receive premium cable channels (including HBO (via a combined Max add-on that includes in-app and log-in access to the service), Cinemax, Showtime, Starz and MGM+) and other subscription services (such as NFL Sunday Ticket, MLB.tv, NBA League Pass, Curiosity Stream and Fox Nation) as optional add-ons for an extra fee, and can access YouTube Premium original content.[207][208] In September 2022, YouTube TV began allowing customers to purchase most of its premium add-ons (excluding certain services such as NBA League Pass and AMC+) without an existing subscription to its base package.[209]
In September 2016, YouTube Go was announced,[210] as an Android app created for making YouTube easier to access on mobile devices in emerging markets. It was distinct from the company's main Android app and allowed videos to be downloaded and shared with other users. It also allowed users to preview videos, share downloaded videos through Bluetooth, and offered more options for mobile data control and video resolution.[211]
In February 2017, YouTube Go was launched in India, and expanded in November 2017 to 14 other countries, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Kenya, and South Africa.[212][213] On February 1, 2018, it was rolled out in 130 countries worldwide, including Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, and Iraq. Before it shut down, the app was available to around 60% of the world's population.[214][215] In May 2022, Google announced that they would be shutting down YouTube Go in August 2022.[216]
In September 2020, YouTube announced that it would be launching a beta version of a new platform of 15-second videos, similar to TikTok, called YouTube Shorts.[217][218] The platform was first tested in India and later expanded to other countries, including the United States in March 2021, with videos now able to be up to 1 minute long.[219] The platform is not a standalone app, but is integrated into the main YouTube app. Like TikTok, it gives users access to built-in creative tools, including the possibility of adding licensed music to their videos.[220] The platform had its global beta launch on July 13, 2021.[221]
In 2018, YouTube started testing a new feature initially called ""YouTube Reels"".[222] The feature was nearly identical to Instagram Stories and Snapchat Stories. YouTube later renamed the feature ""YouTube Stories"". It was only available to creators who had more than 10,000 subscribers and could only be posted/seen in the YouTube mobile app.[223] On May 25, 2023, YouTube announced that they would be shutting down this feature on June 26, 2023.[224][225]
In November 2016, YouTube released YouTube VR, a dedicated version with an interface for VR devices, for Google's Daydream mobile VR platform on Android.[226] In November 2018, YouTube VR was released on the Oculus Store for the Oculus Go headset.[226] YouTube VR was updated since for compatibility with successive Quest devices, and was ported to Pico 4.[227]
YouTube VR allows for access to all YouTube-hosted videos, but particularly supports headset access for 360° and 180°-degree video (both in 2D and stereoscopic 3D). Starting with the Oculus Quest, the app was updated for compatibility with mixed-reality passthrough modes on VR headsets. In April 2024, YouTube VR was updated to support 8K SDR video on Meta Quest 3.[228]
In 2010, YouTube added Snake as a hidden game inside of their video player.[229] In May 2024, YouTube introduced Playables, a set of around 75 free-to-play games that can be played on the platform.[230]
In December 2024, YouTube added the functionality of automatic language dubbing, which uses AI to produce translations of videos into different languages.[231][232][233][234]
YouTube, a video sharing platform, has faced various criticisms over the years, particularly regarding content moderation, offensive content, and monetization. YouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its operations,[235] its recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote conspiracy theories and falsehoods,[236] hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing violent or sexually suggestive content involving popular characters,[237] videos of minors attracting pedophilic activities in their comment sections,[238] and fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with advertising.[235]
Since its founding in 2005, the American video-sharing website YouTube has been faced with a growing number of privacy issues, including allegations that it allows users to upload unauthorized copyrighted material and allows personal information from young children to be collected without their parents' consent.
YouTube has been censored, filtered, or banned for a variety of reasons, including:[245]
Access to specific videos is sometimes prevented due to copyright and intellectual property protection laws (e.g. in Germany), violations of hate speech, and preventing access to videos judged inappropriate for youth,[246] which is also done by YouTube with the YouTube Kids app and with ""restricted mode"".[247] Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to its bandwidth limitations[248][249] and the site's potential for distraction.[245][250]
As of 2018[update], public access to YouTube is blocked in many countries, including China, North Korea, Iran, Turkmenistan,[251] Uzbekistan,[252][253] Tajikistan, Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan. In some countries, YouTube is blocked for more limited periods of time, such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service.[245]
Reports emerged that since October 2019, comments posted with Chinese characters insulting the Chinese Communist Party (共匪 ""communist bandit"" or 五毛 ""50 Cent Party"", referring to state-sponsored commentators) were being automatically deleted within 15 seconds.[254] Specific incidents where YouTube has been blocked include:
Private individuals,[287] as well as large production corporations,[288] have used YouTube to grow their audiences. Indie creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort, while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic.[287] Concurrently, old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television.[288] While YouTube's revenue-sharing ""Partner Program"" made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually[289] and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $2.5 million to $12 million[290]—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as ""a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels.""[291] In 2013, Katheryn Thayer of Forbes asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media.[292] Videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as ""mega"", ""mainstream"" and ""mid-sized"" received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo in that year.[293] By early 2013, Billboard had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the Billboard Hot 100 and related genre charts.[294]
Observing that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been ""fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution"", TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that ""what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for face-to-face communication.""[295] Anderson asserted that it is not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance, and that video contributors may be about to launch ""the biggest learning cycle in human history.""[295] In education, for example, the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan's cousin into what Forbes' Michael Noer called ""the largest school in the world"", with technology poised to disrupt how people learn.[296] YouTube was awarded a 2008 George Foster Peabody Award,[297] the website being described as a Speakers' Corner that ""both embodies and promotes democracy.""[298] The Washington Post reported that a disproportionate share of YouTube's most-subscribed channels feature minorities, contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely white.[299] A Pew Research Center study reported the development of ""visual journalism"", in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation.[300] The study also concluded that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people acquire news.[301]
YouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government, such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates (2007) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video, with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape.[302] Describing the Arab Spring (2010–2012), sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using ""Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world.""[303] In 2012, more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the ""Kony 2012"" video was posted to YouTube, with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video ""will do more to lead to (Kony's) demise than all other action combined.""[304]
Conversely, YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens, the White House's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012[307] and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)-compliant health insurance.[308] In February 2014, U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators not only to promote awareness of Obamacare[309] but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the ""YouTube Generation"".[305] Whereas YouTube's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted, the YouTube content creators' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website's distracting content and fickle audience.[305]
Some YouTube videos have themselves had a direct effect on world events, such as Innocence of Muslims (2012) which spurred protests and related anti-American violence internationally.[310] TED curator Chris Anderson described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field share their independently developed skills in YouTube videos, thus challenging others to improve their own skills, and spurring invention and evolution in that field.[295] Journalist Virginia Heffernan stated in The New York Times that such videos have ""surprising implications"" for the dissemination of culture and even the future of classical music.[311]
A 2017 article in The New York Times Magazine posited that YouTube had become ""the new talk radio"" for the far right.[312] Almost a year before YouTube's January 2019 announcement that it would begin a ""gradual change"" of ""reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways"",[313] Zeynep Tufekci had written in The New York Times that, ""(g)iven its billion or so users, YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century"".[314] Under YouTube's changes to its recommendation engine, the most-recommended channel evolved from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones (2016) to Fox News (2019).[315] According to a 2020 study, viewership of far-right videos on YouTube peaked in 2017 and ""a growing body of journalistic evidence"" suggested that YouTube was radicalizing young men through its recommendation engine, but that such evidence was ""fraught with a bias towards sensationalism"". It also found more ""mainstream-adjacent Conservative creators"" gaining over alt-right and extremist videos by 2020.[316] A 2022 study found that ""despite widespread concerns that YouTube's algorithms send people down 'rabbit holes' with recommendations to extremist videos, little systematic evidence exists to support this conjecture"", and that such exposure was ""heavily concentrated among a small group of people with high prior levels of gender and racial resentment.""[317] A 2024 study by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue found that YouTube frequently recommended Christian videos and right-leaning and culturally conservative ""culture war"" videos by Fox News and male lifestyle influencers to accounts that did not show an interest in such topics.[318]
The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers[319] and the YouTube Symphony Orchestra[320] selected their membership based on individual video performances.[295][320] Further, the cyber-collaboration charity video ""We Are the World 25 for Haiti (YouTube edition)"" was formed by mixing performances of 57 globally distributed singers into a single musical work,[321] with The Tokyo Times noting the ""We Pray for You"" YouTube cyber-collaboration video as an example of a trend to use crowdsourcing for charitable purposes.[322]
The anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens,[323] that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama, Vice President Biden, White House staff, and several cabinet secretaries.[324] Similarly, in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd's video ""My story: Struggling, bullying, suicide, self-harm"", legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy.[325] In May 2018, after London Metropolitan Police claimed that drill music videos glamorizing violence gave rise to gang violence, YouTube deleted 30 videos.[326]
Prior to 2020, Google did not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as ""not material"" in a regulatory filing.[327] In June 2008, a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales.[328] In 2012, YouTube's revenue from its ads program was estimated at $3.7 billion.[329] In 2013, it nearly doubled and estimated to hit $5.6 billion according to e-Marketer,[329][330] while others estimated $4.7 billion.[329] The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by advertising.[66] In May 2013, YouTube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices ranging from $0.99 to $6.99 a month.[331] The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online subscription services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.[66]
Google first published exact revenue numbers for YouTube in February 2020 as part of Alphabet's 2019 financial report. According to Google, YouTube had made US$15.1 billion in ad revenue in 2019, in contrast to US$8.1 billion in 2017 and US$11.1 billion in 2018. YouTube's revenues made up nearly 10% of the total Alphabet revenue in 2019.[332][333] These revenues accounted for approximately 20 million subscribers combined between YouTube Premium and YouTube Music subscriptions, and 2 million subscribers to YouTube TV.[334] YouTube had $29.2 billion ads revenue in 2022, up by $398 million from the prior year.[335] In Q2 2024, ad revenue rose to $8.66 billion, up 13% on Q1.[336]
YouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006.[337] In March 2007, it struck a deal with the BBC for three channels with BBC content, one for news and two for entertainment.[338] In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for U.S. viewers called ""Shows"". The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney.[339][340] In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of ""Shows"" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners.[341] In January 2010, YouTube introduced a film rentals service,[342] available in many countries, and TV shows can be bought in several countries.[343][344] The service offers over 6,000 films.[345]
In March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube, after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content. The government demanded assurances that its advertising would ""be delivered safely and appropriately"". The Guardian newspaper, as well as other major British and U.S. brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content. Google stated that it had ""begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear"".[346][347]
In early April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a Wall Street Journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader. The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video.[348][349] On April 6, 2017, YouTube announced that to ""ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules"", it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review, and have at least 10,000-lifetime views, before they may join the YouTube Partner Program.[350]
In May 2007, YouTube launched its Partner Program (YPP), a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site.[351] YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader.[352][353] There are over two million members of the YouTube Partner Program.[354] According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually, no more than half of the eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, due to a lack of interested advertisers.[355]
YouTube's policies restrict certain forms of content from being included in videos being monetized with advertising, including videos containing violence, strong language, sexual content, ""controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown"" (unless the content is ""usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain""),[356] and videos whose user comments contain ""inappropriate"" content.[357]
In 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription for viewers to watch videos.[358][359] In April 2017, YouTube set an eligibility requirement of 10,000 lifetime views for a paid subscription.[360] On January 16, 2018, the eligibility requirement for monetization was changed to 4,000 hours of watch-time within the past 12 months and 1,000 subscribers.[360] The move was seen as an attempt to ensure that videos being monetized did not lead to controversy, but was criticized for penalizing smaller YouTube channels.[361] YouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels.[362] The trophies made of nickel plated copper-nickel alloy, golden plated brass, silver plated metal, ruby, and red tinted crystal glass are given to channels with at least one hundred thousand, a million, ten million, fifty million subscribers, and one hundred million subscribers, respectively.[363][364]
YouTube's policies on ""advertiser-friendly content"" restrict what may be incorporated into videos being monetized; this includes strong violence, language,[365] sexual content, and ""controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown"", unless the content is ""usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain"".[366] In September 2016, after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations, YouTube's policies were criticized by prominent users, including Philip DeFranco and Vlogbrothers. DeFranco argued that not being able to earn advertising revenue on such videos was ""censorship by a different name"". A YouTube spokesperson stated that while the policy itself was not new, the service had ""improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators"".[367][368][369] Boing Boing reported in 2019 that LGBT keywords resulted in demonetization.[370] In the United States as of November 2020, and June 2021 worldwide,[371] YouTube reserves the right to monetize any video on the platform, even if their uploader is not a member of the YouTube Partner Program. This will occur on channels whose content is deemed ""advertiser-friendly"", and all revenue will go directly to Google without any share given to the uploader.[372]
The majority of YouTube's advertising revenue goes to the publishers and video producers who hold the rights to their videos; the company retains 45% of the ad revenue.[373] In 2010, it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders. YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue.[374] In May 2013, Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games.[375] In February 2015, Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators through the Nintendo Creators Program.[376][377][378] On March 20, 2019, Nintendo announced on Twitter that the company will end the Creators program. Operations for the program ceased on March 20, 2019.[379][380]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(video_games),Life (video games),"In video games, a life is a play-turn that a player character has, defined as the period between start and end of play.[1] Lives refer to a finite number of tries before the game ends with a game over.[2] Sometimes the euphemisms chance, try, rest and continue are used, particularly in all-ages games, to avoid the morbid insinuation of losing one's ""life"".[3] Generally, if the player loses all their health, they lose a life. Losing all lives usually grants the player character ""game over"", forcing them to either restart or stop playing.
The number of lives a player is granted varies per game type. A finite number of lives became a common feature in arcade games and action games during the 1980s, and mechanics such as checkpoints and power-ups made the managing of lives a more strategic experience for players over time. Lives give novice players more chances to learn the mechanics of a video game, while allowing more advanced players to take more risks.
Lives may have originated from the pinball mechanic of having a limited number of balls. A finite number of lives (usually three) became a common feature in arcade games. The number of lives usually displayed on the screen (in arcade games, the character that is being played, is also counted as a ""life"").  Much like in pinball games, the player's goal was usually to score as many points as possible with their limited number of lives.[2][4] Taito's classic arcade video game Space Invaders (1978) is usually credited with introducing multiple lives to video games.[5] Lives were important in these games because the desire to avoid the finality of the player character's death compelled players to insert more quarters, making the maximum amount of profit.[6]
Later, refinements of health, defense and other attributes, as well as power-ups, made managing the player character's life a more strategic experience and made lost health less of the handicap it was in early arcade games.[4] Lives and game over screens became thought of as outmoded concepts and holdovers from arcade games that were unnecessary when players had already paid for the game. They also discouraged the player from playing the game fairly, with players in games such as Doom resorting to save scumming in order to preserve their lives rather than start from an in-game checkpoint with their lives depleted, and getting a game over can often cause players to permanently abandon a game instead of making another attempt at the level. Therefore, most modern games have completely abandoned the concept of player lives, instead simply restarting the player from the nearest checkpoint when they die, allowing them to undo or rewind their progress until such time as they are safe, as in Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, or making saving the player from death contingent on successfully executing a QTE, as in Batman: Arkham Asylum.[6]
It is common in action games for the player to have multiple lives and chances to earn more in-game. This way, a player can recover from making a disastrous mistake. Role-playing games and adventure games usually grant only one, but allow player-characters to reload a saved game.[7][8]
Lives set up the situation where dying is not necessarily the end of the game, allowing the player to take risks they might not take otherwise, or experiment with different strategies to find one that works. Multiple lives also allow novice players a chance to learn a game's mechanics before the game is over. Another reason to implement lives is that the ability to earn extra lives provide an additional reward incentive for the player.[2]
The way lives are shown varies from game to game.  While pinball games often use an increasing counter (""Ball 1"", ""Ball 2"", ""Ball 3""), most other types of games with a lives system display a number of lives remaining.  A particular variation is in whether the displayed number of lives includes the one currently being used, hence whether the game ends immediately when the life counter reaches zero or the player still has one chance left.
Many older video games feature cheat codes that allow the player to gain extra lives without earning them throughout gameplay. One example is Contra, which added the option to input the Konami code to get 30 extra lives.[9]
In modern times, some free-to-play games, such as the Candy Crush Saga trilogy, capitalize on the multiple life system to create an opportunity to earn more microtransactions.  In such games, a life is lost when the player fails a level, but once all lives are lost, the player is prevented from continuing the game for a temporary amount of time, instead of receiving a game over that would entail total failure or require a new beginning, as lives will re-generate automatically after a number of minutes or hours.  Players can either wait for lives, attempt alternate activities to recover lives (such as asking for friends online to donate lives), or purchase items that can fully replenish lives or grant unlimited lives for a limited time to continue playing immediately.[citation needed] This system works like an ""energy"" meter for other free-to-play games, however, lives do not deplete when a level is successfully completed, unlike energy.
An extra life or a 1-up is a video game item that increments the player character's number of lives.[10] Because there are no universal game rules, the form 1-ups take varies from game to game, but are often rare and difficult items to acquire. The use of the term ""1-up"" to designate an extra life first appeared in Super Mario Bros., where a 1-Up could be obtained in several ways, including grabbing a green ""1-Up Mushroom"", collecting 100 coins, using a Koopa shell to kill eight or more consecutive enemies, and jumping on eight or more consecutive enemies without touching the ground.  The term quickly caught on, seeing use in both home and arcade video games.[1]
A number of games included an exploitable design flaw called a ""1-up loop"", in which it is possible to consistently acquire two or more 1-ups between a certain checkpoint and the following checkpoint. The player can thus acquire two 1-ups, make the character die, and restart from the first checkpoint with a net gain of one life; this procedure can then be repeated for as many lives as the player desires.[11]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekiryo_Kaneda,Sekiryo Kaneda,"
Sekiryo Kaneda (Japanese: 金田 積良, Hepburn: Kaneda Sekiryō; 1883 – 1949), also known as Sekiryo Yamauchi (山内 積良, Yamauchi Sekiryō), was the second president of what is now Nintendo Co., Ltd., from 1929 to 1949. He married one of the two daughters of Fusajiro Yamauchi, Tei Yamauchi, and took the Yamauchi surname.[1][2] Kaneda retired in 1949 after suffering a stroke, leaving Nintendo to be run by his grandson, Hiroshi Yamauchi.[3]
In 1905, Kaneda married Fusajiro Yamauchi's daughter, Tei, and based on Japanese adult adoption rules, he took the Yamauchi surname on the same day in order to inherit Nintendo.[4] Fusajiro Yamauchi died[5] or retired in 1929, making Kaneda Nintendo's second president.[6]
When Kaneda took over Nintendo, he was in charge of Japan's largest card maker.[6] One of his first decisions was to create a ""karuta"" division in charge of all educative and child-focused card games.[5]
In 1933, he established Nintendo as a joint venture company called Yamauchi Nintendo.[4][5] He additionally imposed new works methods and expanded Nintendo international market by selling cheap decks in India and by selling hanafuda decks to Japanese colonists throughout the Japanese colonial empire.[5] Additionally, hanafuda decks are sold to Japanese migrants in the United States during this period. Indeed, hanafuda decks made by Nintendo have been found in the United States dating from 1930s.[5]
The same year, Kaneda expanded Nintendo's headquarters by buying the nearby terrain and building a new building made of cement using his own company, Haikyô.[7]
During World War II, Nintendo came close to bankruptcy but was saved thanks to a contract with the Japanese government on November 28th 1942 to realise a Uta-garuta deck which used nationalist texts instead of the habitual 100 poems. 15,000 decks were made by December 8th. Nintendo also sold board games with nationalist connotations during this period.[8]
In 1947, he established a distribution company, Marufuku, that would sell new varieties of Western-style playing cards.[4][2]
From his 1905 marriage to Tei Yamauchi,[5] Kaneda had two daughters: Kimi, born in 1907, whose husband would end up inheriting Nintendo, and Taka, born in 1909, who would end up inheriting Haikyô.[9] Kimi would end up marrying Shikanojô Inaba, a marriage from which was born Hiroshi Yamauchi.[9]
He suffered a stroke in 1948 and retired in 1949.[10] Near death, he quickly recruited his 21-year-old grandson, Hiroshi Yamauchi, to quit college and inherit the family business. Hiroshi Yamauchi's father, Shikanojo Inaba, had forfeited inheritance because he had abandoned his family when Yamauchi was five years old.[11][12][13] His ashes today reside within the same building he built in 1933.[5][9]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanafuda,Hanafuda,"
Hanafuda (Japanese: 花札, lit. 'flower cards'[1][2]) are a type of Japanese playing cards. They are typically smaller than Western playing cards, only 5.4 by 3.2 centimetres (2.1 by 1.3 in), but thicker and stiffer.[3] On the face of each card is a depiction of plants, tanzaku (短冊), animals, birds, or man-made objects.[4][5] One single card depicts a human. The back side is usually plain, without a pattern or design of any kind, and traditionally colored either red or black. Hanafuda are used to play a variety of games including Koi-Koi and Hachi-Hachi.
In Korea, hanafuda are known as hwatu (Korean: 화투, Hanja: 花鬪, 'flower battle') and made of plastic with a textured back side.[6] The most popular game is Go-stop (Korean: 고스톱), commonly played during special holidays such as Lunar New Year and Chuseok (Korean: 추석).[7][8]
In Hawaii, hanafuda is used to play Sakura.[9] Hanafuda is also played in Micronesia, where it is known as hanahuda and is used to play a four-person game, which is often played in partnerships.[10]
Playing cards were introduced to Japan by the Portuguese in the mid-16th century. The Portuguese deck consisted of 48 cards, with four suits divided into 12 ranks. The first Japanese-made decks made during the Tenshō period (1573–1592) mimicked Portuguese decks and are referred to as Tenshō Karuta. The main game was a trick-taking game intermediate in evolution between Triunfo and Ombre.[11] After Japan closed off all contact with the Western world in 1633, foreign playing cards were banned.[12]
In 1648, Tenshō Karuta were banned by the Tokugawa shogunate.[13] During prohibition, gambling with cards remained highly popular which led to disguised card designs. Each time gambling with a card deck of a particular design became too popular, the government banned it, which then prompted the creation of a new design. This cat-and-mouse game between the government and rebellious gamblers resulted in the creation of increasingly abstract and minimalist regional patterns (地方札). These designs were initially called Yomi Karuta after the popular Poch-like game of Yomi which was known by the 1680s.[14]
Through the Meiwa, An'ei, and Tenmei eras (roughly 1764–1789), a game called Mekuri took the place of Yomi. It became so popular that Yomi Karuta was renamed Mekuri Karuta.[14] Mechanically, Mekuri is similar to Chinese fishing games.[15] Cards became so commonly used for gambling that they were banned in 1791, during the Kansei era. On the other hand, Uta-garuta such as Hyakunin Isshu were officially permitted as being educationally beneficial. So as a loophole to the ban, early hanafuda were made to have old poems on some of the cards, disguising them as Uta-garuta. Remnants of this can be seen via the tanzaku-ranked cards.
The earliest known reference to hana awase (a previous version of hanafuda) is from 1816 when it was recorded as a banned gambling tool. The earliest decks contained between 12, 20, and even 32 suits, each with one high value card, one tanzaku card, and two low-value cards.[16]
As hana awase modernized into hanafuda, it standardized at 12 months (suits) with four rank-like categories. The majority of hanafuda games are descended from Mekuri although Yomi adaptations for the flower cards survived until the 20th century.[14] Though they can still be used for gambling, its structure and design is less convenient than other decks such as Kabufuda. In the Meiji period, playing cards became tolerated by the authorities.
In 1889, Fusajiro Yamauchi founded Nintendo for the purposes of producing and selling hand-crafted hanafuda.[17] Nintendo has focused on video games since the 1970s but continues to produce cards in Japan, including themed sets based on Mario, Pokémon, and Kirby.[18][19][20] The Koi-Koi game played with hanafuda is included in Nintendo's own Clubhouse Games (2006) for the Nintendo DS, and Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics (2020) for the Nintendo Switch.[21]
Though modern Japanese hanafuda is primarily made today by either of the long-standing Oishi Tengudo (1800) or Nintendo (1889), dozens of others have manufactured hanafuda, such as Angel, Tamura Shogundo, Matsui Tengudo, Ace, Maruē, and many more.[22]
Hanafuda were likely introduced to Korea during the late 1890s[23][24] and to Hawaii in the early 1900s.[9] Since then, companies and individuals in Korea and Hawaii have produced their own hanafuda, sometimes adapting the original Japanese imagery to fit either culture. Also made for western audiences are decks which fuse hanafuda with Toranpu (トランプ, ""Trumps"" a.k.a. the standard 52-card deck). These decks have indices on all their cards, and introduce a 13th suit which varies considerably by manufacturer (jokers, flowers, objects from japanese imagery, left blank or used as a ""snow"" suit, left as western Kings, etc.).
There are 48 cards total, divided into twelve suits, representing months of the year. Each suit is designated by a flower and has four cards.[25] An extra blank card may be included to serve as a replacement. In Korean hwatu decks, several joker cards (조커패) award various bonuses.[26]
The standard categorizations and point values for each card are as follows. Note that some games change the point values or categorizations of the cards. For example, in the game Hachi-Hachi [ja], all of the November cards count as kasu, and in the game Sakura, the values of the cards are different.
A few cards in hanafuda contain Japanese text. In addition to the examples below, the December kasu cards typically display the manufacturer's name and marks, similar to the Ace of spades in western playing cards.
Edo-period hanafuda frequently had poems on them in order to disguise themselves as uta-garuta (poem playing cards) with illustrations. This tradition continued on some cards produced after the ban on playing cards was lifted, but it is now rare. Cards that have lines of poetry on them are usually the less ornate kasu cards.
Cards made early after the end of the ban often had the name of the corresponding month on the tanzaku cards, and sometimes numbers on all the cards. This made it easier for new players to play games that require knowing what suit is associated with what number, such as Yomi-derived games and kabufuda games.
In Korean hwatu decks, the writing on the tanzaku cards is replaced with Korean text naming the type of card it is. Similar text is usually present on the blue tanzaku cards as well. In addition to the examples below, the manufacturer's name and marks are often prominently present on the various joker cards, and the manufacturer's logo is typically featured on the full moon card.

In Unicode, a symbol to represent hanafuda is available at U+1F3B4 🎴 FLOWER PLAYING CARDS in the Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs block.[30]  This character is typically rendered as the Full Moon with Red Sky card.[31] It was added as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 for compatibility with a KDDI emoji character,[32] and was added to Unicode Emoji 1.0 in 2015.[31]
Nintendo's Clubhouse Games and Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics feature hanafuda and Koi-Koi.[33][34] Mario Kart Tour includes hanafuda-themed gliders. Other video games which feature Koi-Koi include the Yakuza series and Sakura Wars.[35][36] Hanafuda and sets of yaku are featured in fighting game series Samurai Shodown.
In the 2009 anime film Summer Wars, characters play Koi-Koi, a popular hanafuda game. In Naruto, three characters (Yamanaka Ino, Nara Shikamaru, and Akimichi Choji) form a group known as ""Ino-Shika-Cho"", a card combination found in several hanafuda games. In an anime-only episode of Dragon Ball, there is a boar-deer-butterfly hybrid creature called the InoShikaCho. In Demon Slayer, the main character Tanjiro Kamado has a pair of earrings that resemble the sun hikari. 
In the popular trading card game Yu-Gi-Oh!, there is an archetype known as ""Flower Cardian” with hanafuda motifs for various cards.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Benson,George Benson,"George Washington Benson (born March 22, 1943)[3] is an American jazz fusion guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He began his professional career at the age of 19 as a jazz guitarist.
A former child prodigy, Benson first came to prominence in the 1960s, playing soul jazz with Jack McDuff and others. He then launched a successful solo career, alternating between jazz, pop, R&B singing, and scat singing. His album Breezin' was certified triple-platinum, hitting No. 1 on the Billboard album chart in 1976.[4] His concerts were well attended through the 1980s, and he still has a large following.[4] Benson has won ten Grammy Awards and has been honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Benson was born and raised in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[5][6] At the age of seven, he first played the ukulele in a corner drug store, for which he was paid a few dollars. At age eight, he played guitar[5] in an unlicensed nightclub on Friday and Saturday nights, but the police soon closed the club down. At age nine, he started to record. Out of the four sides he cut, two were released: ""She Makes Me Mad"" backed with ""It Should Have Been Me"",[1] with RCA Victor in New York. Although one source indicates this record was released under the name ""Little Georgie"",[5] the 45rpm label is printed with the name George Benson.  The single was produced by Leroy Kirkland for RCA's rhythm and blues label, Groove Records.[7]
Benson attended Connelley Vocational High School on Bedford Avenue in the Hill District. However, he dropped out, choosing to focus on music.[8][9] In 1987, Benson received an honorary degree from Pittsburgh Public Schools.[9]
As a youth, Benson learned how to play straight-ahead instrumental jazz during a relationship performing for several years with organist Jack McDuff. One of his many early guitar heroes was country-jazz guitarist Hank Garland.[10][11]
At the age of 21, he recorded his first album as leader, The New Boss Guitar of George Benson (1964), featuring McDuff.[3] Benson's next recording was It's Uptown (1966) with the George Benson Quartet, including Lonnie Smith on organ and Ronnie Cuber on baritone saxophone. Benson followed it up with The George Benson Cookbook (1967), also with Lonnie Smith and Ronnie Cuber on baritone and drummer Marion Booker.[3] Miles Davis employed Benson in the mid-1960s, featuring his guitar on ""Paraphernalia"" on his 1968 Columbia release, Miles in the Sky before Benson went to Verve Records.
In 1970, Benson released The Other Side of Abbey Road, featuring renditions of songs from the Beatles' 1969 album Abbey Road.
Benson then signed with Creed Taylor's jazz label CTI Records, where he recorded several albums, with jazz heavyweights guesting, to some success, mainly in the jazz field. In addition to his own albums and performances, during this time Benson was a core member of the CTI All-Stars collective both touring and recording.[12] As well as the collective's live albums, he also played and recorded on a number of the collective's members' individual albums, including Freddie Hubbard and Stanley Turrentine, notably on the latter's acclaimed album Sugar (1970).[13] Benson played on Hubbard's 1971 album First Light, which won a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Performance by a Group at the 15th Annual Grammy Awards,[14] as well as five other Hubbard studio albums.[15]
Benson released a version of ""White Rabbit"" on the album of the same name in 1972, originally written and recorded by San Francisco rock group Great Society, and made famous by Jefferson Airplane.[3] His 1974 release, Bad Benson, climbed to the top spot in the Billboard jazz chart, while the 1976 follow-ups, Good King Bad (No. 51 Pop album) and Benson & Farrell (with Joe Farrell), both reached the jazz top-three sellers.
By the mid-to-late 1970s, as he recorded for Warner Bros. Records, a whole new audience began to discover Benson. On 1976's Breezin', Benson sang a lead vocal on the track ""This Masquerade"", a song written by Leon Russell. Benson's version (notable also for the lush, romantic piano intro and solo by Jorge Dalto), became a huge pop hit and won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year.[16] (He had sung vocals infrequently on albums earlier in his career, notably his rendition of ""Here Comes the Sun"" on The Other Side of Abbey Road.[16]) The rest of the album is instrumental, including his rendition of the 1975 José Feliciano composition ""Affirmation"".
In 1976, Benson embarked on a tour called George & Minnie Live! with soul singer Minnie Riperton; she had recently been diagnosed with terminal breast cancer and would die in 1979. In addition, Benson appeared as a guitarist and backup vocalist on Stevie Wonder's song ""Another Star"" from Wonder's album Songs in the Key of Life (1976).
He also recorded the original version of ""The Greatest Love of All"" for the 1977 Muhammad Ali biopic, The Greatest,[16] which was later covered by Whitney Houston as ""Greatest Love of All.""[17] During this time Benson recorded with the German conductor Claus Ogerman.[18] The live take of ""On Broadway,"" recorded a few months later from the 1978 release Weekend in L.A., also won a Grammy.[16][19]
The Qwest record label (a subsidiary of Warner Bros., run by Quincy Jones) released Benson's breakthrough pop album Give Me the Night, produced by Jones.[16] Benson made it into the pop and R&B top ten with the song ""Give Me the Night"" (written by former Heatwave keyboardist Rod Temperton). He had many hit singles such as ""Love All the Hurt Away"", ""Turn Your Love Around"", ""Inside Love"", ""Lady Love Me"", ""20/20"", ""Shiver"", and ""Kisses in the Moonlight"".  More importantly, Jones encouraged Benson to search his roots for further vocal inspiration, and he rediscovered his love for Nat King Cole, Ray Charles and Donny Hathaway in the process, influencing a string of further vocal albums into the 1990s. Despite returning to his jazz and guitar playing most recently, this theme was reflected again much later in Benson's 2000 release Absolute Benson, featuring a cover of one of Hathaway's most notable songs, ""The Ghetto"". Benson accumulated three other platinum LPs and two gold albums.[17]
In 1990, Benson was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from the Berklee College of Music.[20]
To commemorate the long relationship between Benson and Ibanez and to celebrate 30 years of collaboration on the GB Signature Models, Ibanez created the GB30TH, a limited-edition model with a gold-foil finish inspired by the traditional Japanese Garahaku art form.[21]
In 2009, Benson was recognized by the National Endowment of the Arts as a Jazz Master, the United States highest honor in jazz.[23] Benson performed at the 49th issue of the Ohrid Summer Festival in North Macedonia on July 25, 2009, and his tribute show to Nat King Cole, An Unforgettable Tribute to Nat King Cole, as part of the Istanbul International Jazz Festival in Turkey on July 27. 
In late 2009, Benson finished recording an album entitled Songs and Stories with Marcus Miller, producer John Burk,[24] and session musicians David Paich and Steve Lukather.[25] As part of the promotion for the album, Benson appeared or performed on The Tavis Smiley Show,[26] Jimmy Kimmel Live![27] and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.[28]
He performed at the 2011 Java Jazz Festival during March 4–6. On October 4, Benson released the album Guitar Man, revisiting his 1960s/early-1970s guitar-playing roots with a 12-song collection of covers of both jazz and pop standards produced by John Burk.[29]
In June 2013, Benson released his fourth album for Concord, Inspiration: A Tribute to Nat King Cole, which included Wynton Marsalis, Idina Menzel, Till Brönner, and Judith Hill. In September, he returned to perform at Rock in Rio festival, in Rio de Janeiro, 35 years after his first performance at this festival, which was then the inaugural one.[30]
In July 2016, Benson participated as a mentor in the Sky Arts programme Guitar Star in the search for the UK and Republic of Ireland's most talented guitarist.[31]

In May 2018, Benson was featured on the Gorillaz single ""Humility"".[32]On July 12, 2018, it was announced that Benson had signed to Mascot Label Group.[33]
Benson stopped touring internationally at the start of 2024 due to ill health, cancelling a series of UK concerts that summer.[34]
Benson released a new album, Dreams Do Come True: When George Benson Meets Robert Farnon on July 19, 2024.[35][36] The album was an abandoned project based on recordings with arranger and conductor Robert Farnon backed by the London Symphony Orchestra from 1989 that were thought to have been lost. Upon location of the masters, Benson played them for his current label, Rhino Entertainment, who encouraged Benson to complete the project.[35] Were the album released when it was recorded it would have predated most of the wave of Great American Songbook albums released by popular artists at the end of the 20th century and well into the 21st century. Benson also announced plans for a four-night festival called Breezin' with the Stars planned for January 2025.[35]
Benson has been married to Johnnie Lee since 1965 and has seven children. Benson describes his music as focusing more on love and romance, due to his commitment to his family and religious practices, with Benson being a Jehovah's Witness.[37] Benson has been a resident of Englewood, New Jersey.[38]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Power,Nintendo Power,"
Nintendo Power was a video game news and strategy magazine from Nintendo of America, first published in July/August 1988 as Nintendo's official print magazine for North America. The magazine's publication was initially done monthly by Nintendo of America, then independently, and in December 2007 contracted to Future US, the American subsidiary of British publisher Future plc.[2] Its 24-year production run is one of the longest of all video game magazines in the United States and Canada.
On August 21, 2012, Nintendo announced that it would not be renewing its licensing agreement with Future Publishing, and that Nintendo Power would cease publication in December.[1][3] The final issue, volume 285, was released on December 11, 2012.[4]
On December 20, 2017, a podcast version of Nintendo Power was launched, which ran until 2023.  It was hosted by Chris Slate, the former Editor-in-Chief of the  magazine.  The podcast is on hiatus as of 2025.
Nintendo Fun Club News preceded Nintendo Power as a newsletter sent to club members for free.[5] In mid-1988 it was discontinued after seven issues[6] in favor of Nintendo Power. The new magazine was founded by Nintendo of America marketing manager Gail Tilden in 1988.[7] The first issue, dated July/August 1988, spotlights the NES game Super Mario Bros. 2. Of this issue, 3.6 million copies were published, with every member of the Nintendo Fun Club receiving a free copy.
From the beginning, Nintendo Power focuses heavily on providing game strategy, reviews, and previews of upcoming games. In mid-1998, Nintendo Power first allowed outside advertising in the magazine, formerly reserved for Nintendo-based products only. In its early years, ads only appeared in the first and last few pages of the magazine, leaving no ads to break up the magazine's editorial content.
In July 2005, Nintendo Power introduced a new design to appeal to a limited gaming audience, including a new logo and article format. Along with the cosmetic overhaul came a greater focus on Nintendo fans, staff reviews, rumor-milling, and fan service including an expanded and enhanced reader mail segment (known as ""Pulse"") and a revamped ""Community"" section. Nintendo introduced a new incentive promotional offer that involved the registration of three Nintendo (or Nintendo affiliated) products through Nintendo.com to receive a free three issue trial subscription to Nintendo Power. Later, the magazine changed its focus from game strategies and cheat codes to mainly news, previews, and articles on upcoming games.
On September 19, 2007, Nintendo officially announced that the large magazine publisher Future US would begin publishing Nintendo Power. The company's first official issue was released in October, as issue #222 (December 2007). It was also revealed that circulation would be increased to 13 issues a year, with the extra magazine being a holiday season bonus issue. Nintendo Power stopped making the Bonus issue in 2011.[8]
On August 21, 2012, Nintendo announced that it had opted not to renew the licensing agreement with Future Publishing and that Nintendo Power would cease publication after 24 years. The final issue would be December 2012. Senior Editor Chris Hoffman stated that his staff would ""try to make the last issues memorable"". Nintendo reportedly did not actively participate in discussions to continue the magazine online.[9][10]
Nintendo Power officially returned on December 20, 2017 as a podcast; the podcast uses the original logo design.
The magazine was founded by Gail Tilden with support from Nintendo's first Fun Club ""President"" Howard Phillips, an avid gamer. While the Fun Club News focused solely on games made in-house by Nintendo, Nintendo Power was created to allow for reviews of games produced by those licensed by Nintendo, such as Konami and Capcom. Nintendo Power's mascot in the late 1980s and early 1990s was Nester, a character created by the staff at Work House, Japan who first appeared in the magazine's Howard and Nester comic strip. After Phillips left the company, Nester became the magazine's sole mascot. Early issues of the magazine featured a two-page Howard and Nester comic, which was later replaced with the two-page Nester's Adventures, later reduced to one page, and eventually dropped altogether. Subsequently, Mario replaced Nester as the mascot of the magazine. During the early 2000s, the magazine made another mascot out of its Senior Writer, Alan Averill. Apparently very camera-shy, Averill never appeared in any photos; rather, he was represented by a plush toy of a Blue Slime from Dragon Quest. Fans often clamored to see what Averill actually looked like, but the magazine continued to substitute photos of the toy, and even claimed that Alan was, in fact, a Blue Slime. Eventually, Averill retired from Nintendo Power, joining Nintendo of America's localization department. To this day, most fans have never seen a real image of Averill. The inclusion of a photo of Mr. T in the Player's Pulse section became a running gag in the early half of 2005. Late in the magazine's life, running gags centered on Chuck Norris references and jokes at the expense of writer Chris Shepperd.
During the early 1990s, the magazine undertook a unique and powerful promotion: giving away a free copy of the NES game Dragon Warrior (Dragon Quest in Japan) to every new subscriber.[11]  The Dragon Quest series had been a huge hit in Japan, and Nintendo had hoped the localized North American release would also be a success and promote the RPG genre.  However, the game had not sold nearly as well as Nintendo had anticipated, leaving the company with a large number of unsold cartridges.  The promotion both helped the company get rid of the unsold merchandise, and won the magazine thousands of new subscribers.[12] During this time, Nintendo would also send VHS tapes to subscribers containing promotional videos for upcoming games.[13][14][15]
Following the release of the Super NES, the magazine featured lengthy, continuous comic strips based on Super Mario World and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. After these stories ended, they were replaced by similar multi-issue stories based on Star Fox, Super Metroid, and later, Nintendo 64 games such as Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire and Blast Corps. It had several comics based on the animated series of Pokémon and Kirby: Right Back at Ya!. Toward the end, it included short excerpts based on Custom Robo and Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. It included a very short Metroid Prime comic, and another story based on the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games translated from the original Japanese version.
Nintendo Power produced a series of strategy magazines called Official Guides from Nintendo Power, beginning with The Official Nintendo Player's Guide. After Nintendo Power switched from a bi-monthly magazine to a monthly magazine in May 1990, some issues were positioned as strategy guides for single games replacing the guides. However, only four such issues were produced before Nintendo outsourced production of official guides to Prima Games.
The Nintendo Power Line was a staffed hotline providing gameplay hints about Nintendo consoles, such as the Nintendo Entertainment System.[16] It ran from the publishing of the first issue publication of Nintendo Power in 1988 until June 2010, closing in favor of the Internet.[17] The hotline was revived as automated messages, from November 11 to November 13, 2016, in celebration of the release of the NES Classic Edition.[18]
During 2001, Nintendo Power released a spin-off semi-magazine named Nintendo Power Advance, featuring the Game Boy Advance and its games. The first issue was complimentary for subscribers, and sold at newsstands. Four issues of Nintendo Power Advance were printed, the last of which is a strategy guide for Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2.[19]
With the release of Pokémon for the Game Boy in 1998, Nintendo Power includes six mini-issues of Pokémon Power mainly featuring tips and strategies for the game.
In 1989, a smaller version of the magazine called Pocket Power was distributed at movie theaters showing The Wizard.[20]
Nester is the mascot of Nintendo Power. Nester was created by Howard Phillips, ""President"" of the Nintendo Fun Club and a former editor of Nintendo Power, to be the supporting character in his comic strip, Howard & Nester. The comic strips generally advertised new games, often by dream sequences where Nester was actually a given video game character. From 1989 to 1993, The Nintendo Power Awards featured Nester-shaped trophies and were referred to in the magazine as the ""Nesters"" in reference to the Oscars.
In the June 1991 issue (Volume 25), Phillips was written out of the strip after his real-life counterpart left Nintendo to work for LucasArts. The strip was retitled Nester's Adventures the following issue and continued publication until Volume 55 (December 1993). Nester, now as a college student, appeared in Nintendo Power issue #100.[21] He is seen again in issue #231, the magazine's twentieth anniversary, here a grown man with a son new to Nintendo.[21] Nester's final appearance in Nintendo Power is in the final issue, Volume 285, in a comic titled ""Nester & Max"", where he is seen reading and lamenting the final issue.[22]
Nester is featured in a few video games that were released while the character was in the magazine. His first appearance was as a commentator in NES Play Action Football. Other appearances include the ending of To the Earth. Nester is the main character in Nester's Funky Bowling for the Virtual Boy, which also introduces his sister Hester. The character of Lark in Pilotwings 64 for the Nintendo 64 was based on Nester.[23] Several NES games feature the name ""NESTER"" as one of the pre-set names on high-score lists, or a default character name such as in To the Earth.  The original NES release of Dragon Warrior references both Howard and Nester through character dialog, however this was removed in the later Game Boy Color version.  He is mentioned in one line of dialogue in the game StarTropics. A DLC microgame in WarioWare D.I.Y. created by Nintendo Power called Funky Boxing (a loose reference to Nester's Funky Bowling) does not have any apparent references to the character, but if the game is opened in the editor, the player's boxer is named ""NESTER"".[24]
On December 20, 2017, Nintendo of America announced the official return of Nintendo Power as a podcast, hosted by former Editor-in-Chief of the original magazine, Chris Slate.[25] In the first episode, Slate states that the podcast was a ""passion project"" for Nintendo and that he wanted Nintendo Power to return. He also acknowledged that the format of that episode was experimental and that the frequency of the series' episodes hasn't been determined.[26] Later in the episode, Slate interviews the developers of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and discusses the Nintendo Switch.[27]
On May 12, 2023, an episode based on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was released. In it, Chris Slate announced that the episode is the final planned one for the podcast. He followed up by stating that there may still be more special episodes later.

Retro Gamer is a British magazine, published worldwide, covering retro video games. It was the first commercial magazine to be devoted entirely to the subject. Launched in January 2004[clarification needed] as a quarterly publication, Retro Gamer soon became a monthly. In 2005, a general decline in gaming and computer magazine readership led to the closure of its publishers, Live Publishing,[1] and the rights to the magazine were later purchased by Imagine Publishing.[2] It was taken over by Future plc on 21 October 2016, following Future's acquisition of Imagine Publishing.
The first 18 issues of the magazine came with a coverdisk.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_Pro,iMac Pro,"
The iMac Pro is an all-in-one personal computer and workstation sold by Apple from 2017 to 2021. At its release, it was one of four desktop computers in the Macintosh lineup, sitting above the consumer range Mac Mini and iMac, and serving as an all-in-one alternative to the Mac Pro. After the cylindrical Mac Pro redesign went years without any update, Apple hosted a roundtable with journalists promising a redesign and commitment to professional Mac computers; the iMac Pro was introduced in the interim before the revised Mac Pro shipped in 2019.
Externally, the iMac Pro is nearly identical to the consumer iMac, albeit in a darker finish. Apple redesigned the internals to provide cooling for workstation Intel Xeon processors and AMD Vega graphics. The iMac Pro was positively received by critics, who praised its quiet performance and appeal as an all-in-one machine, while criticizing its lack of expansion and upgradability, as well as the drawbacks it retained from the regular iMac. After receiving only minor updates, the machine was discontinued in March 2021, its niche in Apple's lineup replaced by the revised Mac Pro and the Mac Studio.
In 2013, Apple replaced its tower Mac Pro workstation computer with a radically redesigned cylindrical model. The 2013 Mac Pro was sold for years without any updates, and Apple later said that its small design and focus on dual graphics processing units (GPU) had been a mistake. In April 2017, Apple convened a roundtable of journalists and executives to restate their commitment to professional Macs. As part of the announcement, Apple said a new monitor and Mac Pro were being developed but would not arrive that year. In June, Apple announced the iMac Pro to fill the gap.[2][3][4]
The iMac Pro is an all-in-one workstation computer. It uses nearly the same chassis design as the 27-inch iMac that it was sold alongside, having the same screen, exterior dimensions, and stand.[5][6] The iMac Pro comes in a darker ""space gray"" finish, with a color-matched Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad.[6][7] The iMac Pro also has more connectivity options than the iMac, with four Thunderbolt 3 ports, four Universal Serial Bus (USB-A) ports, a headphone jack, and an SDXC card slot. The iMac Pro was the first Mac to ship with a 10 Gigabit Ethernet port, which can switch between speeds based on the connected network. The iMac Pro has IEEE 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 wireless networking built in.[6]
Internally, the iMac Pro has a substantially different arrangement than the regular iMac. The space for a 3.5-inch hard drive has been removed, being replaced with a larger cooling system for the processor.[8] The iMac Pro uses Intel Xeon-W processors. It was the first Mac equipped with Apple's T2 chip, a custom Apple coprocessor that performs tasks, including the system management and storage controllers, previously performed by a number of different chips. It also encrypts the iMac Pro's storage, and has an image signal processor.[9] Other changes from the regular iMac include a webcam that records at higher resolutions (1080p), additional microphones for better sound quality, and larger speakers.[9]
Unlike the 27-inch iMac, the iMac Pro does not have a memory access hatch on the back, and upgrades require disassembling the computer. The processor is likewise socketed for upgrades, although the graphics processing unit (GPU) is soldered to the motherboard.[8] The solid-state drive (SSD) is user-replaceable, but requires disassembly of the iMac Pro and an Apple Configurator restore after the new storage modules are installed.[10] The iMac Pro's stand is user-replaceable with a licensed OEM VESA mount kit sold by Apple. The mount uses zinc screws that may be prone to breaking.[11]
The iMac Pro was announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 5, 2017, and was released on December 14, 2017. Apple billed it as ""the most powerful Mac ever made"".[12][13] The computer shipped in a base configuration of an 8-core Xeon processor, AMD Vega 56 GPU, 32 GB of ECC memory, and a 1 TB SSD. It could be configured to an 18-core Xeon processor (sacrificing per-core clock speed for more multiprocessing power,) AMD Vega 64 graphics, 128 GB of memory, and a 2 TB SSD.[9] Unlike other Apple computers of the time, each component upgrade was available a la carte, rather than some upgrades being tied to higher-priced configurations.[6]
The iMac Pro received only minor updates after release. The configuration options were updated on March 19, 2019, adding a 256 GB memory and AMD Vega 64X graphics option.[14] Apple discontinued the 8-core processor option on August 4, 2020, making the 10-core model the base model.[15] The iMac Pro was discontinued on March 5, 2021; Apple continued to sell the computer while supplies lasted. It was delisted from Apple's website and online store on March 19, 2021.[16] Apple directed customers to either purchase an iMac, which had become faster than the iMac Pro, or to the Mac Pro.[17] The discontinuation preceded the release of iMac models powered by Apple's custom processors, which pivoted the iMac line towards a more entry-level consumer focus; Apple targeted the enthusiast and professional market instead with more powerful Mac minis and a new machine, the Mac Studio.[1][18][19]
The iMac Pro was positively received. Jason Snell, writing for Macworld, said that it was clearly not for average customers, but filled a niche for users like himself who had drifted from using pro desktops to iMacs yet still wanted more power than Apple's consumer line could offer.[7] Wired, ZDNet, and others considered the iMac Pro a statement from Apple that it was renewing its commitment to pro Macs.[8][20][21] Ars Technica's Samuel Axon and Macworld's Dan Moren found that while the machine was priced and equipped beyond what a consumer would need, it felt short addressing every professional niche that the Mac Pro traditionally filled;[21][22] The Verge's Dieter Bohn and PCMag's Tom Brant suggested that some professional users would want to hold off on buying an iMac Pro, since it was unclear at launch how it would compare to the upcoming Mac Pros.[5]
Critics praised Apple for being able to fit a more powerful computer in the iMac's svelte frame.[6][23] The identical design was considered a strength and weakness, with critics noting that the iMac Pro inherited the faults of the regular iMac's design, such as hard-to-reach ports, a wide bezel around the screen, and not allowing height adjustment using the stand.[6][24][25] CNET's Lori Grunin faulted the professional machine for still using a consumer-class display from the base iMac, despite the all-in-one nature of the machine.[25] Reviews noted that, even with its high-performance internals, the machine was quiet in operation.[6][23][25]
Performance tests showed that the iMac Pro was highly performant, with PCMag ranking it as the fastest all-in-one computer they had tested.[6][9] ZDNet's testing found that the iMac Pro regularly beat the iMac on most tasks, although depending on the workflow the speed might not justify the added cost.[8] Though critics generally felt the high price was fair for the technology included,[8][23] reviews often noted that most users could get a significant portion of the performance for much cheaper by getting a regular iMac.[22][25] Grunin also questioned the wisdom of spending so much on an all-in-one machine when a user's needs could quickly outstrip the machine's capabilities.[25] Subsequent iMac revisions narrowed the performance gap, with the cheaper models often faster in certain metrics.[26]
After the iMac Pro's discontinuation, Jason Snell picked the machine as one of the greatest Macs of the 2010s, and one that helped tell the story of Apple during that period. Suggesting the iMac Pro was at one time intended to replace the Mac Pro entirely, Snell referred to it as ""the ultimate pro Mac of an alternate timeline"" where this had come to pass.[27][28] Technology blogger John Gruber called the iMac Pro the best Mac of the Intel era.[29]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_evangelist,Technology evangelist,"A technology evangelist is someone who builds a critical mass of support for a specific technology, and then establishes it as a technical standard in a market that is subject to network effects.[1] The word evangelism is borrowed from the context of religious evangelism due to the similarity of sharing information about a particular concept with the intention of having others adopt that concept. This is typically accomplished by showcasing the potential uses and benefits of a technology to help others understand how they can use it for themselves.
Platform evangelism is one target of technology evangelism, in which the vendor of a two-sided platform attempts to accelerate the production of complementary goods by independent developers[2] (e.g., during its early years, Facebook worked on creating an ecosystem of third party developers, encouraging them to create games or develop mobile apps that could enhance users' experiences with Facebook).
Professional technology evangelists are often employed by firms seeking to establish their technologies as de facto standards. Their work could also entail the training of personnel, including top managers so that they acquire skills and competencies necessary to adopt new technology or new technological initiative.[3] There are even instances when technology evangelism becomes an aspect of a managerial position.[4]
Open-source evangelists, on the other hand, operate independently. Evangelists also participate in defining open standards. Non-professional technology evangelists may act out of altruism or self-interest (e.g., to gain the benefits of early adoption or  the network effect).
In Christianity, the word evangelist comes from the Koine Greek word ""εὐαγγέλιον"" (transliterated as euangelion) via Latinised evangelium, as used in the canonical titles of the Four Gospels, attributed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John (also known as the Four Evangelists).
The term software evangelist was coined by Mike Murray of Apple Computer's Macintosh computer division[5] in the early 1980s.[6] It was part of Apple's drive to compete with IBM and it specifically described the initiative to win over third-party developers rhetorically to persuade them to develop software and applications for the Macintosh platform.[7] In Guy Kawasaki's own words, it meant ""using fervor and zeal (but never money) to convince software developers to create products for a computer with no installed base, 128K of RAM, no hard disk, no documentation, and no technical support, made by a flaky company that IBM was about to snuff out.""[8] The first so-identified technology evangelist was Mike Boich — who promoted the Macintosh computer.[9]
In 1987, Steve Ballmer introduced the technology evangelist role at Microsoft to build excitement and drive adoption of Windows and its development tools.[10]
The job is often closely related to both sales and training but requires specific technology marketing skills. For example, convincing a potential buyer or user to change from older methods to new ones. There is also the case of adopting new products such as green IT. The marketing aspect involved in technology evangelism was strongly influenced by Geoffrey Moore and his books concerning the technology adoption lifecycle. One of his positions maintain that the role of the evangelist becomes critical when addressing what he identified as the ""chasm"" that exists between early and mainstream adoption.[11]
Technology evangelism is sometimes associated with an internal employee assigned to encourage new practices within an organization. Methods of evangelism available include a modified STREET process (Scope, Track, Rank, Evaluate, Evangelize, Transfer) and the process that takes advantage of the hype cycle.[11] Evangelism can also assume the form of a learning process and employ tools such as learning management systems (LMS).[12]
Technology evangelists aim to inspire enthusiasm for a product or idea.   Successful evangelism requires strong corporate support and a deep understanding of technology.[1] Evangelists also draw on diverse skills, including marketing and psychology.[13] A study by Frederic Lucas-Conwell[1] considers the principal characteristics of the technology evangelist role to include:
Notable technology evangelists[13] in the commercial arena include Steve Jobs (Apple Inc.), Vint Cerf (Internet), Don Box, Guy Kawasaki, Chris Crawford,[14] Alex St. John, Robert Scoble, Myriam Joire (Pebble), Christian Allen (Epic Games), Mudasser Zaheer (Hewlett Packard Enterprise), and Dan Martin (MasterCard).
Court records[15][16] indicate that James Plamondon was a leading theorist, strategist, and practitioner of technology evangelism at Microsoft during its establishment of Microsoft Windows as the de facto standard PC operating system. 
Kawasaki, on the other hand, was credited for the remarkable growth of the software developed for the Macintosh, jumping from a few dozen products to more than 600 in less than a year of spreading the so-called Macintosh gospel.[7] He claims, ""Evangelism isn't a job title, it's a way of life.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services,Financial services,"Financial services are economic services tied to finance provided by financial institutions. Financial services encompass a broad range of service sector activities, especially as concerns financial management and consumer finance. 
The finance industry in its most common sense concerns commercial banks that provide market liquidity, risk instruments, and brokerage for large public companies and multinational corporations at a macroeconomic scale that impacts domestic politics and foreign relations. The extragovernmental power and scale of the finance industry remains an ongoing controversy in many industrialized Western economies, as seen in the American Occupy Wall Street civil protest movement of 2011.
Styles of financial institution includes credit union, bank, savings and loan association, trust company, building society, brokerage firm, payment processor, many types of broker, and some government-sponsored enterprise.[1]
Financial services include accountancy, investment banking, investment management, and personal asset management. 
Financial products include insurance, credit cards, mortgage loans, and pension funds. 
The term ""financial services"" became more prevalent in the United States partly as a result of the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of the late 1990s, which enabled different types of companies operating in the U.S. financial services industry at that time to merge.[3]
Companies usually have two distinct approaches to this new type of business. One approach would be a bank that simply buys an insurance company or an investment bank, keeps the original brands of the acquired firm, and adds the acquisition to its holding company simply to diversify its earnings. Outside the U.S. (e.g. Japan), non-financial services companies are permitted within the holding company. In this scenario, each company still looks independent and has its own customers, etc. In the other style, a bank would simply create its own insurance division or brokerage division and attempt to sell those products to its own existing customers, with incentives for combining all things with one company.[citation needed]
The financial sector is traditionally among those to receive government support in times of widespread economic crisis. Such bailouts, however, enjoy less public support than those for other industries.[4]
A commercial bank is what is commonly referred to as simply a bank. The term ""commercial"" is used to distinguish it from an investment bank, a type of financial services entity which instead of lending money directly to a business, helps businesses raise money from other firms in the form of bonds (debt) or share capital (equity).
The primary operations of commercial banks include:
The United States is the largest commercial banking services location.
New York City and London are the largest centers of investment banking services. NYC is dominated by U.S. domestic business, while in London international business and commerce make up a significant portion of investment banking activity.[5]
FX or Foreign exchange services are provided by many banks and specialists foreign exchange brokers around the world. Foreign exchange services include:
London handled 36.7% of global currency transactions in 2009[update] – an average daily turnover of US$1.85 trillion – with more US dollars traded in London than New York, and more Euros traded than in every other city in Europe combined.[6][7][8][9][10]
New York City is the largest center of investment services, followed by London.[12]
The United States, followed by Japan and the United Kingdom are the largest insurance markets in the world.[14]

A financial export is a financial service provided by a domestic firm (regardless of ownership) to a foreign firm or individual. While financial services such as banking, insurance, and investment management are often seen as domestic services, an increasing proportion of financial services are now being handled abroad, in other financial centres, for a variety of reasons. Some smaller financial centres, such as Bermuda, Luxembourg, and the Cayman Islands, lack sufficient size for a domestic financial services sector and have developed a role providing services to non-residents as offshore financial centres. The increasing competitiveness of financial services has meant that some countries, such as Japan, which were once self-sufficient, have increasingly imported financial services.[citation needed]
The leading financial exporter, in terms of exports less imports, is the United Kingdom, which had $95 billion of financial exports in 2014.[15] The UK's position is helped by both unique institutions (such as Lloyd's of London for insurance, the Baltic Exchange for shipping etc.)[16] and an environment that attracts foreign firms;[17] many international corporations have global or regional headquarters in the London and are listed on the London Stock Exchange, and many banks and other financial institutions operate there or in Edinburgh.[18][19]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Bank_(United_Kingdom),Metro Bank (United Kingdom),"
Metro Bank PLC is a retail and commercial bank operating in the United Kingdom, founded by Anthony Thomson and Vernon Hill in 2010.[2] At its launch it was the first new high street bank to launch in the United Kingdom in over 150 years.[4] It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.
After a period of rapid growth, Metro Bank hit difficulties in early 2019 when it announced it had insufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements, following the discovery of an error in the way it categorised its commercial loans for capital adequacy purposes. As a result, it had to raise an additional £350m of capital. Concerns over the announcement and the bank's ability to raise the capital resulted in the bank's share price falling by 75% in less than four months, and large depositors withdrawing cash, because of ""adverse sentiment"".
Metro Bank was founded by Anthony Thomson and Vernon Hill[2] and granted its licence by the Financial Services Authority on 5 March 2010, the first high-street bank to be granted such a licence for over 150 years.[4] It planned to open between 200 and 250 branches in Greater London within ten years of starting up.[5] Its first branch opened on 29 July 2010 in Holborn, central London.[6]
In 2012, the bank raised an additional $200 million in funding from investors including Fidelity, Steven A. Cohen of hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors, and New York real estate investors the LeFraks and David and Simon Reubens.[7] In the same year, Forbes magazine reported that Metro's flagship Holborn branch had ""...garnered $200 million in deposits, four times the total at the average mature American branch"".[7]
On 2 May 2013 the Daily Telegraph reported that, following a loss of £8.8 million in the first quarter of 2013, Metro Bank's pre-tax losses had exceeded £100 million in less than three years since its launch, but the bank stated that these were planned for,[8] and were ""a result of its growth initiatives"".[9] In an interview with the Financial Times, Hill said the bank was ""...in line with the business plan to rapidly grow this company"". He added: ""Our primary goal is to expand the business ... and profit certainly will come"".[10]
Metro Bank acquired SME Finance in August 2013, and rebranded the business as Metro Bank SME Finance in May 2014.[11]
In January 2019, Metro Bank admitted classifying a portfolio of commercial loans for capital purposes incorrectly, thereby failing to hold sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements;[12][13] the error applied to around 10% of its loan book.[12] The miscalculation was identified through a review by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) but Metro Bank erroneously gave the impression that the bank had identified the incorrect classification itself.[13] To correct the error in the capital classification, Metro Bank announced a £350m share issue and said it would reduce its growth plans. It was also reported that the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority were to investigate the circumstances of the error.[13] In December 2021, the bank was fined £5.38m by the PRA after their investigation, saying that it had ""failed to meet the standards of governance and controls expected of it"" with regards to the risk weighting and classification of commercial loans.[14]
As a result of the admission and the share issue announcement, Metro Bank's share price fell sharply, losing 40% of its value in the month after the announcement[15] and 75% in less than four months.[16] By March 2019, the BBC reported that Metro Bank shares were the second most shorted shares on the UK stock market.[17] Additionally, large depositors began withdrawing funds: Metro Bank admitted that there had been a 4% drop in its deposits in the first quarter of 2019 because of ""adverse sentiment"".[18]
It was announced in August 2020 that Metro Bank had agreed to acquire Retail Money Market Ltd, a London-based provider of peer-to-peer loans trading as RateSetter. The price would be between £2.5 million and £12 million, depending on performance over the next three years. The purchase was subject to regulatory approval and the agreement of Retail Money Market Ltd shareholders, and was expected to complete in the fourth quarter of 2020. Metro Bank would continue the RateSetter brand and its operations, but new unsecured personal lending would be funded by the bank's deposits, not through peer-to-peer.[19] In February 2021, Metro Bank bought RateSetter's entire portfolio of loans, valued at £384m.[20]
In February 2021, Metro Bank completed the £3.04 billion sale of a residential mortgage portfolio to NatWest. The deal was agreed upon in December 2020.[21][22]
In November 2021, Metro Bank entered talks with the Carlyle Group concerning a possible takeover bid.[23]
On 6–8 October 2022, Metro Bank's mobile banking app failed, resulting in its customers being unable to manage their accounts remotely.[24]
In October 2023, it was revealed that JPMorgan Chase had considered a bid for Metro Bank before opting not to proceed due to the capital required by the bank.[25] Metro was also claimed to have rejected an offer from fellow challenger bank Shawbrook.[26]
On 8 October 2023, Metro Bank secured a £325m capital raise alongside £600m of debt refinancing with Jaime Gilinski Bacal, the second richest person in Colombia, becoming the controlling shareholder with around a 53% stake in the business.[27][28]
In November 2024, Metro Bank was fined £16.7 million by the Financial Conduct Authority for failing to ensure an automated system was correctly checking customer transactions for potential money laundering until four years after it was installed.[29]
Metro Bank provides banking services to personal and business customers. It is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.[30]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PalmPilot,PalmPilot,"
The PalmPilot Personal and PalmPilot Professional are the second generation of Palm PDA devices produced by Palm Inc (then a subsidiary of U.S. Robotics, later 3Com). These devices were launched on March 10, 1997.[1]
Palm also sold the 10201U modem at 14.4 kbit/s, introduced at a price of $129 (this modem is also compatible with the Palm III and Palm IIIx devices). An upgrade kit was also available, which allowed users of the earlier Pilot 1000/5000 devices to upgrade the OS, ROM, and RAM to match the PalmPilot Professional. Initially suggested retail prices upon launch were $399 for the PalmPilot Professional (1 MB), $299 for the PalmPilot Personal (512 KB), and $199 for the Upgrade Kit. Upgrade kits were also available to existing registered Pilot users for $99 for a limited time after the launch. These kits included IR capability, a new plastic memory door to accommodate the IR diodes, a memory card with 1 MB, the new ROM for Palm OS 2.0, and a CD-ROM with updated desktop software.
The PalmPilot became a large success and helped Palm further establish itself as the leader in the growing PDA/handheld PC market.[2] PalmPilot had reportedly sold over 1 million units by 1998.[3]
It was succeeded by Palm III in 1998.
IMAX used a simulator that mimics the look and feel of a PalmPilot for its Quick Turn Reel Units (to keep it simple and familiar for Imax film projectionists), which are used to screen feature films in 70mm.[4]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EAccess,Ymobile,"Y!mobile is a Japanese mobile phone operator. Y!mobile is a brand used by SoftBank Corp., a subsidiary of Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank Group Corporation, that provides mobile telecommunications and ADSL services. The current CEO of the company is Ken Miyauchi. It was formed in 2014 through the merger of Willcom and eAccess, and uses the Y! moniker brand from Yahoo! Japan, which is partly owned by SoftBank.
On 1 April 2015, Ymobile Corporation merged into Softbank Mobile Corporation (now SoftBank Corporation), with the Y!mobile brand continuing to be used by the newly merged company.[2]
WILLCOM Inc. (株式会社ウィルコム, Kabushiki-gaisha Wirukomu) was a PHS operator based in Tokyo, offering flat-rate wireless network data transmission and flat-rate voice calls for its subscribers. The company was founded as a planning-company in 1994, and started to offer telephony services in 1995 under the brand DDI-Pocket. Its PHS network covered almost all of Japan, and had the largest share of the Japanese PHS market. It continued operating after other PHS operators had withdrawn their services. The company later became a subsidiary of KDDI. Willcom Okinawa Co., Ltd. was a subsidiary for operations in Okinawa.
In 2004, the Carlyle Group acquired a majority stake from KDDI and spun off DDI Pocket in February 2005, with the new company called Willcom. The number of its subscribers passed four million on May 29, 2006.
As an operator, it had mainly base stations of 500mW-radio output, unlike other PHS operators, which had mainly built 20 mW base stations. The high output level caused some radio interference and it was difficult to place calls in dense areas such as Shinjuku, Tokyo during the network's early days, although these problems were eventually solved. On the other hand, high output (and sensitivity) can also earn wider coverage of area per base station, therefore the operator was able to expand its coverage faster than the competition.
The market between PHS operators and cellular telephony companies was incredibly fierce, and until October 1996 it was not possible to make calls between PHS and cellular telephones. Even then, charges for calls between the two different systems were high.
PHS became popular because of its lower cost, causing cellular telephone companies to reduce their rates, which were initially considered too expensive. Furthermore, the coverage of the cellular companies quickly expanded to comparable levels. With the competitive advantage of PHS reduced, DDI-Pocket went through difficult years at the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s. The declining market for PHS service has caused the launch of its flat-rate service and its buyout by Carlyle.
On February 18, 2010, Willcom filed for bankruptcy with 206 billion yen in liabilities.[3] This took place after Willcom was unable to reschedule its debt payments; the company had been losing subscribers to competing networks with greater data speeds.[3] In December 2010 SoftBank purchased 100% of shares issued by Willcom.[4] Willcom was in the process of rehabilitation under the Corporate Rehabilitation Act.[1]
On June 1, 2014, Willcom was merged with eAccess and formed Ymobile.
The company eAccess was established on November 1, 1999, by Dr Sachio Semmoto as an ADSL fixed line broadband provider. Semmoto founded EMOBILE Ltd. (イー・モバイル株式会社) on January 5, 2005, as a subsidiary of eAccess,[5] offering 3G/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA/LTE services. As they used to offer only data services they were not widely known, but after teaming up with NTT DoCoMo to offer voice services, they became more popular. EMOBILE had a reseller/virtual network arrangement with several fixed-line ISPs including ASAHI Net. As of March 31, 2009 their website claimed 90% coverage of Japan's population.
As of April 17, 2009 EMOBILE introduced HSUPA to metropolitan areas claiming support for 5.8 Mbit/s. As of early 2011, 21 Mbit/s HSPA+ and 42 Mbit/s DC-HSPA+ is available in major metropolitan areas, depending upon the subscriber modem used. On March 15, 2012, they began offering LTE service with initial advertised speeds of 75 Mbit/s. It is claimed that this speed will eventually increase to 112 Mbit/s.
Total EMOBILE subscribers as of April 30, 2009 was 1.53 million.  
On January 1, 2013, eAccess became a wholly owned subsidiary of SoftBank Corporation (now SoftBank Group Corporation).[6] eAccess merged with Willcom to form Ymobile in July 2014.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Heroes,Sega Heroes,"Sega Heroes (originally known as Sega Legends) was a free-to-play puzzle video game developed by Demiurge Studios and published by Sega for Android and iOS. Released on November 14, 2018, the game ceased operations in May 2020 following Demiurge's split from Sega to become an independent video game developer.[1][2]
Sega Heroes was a match 3 game, where the player had to match three or more tiles or shapes of the same color to score points and defeat enemies on the field. There were five different colored tiles and four of them that could control a character's actions and abilities. The player had to select four characters of different colors (blue, green, red and yellow) in order to battle enemies in an event. Depending on the color of the character, the tiles that were matched determined if a character attacked an opponent. If the player matched three or more tiles of the same color together, it resulted in the hero of that color gaining energy and attacking an enemy of choice. The tiles came in four separate colors (for each color-type); red, green, yellow and blue, as well as purple for boost. Matching purple tiles together increased the multiplier, resulting in the selected heroes becoming stronger. Matching four tiles together created a star tile, while matching six tiles together created another type of Star tile that exploded a piece of the board and activated a different ability. The MAX ability triggered a character's special move.
Dremagen, styling herself as the ""Master of a Thousand Dimensions"", uses her power to take over the universes and timelines across time and space itself.[3] Dremagen is able to clone any existing being at will, which she uses to her advantage by cloning heroes and villains she deems worthy to be part of her ultimate army. Amy Rose finds Ax Battler and asks for his help, though he refuses at first due to feeling too weak to take on Dremagen. Amy is able to convince Ax and the two decide to find Dremagen and defeat her before she takes over the whole universe.
Along the way, Amy and Ax recruit several others to their side, such as Blaze Fielding, AiAi the Monkey, Big the Cat, Beat, Sonic the Hedgehog, Joe Musashi, and Cream the Rabbit. The heroes also discover that Doctor Eggman and his robots have chosen to ally with Dremagen, assisting in her universal conquest.[3] The heroes eventually confront and defeat Dremagen, vanquishing her as she swears vengeance. When the world is not restored to normal, the heroes decide to remain allied and prepare for Dremagen's inevitable return.
The game featured 68 playable characters, all of which were categorized by color. A team had to have included a character from each color; a red, green, blue and yellow hero. Characters were also organized by rarity; common, rare, epic, legendary and captain. Characters featured in the game originated from 15 Sega game franchises:
Sega Heroes received mixed reviews from critics, many praised the gameplay but criticized its difficulty. Bengt Lemne of Game Reactor found the game ""highly addictive"" and felt that the game's need for microtransactions was more balanced than expected[4] Tom Reinert of Galaxy of Geek was more critical, finding the gameplay bland and overly pressuring on players to make in-app purchases due to the slow the process of leveling up characters.[5]

On April 26, 2016, GAMURS acquired esports publication websites eSports-Nation.com, GoldPer10, and eSports.guru.[7] Once the acquisitions were completed, the three platforms were merged, making GAMURS a content provider for titles such as Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Halo 5: Guardians, Hearthstone, and Overwatch.[citation needed] On June 11, GAMURS launched EsportsWikis, an online encyclopedia dedicated to esports.[8] On September 19, it acquired esports news outlet SplitPush.net.[9] On October 28, GAMURS acquired Dot Esports from The Daily Dot.[10][11][12]
On November 9, 2020, GAMURS acquired Pro Game Guides, a source for gaming guides.[13] On June 28, 2021, GAMURS acquired We Got This Covered, a news site for film, TV, comics, and entertainment culture.[14] On November 17, GAMURS acquired the website The Mary Sue, a website intended to highlight women in the ""geek culture space"" and provide a space for minority and underrepresented voices.[15][16]
On January 3, 2022, GAMURS announced the acquisition of Prima Games, a gaming media company.[17] On February 10, it announced the acquisition of Twinfinite, a website focused on video game news, reviews, features, and opinions.[18] On September 30, it confirmed the acquisition of several websites from Enthusiast Gaming, including Destructoid, The Escapist, PC Invasion, and Siliconera.[19] Their firing of The Escapist's editor-in-chief in November resulted in a number of contributors at the website—notably Ben ""Yahtzee"" Croshaw of Zero Punctuation—resigning and forming a new employee-owned outlet.[20][21][22]
In July 2024, an unknown number of employees were laid off across Destructoid, PC Invasion, and Dot Esports.[23]
On 24 September 2024, a second round of lay offs was made, losing about 30 employees due to ""unprecedented shifts"" in the industry, specifically relating to Google's Helpful Content update in 2023 and ""the decline in Google search and Discover traffic across all sites"". Those affected include Dot Esports gaming editor Vic Hood, Dot Esports Australian managing editor Isaac McIntyre, Twinfinite managing editor Tom Hopkins, Destructoid staff writer Jamie Sharp, and PC Invasion senior staff writer Diego Perez.[24]
Additional layoffs took place in February, March, and April 2025. PC enthusiast website PC Invasion was also seemingly shutdown and now redirects to Prima Games.[25]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_of_D,Quest of D,"Quest of D[1] is an arcade game developed by Sega AM2 and published by Sega on the Chihiro arcade board. It is the fifth trading card arcade game by Sega, following World Club Champion Football, Mushiking: The King of Beetles, The Key of Avalon and Love and Berry: Dress Up and Dance!. It is an action-role playing game in a dark fantasy setting and is online enabled similar to previous AM2 titles Virtua Fighter 4 and Sega Network Taisen Mahjong MJ.[2]
The game's story revolves around finding ""D"", the book of evil.[3] The game was updated three times, from 2005 to 2007.[4] Its online features were shut down on the end of August 2010.[5]
The official soundtrack was released in 2006.[6] It was only released in Japan and received no port of any kind. The development team went on to make Shining Force Cross.[7]
The game has two card readers. One is for the IC card that saves progress, and one for the ""D-Force"" cards which are inserted as a deck. At first the player chooses between warrior, magician, priest and then their gender. Two modes are available, scenario and co-op. Scenario is designed for single-player use to start the game to level up and collect items. In co-op mode, nationwide online play is possible with a greater abundance of, and also stronger, enemies. After choosing a dungeon based on the preferred difficulty level, the deck of D-Force cards is inserted, which is obtained beforehand through a vending machine. The deck consists of items and equipment that is put on the character and is found in previous sessions. Up to four players go through a dungeon to fight enemies and collect treasure. The game utilizes an attack button, a guard button and a view button which adjusts the camera. Pushing attack three times does a weak combo, and a strong attack is activated pushing the attack and guard button at the same time. Pushing the attack and view button does a dodge move, while pushing attack, guard and view at once does a powerful surrounding attack that depletes the energy meter. Tapping the attack button while moving activates a run. The touchscreen is used to interact with the game's environments, such as tapping levers and treasure chests. It is also used to interact with the cards displayed at the bottom of the screen. The cards are utilized for magic and skill abilities which are used by pointing at an enemy for an offensive attack, while items that buff or heal player's character are used by dragging the card to the character.[8]
Ver. 2 added three new classes, thief, dwarf and elf. Thief is able to jump and steal as new abilities exclusive to this class. Crafting items has also been made possible. Previously there was only an energy gauge, but now an MP gauge is added. New cards, items and dungeons have been added as well. Dungeons talking place outdoors have also been added for the first time.[9]
For Ver. 3 the existing classes can be upgraded to higher tiers, where for example, the warrior can become a knight and wield dual weapons. Also added were summons, and a score attack. By Ver. 3, the game has reached over 500 collectible D-Force cards in total.[10]
The final version, The Battle Kingdom, added a versus mode where players engage in close range combat and also set up traps. A second upgrade tier for existing classes has also been added.[11]
Quest of D was first revealed during a private show, previously teased as a new game that AM2 has been working on.[12]
The gap between playing online games on PC and arcades was wide, so Quest of D was made to close that gap as much as possible.[13]
The game was mentioned alongside Sangokushi Taisen in a 2005 financial report of Sega as a strong selling arcade title that explores new venues with trading cards and network features.[14]
After a successful run of six years, it was said to be a rare example of a game that was genuinely missed by its community when the online was shut down.[5]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtua_Fighter_(anime),Virtua Fighter (TV series),"Virtua Fighter (Japanese: バーチャファイター, Hepburn: Bācha Faitā) known specifically as Virtua Fighter Animation is a Japanese anime television series based on the Virtua Fighter series of video games made by Sega. Produced by TV Tokyo, Yomiko Advertising and TMS-Kyokuichi, it was directed by Hideki Tonokatsu, with Tsutomu Kamishiro handling series scripts, Ryō Tanaka designing the characters, Satoshi Katō serving as sound director and Kaoru Ōhori composing the music. Targeted towards children aged 6 to 15 years old,[1] the series originally aired on TV Tokyo from October 2, 1995 to June 27, 1996. The episodes take place before the first game in the series, and accordingly portray the characters as slightly younger than they are in the games.[2]
The series follows Akira Yuki and his quest to see the eight stars of heaven after he had gotten overconfident in his Bajiquan skills from his days training with his grandfather. Initially traveling to figure out how to see those stars again, he learns that Sarah Bryant was kidnapped by robotics scientist Eva Durix as part of Eva's quest to create the ""Perfect Soldier."" 
Akira joins up with other characters in his journey such as Pai Chan, Jacky Bryant, Lion Rafale, Kage-Maru and Shun Di to save Sarah.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_kung_fu,Shaolin kung fu,"
Shaolin kung fu (Chinese: 少林功夫; pinyin: Shàolín gōngfū), also called Shaolin Wushu (少林武術; Shǎolín wǔshù), or Shaolin quan (少林拳; Shàolínquán), is the largest and most famous style of kung fu. It combines Mahayana Buddhist, Chan philosophy and martial arts. 
It was developed in the Shaolin Temple in Henan, China during its 1500-year history.[1] In Chinese folklore there is a saying, ""Shaolin kung fu is the best under heaven"", which indicates its superiority among martial arts, and ""All martial arts under heaven originated from Shaolin"", which indicates its influence on other martial arts. The name Shaolin is also used as a brand for the external styles of kung fu. Many styles in southern and northern China use the name Shaolin.[2]

Chinese historical records, like Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue, the Bibliographies in the Book of the Han Dynasty, the Records of the Grand Historian, and other sources document the existence of martial arts in China for thousands of years. For example, the Chinese martial art of wrestling, Shuai Jiao, predates the establishment of Shaolin temple by several centuries.[3] Since Chinese monasteries were large landed estates that made a considerable regular income, monks required some form of protection. Historical discoveries indicate that, even before the establishment of Shaolin temple, monks had been armed and also practiced martial arts.[4] In 1784 the Boxing Classic: Essential Boxing Methods made the earliest extant reference to the Shaolin Monastery as Chinese boxing's place of origin.[5][6] This is, however, a misconception,[7][8] but even the fact that such a mistake could be made helps to show the historical importance of Shaolin kung fu.
In 495 AD, Shaolin temple was built among the Song mountains in Henan province. The first monk who preached Buddhism there was the monk named Buddhabhadra (佛陀跋陀罗; Fótuóbátuóluó), simply called Batuo (跋陀) by the Chinese. There are historical records that Batuo's first Chinese disciples, Huiguang (慧光) and Sengchou (僧稠), both had exceptional martial skills. For example, Sengchou's skill with the tin staff and empty-hand strikes is even documented in the Chinese Buddhist canon.[9]
Bodhidharma is traditionally credited as the transmitter of Chan Buddhism to China, and regarded as its first Chinese patriarch.[10] In Japan, he is known as Daruma.
The idea that Bodhidharma founded martial arts at the Shaolin Temple was spread in the 20th century. However, this idea came from a debunked apocryphal 17th century legend that claimed Bodhidharma  taught the monks philosophies of Chan Buddhism, which the monks were then able to use to create their own combat techniques that developed into Shaolin kung fu. The idea of Bodhidharma influencing Shaolin boxing is based on a Qigong manual written during the 17th century. This is when a Taoist with the pen name 'Purple Coagulation Man of the Way' wrote the Sinews Changing Classic in 1624, but claimed to have discovered it. The first of two prefaces of the manual traces this succession from Bodhidharma to the Chinese general Li Jing via ""a chain of Buddhist saints and martial heroes.""[11]: p165  The work itself is full of anachronistic mistakes and even includes a popular character from Chinese fiction, the 'Qiuran Ke' ('Bushy Bearded Hero') (虬髯客), as a lineage master.[12] Scholar-officials as far back as the Qing dynasty have taken note of these mistakes. The scholar Ling Tinkang (1757–1809) described the author as an ""ignorant village master.""[11]: p168  Even then, the association of Bodhidharma with martial arts only became widespread as a result of the 1904–1907 serialization of the novel The Travels of Lao Ts'an in Illustrated Fiction Magazine:[13]
One of the most recently invented and familiar of the Shaolin historical narratives is a story that claims that the Indian monk Bodhidharma, the supposed founder of Chinese Chan (Zen) Buddhism, introduced boxing into the monastery as a form of exercise around a.d. 525. This story first appeared in a popular novel, The Travels of Lao T'san, published as a series in a literary magazine in 1907. This story was quickly picked up by others and spread rapidly through publication in a popular contemporary boxing manual, Secrets of Shaolin Boxing Methods, and the first Chinese physical culture history published in 1919. As a result, it has enjoyed vast oral circulation and is one of the most ""sacred"" of the narratives shared within Chinese and Chinese-derived martial arts. That this story is clearly a twentieth-century invention is confirmed by writings going back at least 250 years earlier, which mention both Bodhidharma and martial arts but make no connection between the two.[14]: 129  During the short period of the Sui dynasty (581–618), the building blocks of Shaolin kung fu took an official form, and Shaolin monks began to create fighting systems of their own. The 18 methods of Luohan with a strong Buddhist flavour were practiced by Shaolin monks since this time, which was later used to create more advanced Shaolin martial arts. Shaolin monks had developed very powerful martial skills, and this showed itself towards the end of the Sui dynasty.
Like most dynastic changes, the end of the Sui dynasty was a time of upheaval and contention for the throne. The oldest evidence of Shaolin participation in combat is a stele from 728 that attests to two occasions: a defense of the monastery from bandits around 610 and their role in the defeat of Wang Shichong at the Battle of Hulao in 621. Wang Shichong declared himself Emperor. He controlled the territory of Zheng and the ancient capital of Luoyang. Overlooking Luoyang on Mount Huanyuan was the Cypress Valley Estate, which had served as the site of a fort during the Jin and a commandery during the Southern Qi.[15] Emperor Wen of Sui had bestowed the estate on a nearby monastery called Shaolin for its monks to farm, but Wang Shichong, realizing its strategic value, seized the estate and there placed troops and a signal tower, as well as establishing a prefecture called Yuanzhou.[15] Furthermore, he had assembled an army at Luoyang to march on the Shaolin Temple itself.
The monks of Shaolin allied with Wang's enemy, Li Shimin, and took back the Cypress Valley Estate, defeating Wang's troops and capturing his nephew Renze. Without the fort at Cypress Valley, there was nothing to keep Li Shimin from marching on Luoyang after his defeat of Wang's ally Dou Jiande at the Battle of Hulao, forcing Wang Shichong to surrender. Li Shimin's father was the first Tang Emperor and Shimin himself became its second. Thereafter Shaolin enjoyed the royal patronage of the Tang.
Though the Shaolin Monastery Stele of 728 attests to these incidents in 610 and 621 when the monks engaged in combat, it does not allude to martial training in the monastery, or to any fighting technique in which its monks specialized. Nor do any other sources from the Tang, Song and Yuan periods allude to military training at the temple. According to Meir Shahar, this is explained by a confluence of the late Ming fashion for military encyclopedias and, more importantly, the conscription of civilian irregulars, including monks, as a result of Ming military decline in the 16th century.[16]
Stele and documentary evidence shows the monks historically worshiped the Bodhisattva Vajrapani's ""Kinnara King"" form as the progenitor of their staff and bare hand fighting styles.[11]
From the 8th to the 15th centuries, no extant source documents Shaolin participation in combat; then the 16th and 17th centuries see at least forty extant sources attest that, not only did monks of Shaolin practice martial arts, but martial practice had become such an integral element of Shaolin monastic life that the monks felt the need to justify it by creating new Buddhist lore.[16] References to Shaolin martial arts appear in various literary genres of the late Ming:
the epitaphs of Shaolin warrior monks, martial-arts manuals, military encyclopedias, historical writings, travelogues, fiction, and even poetry.[16]
These sources, in contrast to those from the Tang dynasty period, refer to Shaolin methods of combat unarmed, with the spear, and with the weapon that was the forte of the Shaolin monks and for which they had become famous, the staff.[5][16] By the mid-16th century military experts from all over Ming China were travelling to Shaolin to study its fighting techniques.
Around 1560 Yu Dayou travelled to Shaolin Monastery to see for himself its monks' fighting techniques, but found them disappointing. Yú returned to the south with two monks, Zongqing and Pucong, whom he taught the use of the staff over the next three years, after which Zongqing and Pucong returned to Shaolin Monastery and taught their brother monks what they had learned. Martial arts historian Tang Hao traced the Shaolin staff style Five Tigers Interception to Yú's teachings.[citation needed]
The earliest extant manual on Shaolin kung fu, the Exposition of the Original Shaolin Staff Method[17] was written in around 1610 and published in 1621 from what its author Chéng Zōngyóu learned during a more than ten-year stay at the monastery.
Conditions of lawlessness in Henan—where the Shaolin Monastery is located—and surrounding provinces during the late Ming dynasty and all of the Qing dynasty contributed to the development of martial arts.
Meir Shahar lists the martial arts tai chi, Chang Family Boxing, Baguaquan, Xingyi quan and bajiquan as originating from this region and this time period.[16]
From the 1540s to the 1560s, pirates known as wokou raided China's eastern and southeastern coasts on an unprecedented scale.
The geographer Zheng Ruoceng provides the most detailed of the 16th-century sources which confirm that, in 1553, Wan Biao, Vice Commissioner in Chief of the Nanjing Chief Military Commission, initiated the conscription of monks—including some from Shaolin—against the pirates.[16] Warrior monks participated in at least four battles: at the Hangzhou Bay in spring 1553 and in the Huangpu River delta at Wengjiagang in July 1553, Majiabang in spring 1554, and Taozhai in autumn 1555.[16]
The monks suffered their greatest defeat at Taozhai, where four of them fell in battle; their remains were buried under the Stūpa of the Four Heroic Monks (Si yi seng ta) at Mount She near Shanghai.[16]
The monks won their greatest victory at Wengjiagang.[16] On 21 July 1553, 120 warrior monks led by the Shaolin monk Tianyuan defeated a group of pirates and chased the survivors over ten days and twenty miles.[16] The pirates suffered over one hundred casualties and the monks only four.[16]
Not all of the monks who fought at Wengjiagang were from Shaolin, and rivalries developed among them. Zheng chronicles Tianyuan's defeat of eight rival monks from Hangzhou who challenged his command. Zheng ranked Shaolin first of the top three Buddhist centers of martial arts.[16] Zheng ranked Funiu in Henan second and Mount Wutai in Shanxi third. The Funiu monks practiced staff techniques which they had learned at the Shaolin Monastery. The Wutai monks practiced Yang Family Spear (楊家槍; pinyin: Yángjiā qiāng).
There is a famous saying that kung fu trains both the body and mind.
Body building exercises improve body abilities, including flexibility, balance, hardness, power, speed, and control of the body. These exercises are altogether called the 72 arts in the folklore. However the actual exercises are not actually countable.
Combat skills (拳法; quánfǎ) include techniques, tactics, and strategies for barehanded, weapon, and barehanded vs. weapon situations.
Kung fu teaches techniques for both defense and offense. Defensive techniques are mostly four types, dodge, block, catch, and parry, and offensive techniques are feint, hit, lock, and throw. Shaolin kung fu teaches all these types of techniques.
In kung fu, techniques are taught via two-person practices. In these practices, one party attacks and the other defends or counters or stands in posture for the other party to perform the technique. In Shaolin kung fu, in addition, two-person forms are taught. In these two-person forms, attacks and defenses are performed one after the other. Each technique is followed by its counter, and the counter by its counter, and so on. These forms ensure perfect memorization and exact transmission of the techniques from generation to generation.
In addition to techniques, kung fu styles teach tactics. Tactics govern combination of techniques for better results. Because tactics are not specific techniques, they could not specifically be pre-coded into two-person practices and forms. In Shaolin kung fu, tactics are taught via solo forms (套路; tàolù). Every form teaches some related tactics, which altogether shape a strategy. In Shaolin, closely related forms are coupled together, and these couples are called the small and the big forms, like the small and big hong quan, which altogether make the Shaolin hong quan style, and the small and big pao quan, etc. There are also some styles with one form, like taizu chang quan. These styles each teach a unique strategy.
Shaolin kung fu includes hundreds of extant styles. There is recorded documentation of more than a thousand extant forms, which makes Shaolin the biggest school of martial art in the world. In the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), Shaolin monks chose 100 of the best styles of Shaolin kung fu. Then they shortlisted the 18 most famous of them. However, every lineage of Shaolin monks have always chosen their own styles. Every style teaches unique methods for fighting (散打; sàndǎ) and keeping health via one or a few forms. To learn a complete system, Shaolin monks master a number of styles and weapons. The most famous styles of Shaolin kung fu are:
and many other styles.
Huang Zongxi described martial arts in terms of Shaolin or ""external"" arts versus Wudang or internal arts in 1669.[18] It has been since then that Shaolin has been popularly synonymous for what are considered the external Chinese martial arts, regardless of whether or not the particular style in question has any connection to the Shaolin Monastery. Some say that there is no differentiation between the so-called internal and external systems of the Chinese martial arts,[7][19] while other well-known teachers hold the opinion that they are different. For example, the Taijiquan teacher Wu Jianquan:
Those who practice Shaolinquan leap about with strength and force; people not proficient at this kind of training soon lose their breath and are exhausted. Taijiquan is unlike this. Strive for quiescence of body, mind and intention.[20]Some lineages of karate have oral traditions that claim Shaolin origins.[21] Martial arts traditions in Japan,
Korea, Sri Lanka and certain Southeast Asian countries cite Chinese influence as transmitted by Buddhist monks.[22][23]
Recent developments in the 20th century such as Shorinji Kempo (少林寺拳法) practised in Japan's Sohonzan Shorinji (金剛禅総本山少林寺) still maintains close ties with China's Song Shan Shaolin Temple due to historic links.[24] Japanese Shorinji Kempo Group received recognition in China in 2003 for their financial contributions to the maintenance of the historic edifice of the Song Shan Shaolin Temple.[25]
Several films have been produced, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s, about Shaolin kung fu, including The 36th Chamber of Shaolin, The Shaolin Temple, and Shaolin Wooden Men. Modern films include Shaolin Soccer and Shaolin.[citation needed]
Shaolin has influenced numerous rappers, notably the members of Wu-Tang Clan.
Shaolin kung fu is one of the styles used by Mortal Kombat protagonist Liu Kang. His Pao Chui, Choy Lay Fut, Monkey Fist, and Dragon moves derive from Shaolin kung fu.[26]
Shaolin monks (referred to simply as ""monks"" in-game) appear in the roguelike game NetHack, along with samurai. They are one of the two roles to use martial arts skills, with monks having the most powerful martial arts skills in the game.
In the Nickelodeon animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender, the practice of ""firebending"" is based on Shaolin moves.
The ABC TV series Kung Fu (1972–1975) stars David Carradine as a 19th century fugitive Shaolin monk traveling the Western United States in search of his brother. This series helped to popularize Shaolin kung fu with the general American TV audience.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonetta,Bayonetta,"Bayonetta (Japanese: ベヨネッタ, Hepburn: Beyonetta) is an urban fantasy action-adventure game franchise created by Hideki Kamiya. It is developed by PlatinumGames, owned by Sega, and, since the release of Bayonetta 2 in 2014, published by Nintendo. The franchise was introduced in 2009 with Bayonetta, which was followed by two sequels, Bayonetta 2 (2014) and Bayonetta 3 (2022), as well as a prequel, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon (2023). The games follow the titular character, a witch who wields dual pistols, shooters in her high heels, and long, magically transforming hair which becomes a supernatural weapon. The series has been met with strong critical reception, is considered PlatinumGames' flagship series, and is one of Sega's most well-known franchises.
The first game in the series was directed by Hideki Kamiya, who created the Devil May Cry and was involved with the Ōkami franchise while he was working with Capcom. It was the third title in Platinum's four-game contract with Sega. The game was released on October 29, 2009, in Japan,[1] and was released worldwide in January 2010 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The game received generally positive reviews upon release.[2] More than 1.35 million units of the game were shipped.[3] Although it was Platinum's most commercially successful game at that time, the company was disappointed with its sales.[4] A 4K remastered version of the game featuring anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering, SSAO lighting, scalable texture and shadow quality, and more was released on PC in April 2017.[5] The game was ported to Nintendo Switch in 2018,[6] and was bundled alongside Vanquish for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in February 2020.[7]
Bayonetta 2 was announced in 2012 during a Nintendo Direct for the Wii U. The decision received backlash from fans, since the game would not be available on other platforms.[8] Platinum was initially working with Sega to create the sequel, but Sega decided to cancel the game during the game's development. Nintendo subsequently revived the project. According to producer Atsushi Inaba, the game would not have been possible if they did not get the funding and the support from Nintendo. Sega remained as the game's consultant.[9][10] The game was directed by Yusuke Hashimoto, and Kamiya has a supervision role.[11] The game was released in 2014 to very positive reviews. While sales for the Wii U version have not been fully disclosed, by March 2018, Nintendo confirmed the Switch version had sold 400,000 copies during its first nine weeks, compared to the 300,000 copies the Wii U version sold during the same period. As of December 2021, the Switch version has sold 1.04 million copies worldwide.[12]
A third game in the series was announced by Nintendo at The Game Awards 2017. A gameplay trailer was shown at the September Nintendo Direct 2021. It was released for the Nintendo Switch on October 28, 2022, and opened with positive reviews from both critics and fans.[13] The game went on to win Best Action Game at the Game Awards 2022.[14] The game also features a playable teaser for Cereza and the Lost Demon as a secret level and unlocks a special skin once found.
A prequel companion game to Bayonetta 3, focusing on Cereza as a young girl, was announced by Nintendo at The Game Awards 2022. It was released on Nintendo Switch on March 17, 2023.[15]
Bayonetta appears as a downloadable character in Sega's multiplayer fighting game Anarchy Reigns, and as a special guest character alongside Jeanne and Rodin in Nintendo's action game The Wonderful 101.[16][17] She also appears as a downloadable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, and as an unlockable character in the sequel Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Both games also feature a stage based on the falling Umbra Clock Tower which appeared in both Bayonetta games. Rodin was also added as an Assist Trophy in Ultimate.[18][19][20]
An action/shooter 16-bit-style browser game called ""8-Bit Bayonetta"" was released on February 16, 2015, and later on Steam on March 31, 2017.[21]
An anime film based on the first game, titled Bayonetta: Bloody Fate, was produced by Gonzo and released in 2013 in workings with Sega.[22]
In 2014, Udon Entertainment released a book titled The Eyes of Bayonetta, which included a list of her abilities.
Bayonetta, Bayonetta 2, and Bayonetta 3 all received generally positive reviews from critics according to review aggregator Metacritic. Bayonetta 2 was nominated for Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2014, though it ultimately lost to Dragon Age: Inquisition.[34]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor_(video_game_series),Medal of Honor (video game series),"
Medal of Honor is a series of first-person shooter video games created by American film director and producer Steven Spielberg.[1] The first game, Medal of Honor, was developed by DreamWorks Interactive and published by Electronic Arts for the PlayStation in 1999. It spawned a series of follow-up games including multiple expansions spanning various console platforms and PCs.
The first twelve installments take place during World War II, as does the fifteenth. The main characters are usually elite members of Office of Strategic Services (OSS), while some of the later games focus on modern warfare. The concept, story, and executive production of the first three games was made by Spielberg, who later sold the franchise for Electronic Arts in February 2000. The music in the franchise was composed by Michael Giacchino, Christopher Lennertz and Ramin Djawadi.
The series began in 1999 with Medal of Honor. The game was developed by DreamWorks Interactive, when at the time the studio and series were jointly owned by DreamWorks SKG and Microsoft Games, with the game concept and story created by filmmaker Steven Spielberg. The game was released for the PlayStation on October 31, 1999.[2] Spielberg's inspiration for the series emerged while directing and producing the World War II film Saving Private Ryan to create a game that can concurrently be an educational and entertaining experience.[3][4]
In 2000, Medal of Honor: Underground, the sequel, was released for the PlayStation and Game Boy Advance. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, the third game, was developed by 2015, Inc. and released for the PC, Mac OS X and Linux in January 2002. Allied Assault has expansion packs titled Spearhead (2002) and Breakthrough (2003). Fourth entry Medal of Honor: Frontline was developed and released for the PlayStation 2 in May 2002 and the GameCube and Xbox in November 2002. It was later remastered in high-definition and released in 2010 with the PlayStation 3 version of Medal of Honor (2010), the first game in the rebooted series. Medal of Honor: Rising Sun, the fifth game, was released for PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube in 2003 (a planned sequel was cancelled due to the game's mixed reviews). The sixth game, Medal of Honor: Infiltrator, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault, the seventh entry, was released for the PC, Mac OS X and Linux in 2004. It was followed by Medal of Honor: European Assault, the eighth game, which was released for PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube in 2005.
Medal of Honor: Heroes, a spin-off and the ninth game in the series, was developed and released for the PlayStation Portable in 2006. Medal of Honor: Vanguard, the tenth entry, was released for the PlayStation 2 and Wii in 2007. It was the first Medal of Honor game to be released on the Wii console. Medal of Honor: Airborne, the eleventh game in the series, was developed and released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC September 4, 2007; it was the first game in the series to be nonlinear. Twelfth entry Medal of Honor: Heroes 2 was released for the Wii and PlayStation Portable on November 13, 2007. It was a sequel of the first game in spin-off Heroes series.
The thirteenth game in the series, Medal of Honor (2010), was announced in 2008 as Medal of Honor: Operation Anaconda. The game was developed by Danger Close Games, a video game development team formerly known as EA Los Angeles merged in 2008. Medal of Honor (2010) was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC on October 12, 2010.[5][6] Its multiplayer component was developed by the creators of the Battlefield franchise. It is the first Medal of Honor game to be set in the modern day rather than during World War II. Medal of Honor received generally positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success.[7] Medal of Honor: Warfighter, the fourteenth installment in the series and the direct sequel to the 2010 game, was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC on October 23, 2012.[8] The game's storyline was written by real U.S. Tier 1 Operators, inspired by actual events. It is the first game in the series to run on EA Digital Illusions CE's Frostbite 2 game engine. Warfighter was both a critical and commercial failure. In January 2013, COO Peter Moore of Electronic Arts announced that the Medal of Honor series was taken out of rotation due to the poor reception and sales of Medal of Honor: Warfighter.[9] On September 25, 2019, Respawn Entertainment announced Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond for Oculus VR titled at the Oculus Connect 6 conference.[10]
The gameplay originally focuses on the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), an American espionage organization during World War II, placing emphasis on using false papers and silenced pistols, but as the series and the technology has progressed, it has shifted emphasis towards front-line combat. Since the release of Medal of Honor: Rising Sun the series has focused on providing a more open-ended element to the games, allowing the player to have more options in each level instead of a linear path. The violence, up to Medal of Honor: Rising Sun is bloodless and simple, usually consisting of elaborate animations, while the violence in Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault and onward contains the occasional sprays of blood.
The games have received negative, mixed, and positive reviews, with the most acclaimed title in the series being the 1999 Medal of Honor.[11] As of 2016, the series sold over 39 million copies, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time.
Guinness World Records awarded the Medal of Honor series with a world record for Best-selling FPS franchise in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008.
Colette, a short documentary included in the gallery mode for Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject at the 93rd Academy Awards. Though not mentioned by name in the Academy citation, Medal of Honor is arguably the first video game series ever to receive an Oscar for its content.[41]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballyhoo_(video_game),Ballyhoo (video game),"Ballyhoo is an interactive fiction game designed by Jeff O'Neill and published by Infocom in 1985.[1] The circus-themed game was released for ten systems, including MS-DOS, Atari ST, and Commodore 64. Ballyhoo was labeled as ""Standard"" difficulty.[1] It is Infocom's nineteenth game.
The player's character is bedazzled by the spectacle of the circus and the mystery of the performer's life. After attending a show of Tomas Munrab's ""The Travelling Circus That Time Forgot"", the player loiters near the tents instead of rushing through the exit. Maybe some clowns will practice a new act, or perhaps at least one of the trapeze artists will trip...
Instead, the player overhears a strange conversation. The circus' owner has hired a drunken, inept detective to find his daughter Chelsea, who has been kidnapped. Munrab is convinced that it was an outside job; surely his loyal employees would never betray him like this!
As the player begins to investigate the abduction, it soon becomes clear that the circus workers don't appreciate the intrusion. Their reactions range from indifference to hostility to attempted murder. In order to unravel the mystery, the player engages in a series of actions straight out of a circus fan's dream: dressing up as a clown, walking the high wire, and taming lions.
Ballyhoo included the following physical items in the package:[2]
Compute!'s Gazette in 1986 called Ballyhoo ""richly evocative, often exasperating, and very clever"". The magazine approved of the splendid feelies and ""surprisingly flexible"" parser.[3]
The Lost Treasures of Infocom bundled 20 Infocom releases, including Ballyhoo. This package as shipped lacked some information necessary to complete the game; the final page of the souvenir program was omitted. This page was an ad for a classical music radio station; at one point in the game, the player must tune a radio to the frequency listed in the ad (AM 1170) in order to proceed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_Kings,Knockout Kings,"Knockout Kings is a series of boxing video games produced by EA Sports for various platforms yearly between 1998 and 2003, and was replaced by the Fight Night series in 2004.
Before releasing the first Knockout Kings, Electronic Arts released its first 3D boxing game, Foes of Ali, for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in 1995. While there are a few similarities between the two games, Foes of Ali was developed by a different team, Gray Matter, and as such, is not regarded as a precursor.
The duration of a round can be adjusted to either 90 seconds or 3 minutes. In the game's ""slugfest"" mode, fighters can knock each other out at any given moment of the fight, or suffer 6 or 7 knockdowns and still last for the whole fight. There are several differences between Knockout Kings, Knockout Kings 2000, and Knockout Kings 2001 in particular, the most notable being the graphics.
In Knockout Kings, the boxer sprites, although distinctive, are not facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last only up to 10 rounds and not for 12 as in real life or 15 as in the past. In between rounds, all that is seen is a ring-card girl. In Career Mode, user created fighters fight all the way up the ladder, defeating the top contenders and eventually defeating the champion. After beating the title holder, the new champion defends the championship multiple times until retirement. A created boxer can fight in Career Mode and Slugfest Mode, but not in Exhibition mode. Although there is a training mode within Career Mode, it is extremely basic. However, 2 aspects that Knockout Kings has which the sequels lack is that the referee does a mandatory eight-count when a fighter is knocked down whereas in the sequels the referee stops the count immediately after a fighter gets up from a knockdown, and, in Career Mode, the result of a fight is afterwards seen on the screen as front-page newspaper headlines.
The Knockout Kings game series gives users a chance to compete against numerous real fighters, such as Muhammad Ali, Eric Esch, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta, Roberto Durán, Alexis Argüello, and Ray Mancini. Fake amateur boxing legends, such as Daryl ‘Hotcakes’ McGee, The Great Smokey Maggard, Boto Bondingo, and Flute Top Terry, could also be unlocked by gaining certain achievements.
In Knockout Kings 2000 for the PS, the boxer sprites are for the first time facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last up to 15 rounds. Sound and Music volume can also be adjusted in Option Mode. In between rounds, users may see either a ring-card girl, a replay of a part of the previous round, or the boxer the user is representing sitting at his corner together with the statistics so far of the bout. Injury to the face of boxers can also be recognized, as well as his mouth-piece flying out if he is hit by a hard punch. A created boxer in Career Mode can now fight in all modes. The training mode within Career Mode is more specific. Users can now control their boxer while he is training and, in the PS version, users can also choose the location of a gym. Each boxer in the PS version can also be seen entering into the ring just before the bout takes place. There is also a new Mode where the player can see the statistics and biography of all the real-life boxers in the game, and another mode in which the player can re-live famous classic bouts. The user-interface and intro-theme of the PS version is different from the N64 version and there are also more boxers, while the graphics on each version are similar.
Knockout Kings 2001 features many well known boxers such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Rocky Marciano, Michael Grant, Lennox Lewis, Joe Louis, and Jack Dempsey. It also features arenas such as Caesars Palace, Madison Square Garden, Wembley Arena, and the Roman Coliseum, among others.
Knockout Kings 2001 is largely considered the best boxing game on the original PlayStation. In Japan, Famitsu gave the PS2 version a score of 30 out of 40.[1]
Knockout Kings 2001 contains the same improvements as Knockout Kings 2000 and adds more. Whereas fighters in KO Kings and KO Kings 2000 are either ""boxer"" or ""slugger"" style fighters, the styles of fighters in KO Kings 2001 are either ""boxer"", ""slugger"", ""freestyle"", or ""crab"", and these differences of style are very noticeable during bouts. Commentary in KO Kings 2001 is also far more vocal than its predecessors. During Career Mode, a boxing trainer trainer will occasionally talk and give users advice in between rounds as the bout progresses. A fighter in Career Mode is made to retire after winning the title and defending it for several times. KO Kings 2001 is also the first game of the series to introduce CPU vs CPU bouts and ""fantasy match-ups"" between famous boxers of different eras, and the first to introduce women's boxing, which is accessible in Exhibition Mode. The PS and PS2 versions of Knockout Kings 2001 are virtually identical.
Knockout Kings 2002 changes many concepts of its predecessors, e.g. users have to progress through a number of bouts in order to unlock new fighters.
The final game of Knockout Kings, is Knockout Kings 2003 developed by GameFlow Entertainment and EA Redwood Studios. It was released exclusively on GameCube in 2002.
After Knockout Kings 2003, the name of the series was replaced by Fight Night (EA video game series).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lands_of_Lore:_Guardians_of_Destiny,Lands of Lore: Guardians of Destiny,"Lands of Lore: Guardians of Destiny[a] is a 1997 action role-playing game, second installment of the Lands of Lore series, a sequel to Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos. It brought about a drastic change in gameplay style from its predecessor, opting away from the original's D&D turn-based style in favor of more action elements. A sequel, Lands of Lore III, was released in 1999.
Similar to its contemporary Realms of the Haunting, Guardians of Destiny is a first-person adventure game which, while featuring occasional combat, revolves around the solving of puzzles. Like in most adventure games, the player can interact with objects and people by clicking on them, collect items into an inventory, and use items from their inventory on environmental objects. However, some puzzles also require the player to cast spells, use their melee attack, or drag objects and even enemy corpses into specific locations.
Navigating through the environment also often involves platforming challenges, some of which can be undertaken only in one specific form. The player character, Luther, has a curse which causes him to randomly change between three forms: human, lizard, and beast. Later in the game the player acquires spells which can be used to change form at will if in human or lizard form; once in beast form Luther must wait to change randomly back to human form, since the beast cannot cast spells. The lizard form is small, allowing it to enter tunnels inaccessible to other forms, but preventing it from crossing even shallow streams of water without drowning. It can run faster and cast spells more easily than other forms. The beast form is tall and heavy, such that it can make only mild jumps, but in some places its size allows it to step across gaps that the other two forms would have to jump over, wade across the deepest body of water, it's also immune to poison and very strong. The human form is an average of the other two in most respects, but is the only form which can equip weapons or armor.
Combat works similarly to The Throne of Chaos, except that the player's party consists of just one character, and most enemies will not attack the player character unless provoked. Luther can use a melee attack, fire a bow at range, use items, and cast spells at four different levels. Each spell has a fifth level which is only usable if Luther consumes an ancient stone or has acquired the Mantle of the Ancients, which occurs at a set point near the end of the game. Spells draw on a limited pool of magic points, which, like Luther's health, is gradually recovered over time.
The plot follows Luther, son of Scotia, who is imprisoned by the soldiers of Gladstone and accused for being a member of the Dark Army. Luther is cursed to be morphed into either a monster or a lizard, thanks to which he manages to escape. While the Draracle guides him, Dawn and Baccata (from the previous game) initially chase, and later aid him. Luther must go on his quest while avoiding his many pursuers.
The player controls Luther on his quest to solve the curse. Randomly he will change forms, gaining the respective advantages (higher strength with the beast, or increased magical ability and the opportunity to enter small spaces and discover secret areas with the lizard). The power to change forms willingly is eventually bestowed upon the player in the game.
There are a myriad of locations to explore. They include, but are not limited to, the Draracle's Caves, the Draracle's Museum, the Huline Jungle, the Savage Jungle, The Dracoid Cemetery and Ruins, the Claw Mountains, the Huline Temple, the Ruloi Citadel, and the wondrous City of the Ancients.
The player can choose between two branches, good or evil, which then evolve into seven possible endings. Endings include when Luther loses the final battle with Belial and the land is overrun with nasties, when ""good"" Luther triumphs and the Draracle discovers Luther in bed with Dawn, and when ""bad"" Luther triumphs, shown from behind raining destruction on the land as a powerful god. Other endings include not being quick enough to escape from the Armory in Belial's Laboratory, which shows Belial smiting the Huline Village with an energy blast, being killed by the Draracle when Luther kills Belial on the Evil ending branch, and being seduced and killed by Dawn before the fight with Belial if the player acted badly towards her during the game. Going to the entrance of the starting cave a second time, at the beginning of the cave results in being killed by the soldiers stationed there, a different cinematic can play, depending on the form Luther is current in at the time of his death.
Because role-playing titles such as The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall had recently attained commercial hit status, Westwood opted to ""make Lands of Lore 2 one of its flagship titles for the latter half of 1997"", according to Next Generation.[4]
The game received above-average reviews. Keith Sullivan of PC Gamer US called it a ""very good game"", but stated that its engine was dated in comparison to Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II and Quake.[13] Cindy Yans of Computer Games Strategy Plus commended its ""excellent"" storyline and the characters, and a ""rich"" world to explore, but was critical to its full-motion video sequences, ""awkward"" controls and ""dated"" graphics engine.[8]
A reviewer for Next Generation called Lands of Lore a worthy sequel, but also as part RPG, part adventure. The writer concluded that, while the game ""may have its quirks"", it is ""an entertaining romp"" for those willing to overlook the issues.[11] In PC PowerPlay, David Wildgoose hailed it as ""perhaps the most complete game"" he had played and praised its mixture of genres. He believed that it was ""a new level"" of quality for Westwood.[14]
PC Zone's Jamie Cunningham called the game ""another Westwood masterpiece"" while acknowledging some issues in the gameplay.[15] Andy Backer of Computer Game Entertainment summarized the game as ""flawed"" and ""frustrating"" but ""brilliant"" at the same time.[16] Writing for PC Gamer UK, Andy Butcher said that the game offers hours of fun despite its ""patchy"" nature and ""uninspiring"" graphics.[12]
In a negative review, Computer Gaming World's Scorpia called the game a ""horror"" and considered not an RPG, adventure or an action game, but a ""patchwork"" of all three.[17]
The game claimed #11 in the U.S. on PC Data's computer game sales rankings for October 1997.[18][19] A writer for CNET Gamecenter noted that the game was part of a trend of role-playing successes that month, alongside Ultima Online and Fallout.[18] The game was absent from PC Data's top 20 by November.[20]
On Media Control's computer game sales charts for the German market, the game debuted in second place in the latter half of October.[21] Holding this position in the first half of November, it proceeded to chart in the top 10 through the end of 1997.[22][23] During 1998, the game remained in the top 20 through the end of February,[24][25] and placed 40th and 45th in May. At that time, it had maintained an unbroken 28-week streak in the top 50.[26][27]
During the inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards, Guardians of Destiny was a finalist for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' ""PC Role-Playing Game of the Year"" award,[28] which ultimately was given to Dungeon Keeper.[29] It was also nominated for the ""Best RPG"" award at the CNET Gamecenter Awards for 1997, which went to Diablo;[30] and was a runner-up for Computer Gaming World's 1997 ""Strategy Game of the Year"" award, which ultimately went to Fallout.[31] The game won the award for ""RPG"" at PC PowerPlay's 1997 Game of the Year Awards.[32]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icewind_Dale:_Heart_of_Winter,Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter,"Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter is a 2001 expansion pack to the role-playing video game Icewind Dale, developed by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay Entertainment. It introduced many changes and additions to the original game, and included a new campaign. A downloadable add-on to this expansion pack, titled Trials of the Luremaster, was released for free. Both the expansion and add-on were included in Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition.
Some notable changes include a much higher experience point cap, new magical items and spells, a special ""Heart of Fury"" difficulty setting for increased enemy power and higher experience point-gain, and a maximum resolution of 800x600.[1][2] The game is still based on the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition ruleset.
In order to access the new campaign, the player must either enter a previously locked door in the town of Kuldahar while possessing a party of characters level 9 or above or import the party after completing the main campaign, when the party is exported.
In Kuldahar, the player's characters are greeted by a barbarian shaman, Hjollder, who reveals that he has visions of a great conflict and that the party is the key to stopping it. The party is magically transported to Lonelywood, where they discover that a great barbarian force is gathering nearby, threatening to destroy the Ten Towns. The force has rallied to Wylfdene, a great barbarian warlord killed in battle the previous season. He claims to be host to the spirit of the ancient barbarian hero Jerrod and is now eager to strike the Ten Towns in the name of the war-god Tempus.[1]
The party journeys to the barbarian camp and meets the resurrected chief himself. Hjollder believes that something is off with Wylfdene, and is in turn exiled from the camp. The party later finds the exiled Hjollder in the barbarian burial grounds Wylfdene rose from, though it is now plagued by undead and spirits. On his recommendation, the party journeys to the Gloomfrost to consult the Seer, an old woman with vast mystical powers. She reveals that it is not Jerrod who inhabits the body of Wylfdene, but rather the soul of great white dragon Icasaracht.
The party returns to the barbarian camp, where the Seer herself approaches Wylfdene. She is killed by him, but succeeds in tricking the dragon spirit into abandoning his body, revealing the deception to the gathered barbarians. The last task of the player's party is to journey to the Sea of Moving Ice where Icasaracht's Lair is located. There, they battle through her minions (including the remaining loyal barbarians, trolls and sahuagins) and ultimately find the white dragon herself. She explains she wished vengeance upon the Ten Towns for the seizure of dragonkind's lands, and for her death a century past.
She claims she saw a kindred spirit in Wylfdene and sympathized with the barbarians, who she claims face extinction from the encroaching Ten Towns. She had thought they would be fitting instruments for her plan. The party kills her, and shatters the Soul Stone that had saved her from death a century before, ensuring her death is final.
Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter was announced on September 25, 2000, shortly before the release of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.[3] By that time, the expansion had been in full production for between one and two months.[4] Designer Josh Sawyer said that the impetus for the project was the strong retail performance of Icewind Dale; Interplay greenlit Heart of Winter around two weeks after the launch of the original game.[5] The team began work ""immediately"", Sawyer wrote, as there was ""a limited amount of time to work on the project and we needed to sharply define exactly what we wanted to accomplish.""[6]
Producer Darren Monahan said that the team ""included a lot of fan feedback, particularly relating to the balances of each of the classes in the original game."" Another focus lay on importing code and features created for Baldur's Gate II to the Icewind Dale series.[7] One of the development challenges was the straightforward and linear structure of the original Icewind Dale, which left little room for additional content. The team's solution was to take players to a separate region by using the barbarian Hjollder as a ""catalyst character"", who could be met either in Icewind Dale's hub location of Kuldahar or after completing the game's main story.[8] Team members John Deiley and Steve Bokkes handled the ""majority of area and quest work"" in Heart of Winter, according to Sawyer.[9]
Heart of Winter went gold on February 12, 2001.[10] It shipped to retailers on February 20.[11] The expansion was released in Europe on March 23, 2001.[12][13]
Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter received fairly positive reviews,[14][15] with multiple reviewers complimenting its new features and areas.[1][19][20]  According to GameSpy, the writer suggests that ""when the entire Icewind Dale saga is available at bargain prices, this expansion marks a fun portion of the entire game"".[21]
Chris Glassel of the Dallas Morning News and Greg Kasavin of GameSpot criticized the game for the length of its campaign, which was much shorter than the original.[2][19] Chris Chan of the New Straits Times called out a number of minor technical glitches, such as pathfinding problems and the occasional system lock up.[1]
Heart of Winter debuted at #6 on NPD Intelect's computer game sales rankings for the February 18–24 period.[22] It fell to 10th place in its second week,[23] and climbed back to ninth in its third week.[24] After four weeks, Heart of Winter was absent from NPD's top 10.[25]
In March 2001, Black Isle Studios began development of Trials of the Luremaster, a free, downloadable add-on for Heart of Winter. According to designer Steve Bokkes, the add-on was planned as a small stopgap project to keep members of the Heart of Winter team occupied. Black Isle was working on several games at the time and could not yet commit to another full production.[26] Another inspiration was the criticism that Heart of Winter had been too short.[27] Journalist Mark Asher wrote that he ""talked to Black Isle Director Feargus Urquhart ... and he mentioned that they felt like maybe they should have done a little more with the Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter expansion, so this expansion is their response.""[28]
The add-on was released in early July 2001, with a download size of 72 megabytes.[29] It contains a large dungeon-like location with several new areas to explore, and a handful of new enemies to combat and items to find. It also acts as the game's final patch, fixing a number of bugs and bringing the game's version number up to v1.42.
Trials of the Luremaster received a positive review from Brett Todd of Games Domain, who wrote that it ""represents some of the finest design seen over the breadth of the entire Infinity Engine series from Bioware and Black Isle"", although he noted that some sections ""do feel padded"".[30]
The player meets a mysterious halfling, Hobart Stubbletoes, who introduces himself in the Whistling Gallows Inn in Lonelywood. He seeks a party of stalwart heroes for a quest to a place of great wonder, with treasures beyond the imagination. Should the party accept, they will be transported to a new place, far from the icy terrain of the Ten Towns, finding themselves within the walls of a ruined castle in an unfamiliar land, the Anauroch desert. The Castle itself is a place where a mad spirit of a bard named Luremaster is constantly challenging adventurers with many traps and monsters. The only way out of the place is to defeat all monsters, avoid traps, find good loot if possible, and defeat the Luremaster.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelljammer,Spelljammer,"
Spelljammer is a campaign setting originally published for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd edition) role-playing game, which features a fantastic (as opposed to scientific) outer space environment. Subsequent editions have included Spelljammer content; a Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition setting update was released on August 16, 2022.
Spelljammer introduced into the AD&D universe a comprehensive system of fantasy astrophysics, including the Ptolemaic concept of crystal celestial spheres. Crystal spheres may contain multiple worlds and are navigable using ships equipped with ""spelljamming helms"". Ships powered by spelljamming helms are capable of flying into not only the sky but into space. With their own fields of gravity and atmosphere, the ships have open decks and tend not to resemble the spaceships of science fiction, but instead look more like galleons, animals, birds, fish or even more wildly fantastic shapes.
The Spelljammer setting is designed to allow the usual sword and sorcery adventures of Dungeons & Dragons to take place within the framework of outer space tropes. Flying ships travel through the vast expanses of interplanetary space, visiting moons and planets and other stellar objects.
Like the Planescape setting, Spelljammer unifies most of the other AD&D settings and provides a canonical method for allowing characters from one setting (such as Dragonlance) to travel to another (such as the Forgotten Realms). However, unlike Planescape, it keeps all of the action on the Prime Material Plane and uses the crystal spheres, and the ""phlogiston"" between them, to form natural barriers between otherwise incompatible settings. Though the cosmology is derived largely from the Ptolemaic system of astronomy, many of the ideas owe much to the works of Jules Verne and his contemporaries, and to related games and fiction with a steampunk or planetary romance flavor. A strong Age of Sail flavor is also present.
Shannon Appelcline, in the book Designers & Dragons (2011), highlighted that in 1989 Spelljammer was the first of a host of new campaign settings published by TSR. It was created by Jeff Grubb and ""introduced a universe of magical starships traversing the 'crystal spheres' that contained all the earthbound AD&D campaign worlds. It suggested a method to connect together all of TSR's settings and at the same time introduced fun new Jules Verne-esque technology that had never before been seen in the game. It was innovative and popular"".[1]: 26  Appelcline commented that Spelljammer ""offered a way to connect every single D&D fantasy world, was thus one of the first true crossovers"" in role-playing games.[1]: 219 
The Spelljammer: AD&D Adventures in Space space fantasy boxed set was released in 1989.[2] Several of TSR's other campaign worlds had their own sections in the Spelljammer Boxed Set - Realmspace for the Forgotten Realms, Krynnspace for Dragonlance, and Greyspace for Greyhawk. Along with the new sphere - Clusterspace - they were known as the ""Big Three and Astromundi"". Dark Sun, Ravenloft and Mystara weren't included, as the first two did not fit with the setting and the Mystara only used the D&D rules, not the AD&D rules.[citation needed]
The product line would be expanded with a number of boxed sets and accessories such as Lost Ships (1990),[3] Realmspace (1991)[4] and The Astromundi Cluster (1993). Appelcline commented that The Astromundi Cluster acted as ""a soft reboot of the Spelljammer line"" and was more of setting focused sourcebook than previous Spelljammer books which acted more ""as a conduit between all of the other AD&D settings"".[5] The first adventure module, titled Wildspace, was released in 1990; four connected adventure modules followed it.[6][7] A longer campaign module, Heart of the Enemy, was then published in 1992[8] followed by an adventure anthology, Space Lairs, in 1993.[9]
The monsters of Spelljammer were detailed in two installments of the Monstrous Compendium series, Spelljammer Appendix in 1990 and Spelljammer Appendix II in 1991.[10][11]
In 1993, Space Lairs and The Astromundi Cluster were the final products of the line.[9] Appelcline commented on the end of the setting in the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons era: ""TSR's fifth second-edition campaign world, Planescape (1993), was released to replace Spelljammer, which had just then ended. TSR wanted a new world-spanning setting and Slade Henson came up with the answer by suggesting a new setting built on Jeff Grubb's first-edition Manual of the Planes (1987). [...] Unlike Spelljammer this new setting had a strong geographical centre, the City of Sigil, resolving a flaw in the Spelljammer setting that denied players a good home base"".[1]: 26 
The Spelljammer line of products was discontinued by TSR before they were acquired by Wizards of the Coast in 1997.[12]
In May 2002, Paizo published an article for Spelljammer in Dungeon #92 titled ""Spelljammer: Shadow of the Spider Moon"".[13] Using the D20 system, it provided new rules for firearms and spelljamming, as well as skills, feats and prestige classes. Spelljammer monsters such as neogi and giff were not used. Instead, it featured creatures from the Monster Manual such as drow, formians and yuan-ti.[citation needed]
In May 2005, Wizards of the Coast updated the neogi to the 3.5 edition rules in the supplement Lords of Madness (2005).[14] The book included a chapter with a sample map of a crashed Spelljamming vessel, cultural habits of the neogi, and the monster's stat blocks.[citation needed]
A Spelljammer homage appears in the 4th edition Manual of the Planes;[15] the sourcebook highlights Spelljammer ships as one method of traveling between planes and provides information for in-game use of Spelljammer vessels.[16]
Spelljammer content also appears in the 5th Edition adventure module Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage (2018). In the adventure, a spelljamming ship and its illithid captain appear stranded in level 19 of the titular dungeon.[17][12][18] Then in October 2021, Wizards released the PDF Travelers of the Multiverse which is part of the ""Unearthed Arcana"" public playtest series. Of the six player races it included, four races (autognome, giff, hadozee, and plasmoid) are closely associated with the Spelljammer setting. Both Polygon and Bleeding Cool highlighted that this playtest could indicate a future Spelljammer reboot.[12][18]
Wizards of the Coast released a new boxed set titled Spelljammer: Adventures in Space on August 16, 2022; this release updates the Spelljammer setting for the 5th Edition.[19][20] The box set includes a Dungeon Master's screen, a double-sided poster map and three 64-page hardcover books: Astral Adventurer's Guide (a Dungeon Master guide), Boo's Astral Menagerie (a bestiary), and Light of Xaryxis (an adventure module).[21] A special edition, with cover art by Hydro74, was also released.[20] A prequel adventure module, titled Spelljammer Academy, was released for free on the Wizards of the Coast website and on D&D Beyond in July of the same year.[22][23]
Monstrous Compendium Vol 1: Spelljammer Creatures introduced ten creatures from the Spelljammer setting to the 5th Edition in April 2022.[24][25]
Spelljamming helms are the central setting concept which allow interplanetary and interstellar space travel for vessels which would otherwise not be spaceworthy, in the form of a helm.[26] Any spellcaster may sit on a spelljammer helm to move the ship.[26] The mysterious race known as the Arcane is the sole manufacturer and distributor of spelljamming helms.[26] Within the Dungeons & Dragons universe, they are a method of converting magical energy into motive power.
All bodies of a sufficiently large size have gravity. This gravity usually (but not always) exerts a force equal to the standard gravitational attraction on the surface of an Earth-sized planetary body. Gravity in the Spelljammer universe is also an exceptionally convenient force, and almost always works such that ""down"" orients itself in a manner most humanoids would find sensible.
All bodies of any size carry with them an envelope of air whenever they leave the surface of a planet or other stellar object. Unlike real-world astrophysics, this air envelope is not dispersed by the vacuum of space. These bubbles of air provide breathable atmosphere for varying lengths of time, but 3 months is considered ""standard"".
A crystal sphere (also known as a crystal shell) is a gigantic spherical shell which contains an entire planetary system. Each sphere varies in size but typically they are twice the diameter of the orbit of the planet that is farthest from the sun or planet at the center of the sphere (the system's primary).
The surface of the sphere is called the ""sphere wall"" and separates the void of ""wildspace"" (within the sphere) from the ""phlogiston"" (that surrounds and flows outside the sphere). The sphere wall has no gravity and appears to be impossible to damage by any normal or magical means. Openings in the sphere wall called ""portals"" allow spelljamming ships or wildspace creatures to pass through and enter or exit from a crystal sphere. Portals can spontaneously open and close anywhere on the sphere wall. Magical spells (or magical items that reproduce their effects) can allow a portal to be located. Other magic can open a new portal or collapse an existing one. Ships or creatures passing through a portal when it closes may be cut in two.
Unlike the Ptolemaic system, the crystal spheres are not nested within each other.
Wildspace is similar to the outer space of science fiction, with planets, asteroids and stars, but with different physics.[26] Gravity is either none or the same as that of Earth, and is directed towards the center of planet-sized bodies; on large objects in space like spacecraft and enormous creatures gravity is directed towards a flat plane running through the object's long axis, allowing characters to stand on the decks of ships.[26]
The phlogiston is essentially a big ocean of a unique element that is neither air, fire, water, or earth.[26] The phlogiston (also known as ""the Flow"") is a bright, extremely combustible gas-like medium that exists between the Crystal Spheres. A signature property of the substance is that it does not exist within the boundaries of a crystal sphere, to the degree that it cannot be brought into a crystal sphere by any known means up to and including the direct will of deities. Every crystal sphere floats in the phlogiston, very slowly bobbing up and down over time. Travel between Crystal Spheres is facilitated by the formation of ""Flow rivers"" — sections of the phlogiston which have a current and greatly reduce travel time. Travel through the ""slow flow"" (i.e. off the Flow rivers) is possible, but very dangerous.
The Spelljammer is a legendary ship which looks like a gigantic manta ray,[26] and houses an entire city on its back. All spacefarers (people who live in wildspace) have heard of the Spelljammer but very few have ever seen it themselves. It is this ship that gives its name to ""spelljamming"", ""spelljamming helms"" and anything else connected with spelljamming. The ship has been reported to have been seen in countless spheres for as long as records go back. Even some groundlings (people who live on planets that have very little or no commerce with spelljamming communities) have legends about it. There are hundreds of conflicting legends about this ship, and a mythology has developed about the ship that is similar to the legends surrounding The Flying Dutchman.
As a living thing (although it does not consume any matter, it does absorb heat and light through its ventral (or under) side and uses them to produce air and food for its inhabitants), the Spelljammer has a complex life cycle and means of procreation. Normally the ship has no captain and wanders the cosmos seemingly aimlessly. When the Spelljammer has a captain, obtained through another complex process, it will create Smalljammers (miniature versions of the Spelljammer) that go forth as its spawn. Apparently there can only be one Spelljammer at any one time. One Smalljammer will mature into a full Spelljammer ship if its predecessor is ever destroyed.
Alien races inhabiting the Spelljammer universe included humans, dwarves, xenophobic beholders, rapacious neogi, militant giff (humanoid hippopotami), centaurlike dracons, hubristic elf armadas, spacefaring orcs called ""scro"", mysterious arcane, the Thri-kreen insectoids, and bumbling tinker gnomes. Illithids were another major race, but were presented as more mercantile and less overtly evil than in other D&D settings. The Monstrous Compendium series added many more minor races. The simian Hadozee were also introduced into the setting, and later incorporated into the 3.5 rules in the supplemental book Stormwrack.
Spelljammer has acted as the official campaign setting for multiple Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying adventure modules, sourcebooks and accessories.
Sixteen comics set in the Spelljammer universe were published by DC Comics between September 1990 and November 1991 with the creative team of Barbara Kesel as writer, and Michael Collins, Dan Panosian, and other contributors. The first appearance was in TSR Worlds Annual #1, where the Jammers were introduced in a third of the 72-page book. Two weeks later, their own title went on sale, but both comics have a shelf date of September, 1990.[27][28] Spelljammer comics also uses Jasmine, a winged human character originally introduced from Forgotten Realms comics, as one of the lead characters.[29]
Wizards of the Coast released a soundtrack, titled Spelljams, for Spelljammer: Adventures in Space digitally on August 16, 2022;[30][31][32] each song on the soundtrack corresponds with one of the chapters in the adventure module Light of Xaryxis.[33]
Six novels set in the Spelljammer universe were published by TSR, before TSR was incorporated into Wizards of the Coast. The novels were interconnected and formed ""The Cloakmaster Cycle"". The novels tell the story of Teldin Moore, a 'groundling' farmer on Krynn who has a powerful and apparently cursed magical cloak that was given to him. He then ends up on a quest, which takes him first into wildspace and then away from his home sphere to distant crystal spheres. The series showcases the wonders and perils of the Spelljammer universe. The novels are now out of print.
The only Spelljammer computer game ever produced was Spelljammer: Pirates of Realmspace, published by SSI in 1992.
In 2002 a team of freelance game modification developers created ""The Arcane Space Tileset"" for  Neverwinter Nights.[34] This tileset included Spelljamming ships, space and atmospheric terrains, along with monsters and NPCs, all set within the Spelljammer Campaign setting.
Legends of the Multiverse is an official actual play streaming series broadcast on the Dungeons & Dragons channels which premiered on April 27, 2022 and is set in the Spelljammer campaign setting. It stars Deborah Ann Woll, B. Dave Walters, Gina Darling, Meagan Kenreck, and Todd Kenreck. It will also feature guest stars such as Brennan Lee Mulligan, Aabria Iyengar, Ginny Di, Anna Prosser, Deejay Knight, Emme Montgomery, Travis McElroy, SungWon Cho, and Jim Zub.[35][36]
In the January 1990 edition  of Games International (issue #12), James Wallis was not a fan of the initial release, Spelljammer: AD&D Adventures in Space, finding inconsistencies in the combat rules, saying that the cumulative effect of these inconsistencies is to make space combat unplayable. He did find the background ""imaginative and consistent"", but very little of it. Although he admired the production values of the components, he found the book disorganized to the point of ""disarray and confusion"". He concluded by giving the game a poor rating of only 2 out of 5, saying that ""Spelljammer may score well physically but fails mentally [...] Scavenging AD&D players who enjoy stripping tasty ideas from the carcasses of dying games may find it of interest, but I cannot recommend it to anyone else"".[37]
Alexander Sowa, for CBR in October 2021, commented that Spelljammer should be one of the classic settings Wizards of the Coast brings back for the 5th Edition. Sowa wrote that ""players have been asking for Spelljammer to be introduced to 5e since the release of the first setting sourcebook. Wizards tossed them a bone with the Dream of The Blue Veil spell added in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, but it's not a replacement for the niche Spelljammer previously filled. It's not just a way to travel between different campaign settings; it's a simultaneous fulfillment of sci-fi and fantasy dreams of exploration, venturing deep into unknown depths and contending with the strange and otherworldly"".[38]
Spelljammer was #3 on The Gamer's 2022 ""The 8 Best Dungeons & Dragons Settings Ever"" list — the article states that ""Spelljammer is one of the most unique settings on this list, with endless possibilities brought up in its planet-hopping realms. The Spelljammer setting can almost best be surmised as 'pirates meets sci-fi fantasy' with its blend of magical worlds and galaxy-traversing galleons"".[39] In a separate article for The Gamer, in February 2022, Paul DiSalvo commented that ""while D&D's second edition was home to a wide range of Spelljammer books including several adventure modules, the setting has since faded into obscurity, with it not being prominently featured within the game's third, fourth, and fifth editions"".[40]
In his 2023 book Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground, RPG historian Stu Horvath called the game ""gloriously bewildering."" Horvath also noted the new edition being launched for the 5th edition of D&D, commenting ""I can't imagine something so weird as the original coming out today — the new version already seems different, a little less odd, a little more formulaic.""[41]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Shortcut,Wikipedia:Shortcut,"
A shortcut is a specialized type of redirect page that provides an abbreviated wikilink to an administrative page or one of its sections, usually from the Wikipedia namespace or Help namespace. These shortcuts' abbreviations in all-caps text are commonly used (linked or unlinked) on community pages and talk pages, but should not be used in articles themselves. If there are one or more shortcuts for a page or section, one or more will usually be chosen to be displayed in an information box on the right labelled Shortcut or Shortcuts, as can be seen at the top of this page.
Shortcuts are created for the convenience of editors. It is possible to create a shortcut for any page. The existence of a shortcut does not imply or prove that the linked page is a policy or guideline.
Lists of available shortcuts can be found at:
A Wikipedia shortcut can be entered into the Wikipedia search box to quickly bring you to a project page. For example, you can type WP:R or H:R into the search box and then press the enter key (or click the magnifying glass icon), to get to the Wikipedia:Redirect page, instead of having to type in the complete phrase. 
Alternatively, you can use a shortcut in the URL in your browser's address bar. For example, you are currently viewing the Wikipedia:Shortcut page. The URL for this page is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Shortcut. You could then get from here to the Wikipedia:Redirect page by replacing Wikipedia:Shortcut with WP:R in the address bar, followed by pressing the enter key. (If your browser has relative URL entry, simply prefix the shortcut with ./ instead of having to edit the existing URL.)
Shortcuts are presented in all capital letters (ALL CAPS); however, the search box is case-insensitive. For example, in the search box, you can type wp:r, instead of WP:R. However, when using the URL method (or when making links) it is necessary to match the capitalization of the shortcut itself.
As explained below, only the most common and easily remembered shortcuts should appear in link boxes.
Shortcuts are often used on talk pages in their abbreviated form, decreasing readability for the general reader. For example, some editors are familiar with the bulk of the most common Wikipedia namespace shortcuts, recognizing what they stand for on sight. Others, however, are faced with pages full of incomprehensible jargon, the meaning of which is not immediately clear. Shortcuts also are sometimes (ab)used to make a WP:POINT, best described by WP:WOTTA.
To avoid these problems, a good practice when creating shortcuts is to choose common English words that are easily identifiable and memorable. Another good practice is to be mindful of the general reader and use meaningful terms when citing an obscure shortcut. For example, the piped link [[WP:SHC|shortcut]] gives readers an idea of the subject of the target page, while the bare abbreviation [[WP:SHC]] is unintelligible to those unfamiliar with the term.
It should also be remembered that shortcuts are a convenience, not a substitute for titles. Shortcuts should not appear in ""See also"" sections, hatnotes or any other place where a page title is expected.
At the top of many pages, such as those on policies and guidelines, there are small link boxes listing the names of the page's shortcuts. These boxes can be added to a page by placing the template {{Shortcut|WP:X}} (for project namespace), {{Shortcut|H:X}} (for Help pages), or {{Shortcut|MOS:X}} (for the Manual of Style), at the top of the page's text. They can also be placed below a section header or inline within the page content, to link to a specific section or paragraph; in these cases, the boxes are placed above other templates such as {{See also}} and {{Main}}.
Policy and guideline pages with shortcuts pointing to them typically use {{Guideline|WP:X}}, such as on this page, instead of the shortcut template {{Shortcut}}. Another frequently used template is: {{MoS-guideline|MOS:X}}. For template redirects, {{Template shortcut}} is used instead.
The point of these template boxes is not to list every single redirect for any given page (that's what Special:WhatLinksHere is for). Instead, they generally should list only the most common and easily remembered redirects.  One way to check which is the most common is through the Pageviews tool (replace the examples with the shortcuts you are testing).
To learn more about the different shortcut box templates and their functions, see the documentation for the {{shortcut}} template. Among other things, anchors are added automatically and there are options for making boxes flow to the left.
Shortcut names are almost always in uppercase. A shortcut is typically named using the following convention:
In the above form, the prefix is typically one of the prefixes in the following section, and the suffix is an acronym or abbreviation of the redirect target.  However quite a lot are simply WP:BAD.
If the target is a sub-page, the following conventions are common (where 'Y' is an additional sequence of uppercase characters or numerals):
Shortcuts that do not follow the above naming convention are discouraged, and are typically deleted.
The directory of shortcuts contains several conflicts for prefixes of subpages, often caused by a shortcut being 're-targeted' (modified to point to a new target page) without the shortcuts to subpages also being re-targeted.
Before creating a shortcut, use Special:PrefixIndex to ensure that the same prefix is not being used for different purposes.  e.g. WP:CJ has several existing uses.  No additional confusion would be caused by creating a shortcut WP:CJQ, however creating a shortcut WP:CJ/Q would be adding to the existing mess.  There is a long-standing feature request to resolve shortcut subpages automatically. (See T14980.)
Prefixes that shouldn't be used for other purposes include:
Other prefixes that have become common for a set of pages include:
The following namespace aliases are automatically translated by the Wikipedia servers.
They are case-insensitive (so wp: or wP: or Wp: have the same meaning as WP:).  For example, both WP:TS and wp:TS link directly to Wikipedia:TS. 
One unique feature of the WP: alias is its utility in searching for the vast number of project pages. This is because most project pages outside the Wikipedia namespace, will have a redirect for the Wikipedia namespace prefix appended to their title and the same for most major shortcuts to them (e.g., Help:Watchlist, with the shortcut H:W, has redirects at Wikipedia:Watchlist and at WP:W. Thus, by extension, most project pages may be found by searching using the WP: alias alone, e.g. WP:Name. For more, see Help:WP search protocol.
When the shortcut does not use one of the namespace aliases listed above (WP or WT), it is a cross-namespace redirect and is case-sensitive.
However, when a prefix is used by multiple shortcuts, and has broad community support, it is referred to as a pseudo-namespace to distinguish these shortcuts from other cross-namespace redirects. (Note that the term ""pseudo-namespace"" is also used to refer to namespaces without content that are provided by the MediaWiki software and extensions, such as Special:, Media:, Feedback:)
The following prefixes may be used freely for the target listed:
Other prefixes do not enjoy the same level of community support.  It is disputed whether they should be deemed to be pseudo-namespaces.
The following prefix is for used for limited or specific uses only:
The following prefix does not enjoy broad community support, and as of 2025, new redirects should not be created using it:
As of 2022, creation of ""WikiProject:"" and ""Wikiproject:"" pages is blocked for most users by the title blacklist due to repeated redirect creations against consensus; administrators, template editors, and page movers can override this on a case-by-case basis if necessary. Note that some pages do exist starting with ""WikiProject "" or with ""Wikiproject "" (that is, using a space, not a colon); however, as of March 2022 all of them redirect to mainspace articles rather than to projectspace pages. (For instance, WikiProject Women in RedWikiProject Women in Red redirects to Women in Red, not to Wikipedia:WikiProject Women in Red.)
Portals have occasionally used spaces in shortcuts, e.g. ""Portal X"", or ""X portal"". Most redirects with such patterns point to articles, but, as of March 2022, 144 point outside mainspace.
Technical note: The links in the tables above go to a page where the term prefix is not used in the meaning as it has in this section.  Rather, the code PrefixIndex there means, as it does for the search parameter, ""the beginning string of characters in a title"", whether that string ends before, during or after the colon character in a page name.
When creating a shortcut, consider that many shortcuts are acronyms or initialisms; others are abbreviations or single but memorable words from a longer page title. Say you want to create the shortcut WP:TS to the existing page Wikipedia:Template standardisation. 
The template {{R from shortcut}} must always be included in this kind of redirect. It records that the redirect is a shortcut, and auto-categorizes it into Category:Redirects from shortcuts. (See Wikipedia:Template messages/Redirect pages for more information on categories of redirects.)
Before changing a shortcut, consider its existing usage:
To change the shortcut, 
After changing a shortcut, there are other pages which may need to be updated:
Redirects (including shortcuts) to pages on other projects and special pages won't work—this formerly supported feature was abused and hence it has been disabled.  The software will display the redirect page instead of redirecting the user to the target.
Some redirects to other projects and special pages use the template {{soft redirect}}; however, shortcuts that are soft redirects will appear in the pool of pages that are selected by Special:Random.  Soft redirects are categorised into Category:Wikipedia soft redirects.

Most of Wikipedia's text and many of its images are co-licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-SA) and the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts). Some text has been imported only under CC BY-SA and CC BY-SA-compatible license and cannot be reused under GFDL; such text will be identified on the page footer, in the page history, or on the discussion page of the article that utilizes the text. Every image has a description page that indicates the license under which it is released or, if it is non-free, the rationale under which it is used.
The licenses Wikipedia uses grant free access to our content in the same sense that free software is licensed freely. Wikipedia content can be copied, modified, and redistributed if and only if the copied version is made available on the same terms to others and acknowledgment of the authors of the Wikipedia article used is included (a link back to the article is generally thought to satisfy the attribution requirement; see below for more details). Copied Wikipedia content will therefore remain free under an appropriate license and can continue to be used by anyone subject to certain restrictions, most of which aim to ensure that freedom. This principle is known as copyleft in contrast to typical copyright licenses. 
To this end,
The English text of the CC BY-SA and GFDL licenses is the only legally binding restriction between authors and users of Wikipedia content. What follows is our interpretation of CC BY-SA and GFDL, as it pertains to the rights and obligations of users and contributors.
If you contribute text directly to Wikipedia, you thereby license it to the public for reuse under CC BY-SA and GFDL (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts). Non-text media may be contributed under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted re-use and re-distribution. See Guidelines for images and other media files, below.
If you want to import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, you can only do so if it is available under terms that are compatible with the CC BY-SA license. You do not need to ensure or guarantee that the imported text is available under the GNU Free Documentation License, unless you are its sole author. Furthermore, please note that you cannot import information which is available only under the GFDL. In other words, you may only import text that is (a) single-licensed under terms compatible with the CC BY-SA license or (b) dual-licensed with the GFDL and another license with terms compatible with the CC BY-SA license. If you are the sole author of the material, you must license it under both CC BY-SA and GFDL.
If the material, text or media, has been previously published and you wish to donate it to Wikipedia under appropriate license, you will need to verify copyright permission through one of our established procedures. See Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials for details. If you are not a copyright holder, you will still need to verify copyright permission; see the Using copyrighted work from others section below.
You retain copyright to materials you contribute to Wikipedia, text and media. Copyright is never transferred to Wikipedia. You can later republish and relicense them in any way you like. However, you can never retract or alter the license for copies of materials that you place here; these copies will remain so licensed until they enter the public domain when your copyright expires (currently some decades after an author's death). 
All creative works are copyrighted, by international agreement, unless either they fall into the public domain or their copyright is explicitly disclaimed. Generally, Wikipedia must have permission to use copyrighted works. There are some circumstances under which copyrighted works may be legally utilized without permission; see Wikipedia:Non-free content for specific details on when and how to utilize such material. However, it is our goal to be able to freely redistribute as much of Wikipedia's material as possible, so original images and sound files licensed under CC BY-SA and GFDL (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts) or in the public domain are greatly preferred to copyrighted media files used under fair use or otherwise. 
If you want to import media (including text) that you have found elsewhere, and it does not meet the non-free content policy and guideline, you can only do so if it is public domain or available under terms that are compatible with the CC BY-SA license. If you import media under a compatible license which requires attribution, you must, in a reasonable fashion, credit the author(s). You must also in most cases verify that the material is compatibly licensed or public domain. If the original source of publication contains a copyright disclaimer or other indication that the material is free for use, a link to it on the media description page or the article's talk page may satisfy this requirement. If you obtain special permission to use a copyrighted work from the copyright holder under compatible terms, you must make a note of that fact (along with the relevant names and dates) and verify this through one of several processes. See Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission for the procedure for asking a copyright holder to grant a usable license for their work and for the processes for verifying that license has been granted. 
Never use materials that infringe the copyrights of others. This could create legal liabilities and seriously hurt Wikipedia. If in doubt, write the content yourself, thereby creating a new copyrighted work which can be included in Wikipedia without trouble.
Note that copyright law governs the creative expression of ideas, not the ideas or information themselves. Therefore, it is legal to read an encyclopedia article or other work, reformulate the concepts in your own words, and submit it to Wikipedia, so long as you do not follow the source too closely. (See our Copyright FAQ for more on how much reformulation may be necessary as well as the distinction between summary and abridgment.) However, it would still be unethical (but not illegal) to do so without citing the original as a reference (see the plagiarism guideline).

Since most recently-created works are copyrighted, almost any Wikipedia article which cites its sources will link to copyrighted material. It is not necessary to obtain the permission of a copyright holder before linking to copyrighted material, just as an author of a book does not need permission to cite someone else's work in their bibliography. Likewise, Wikipedia is not restricted to linking only to CC BY-SA or open-source content.
However, if you know or reasonably suspect that an external Web site is carrying a work in violation of copyright, do not link to that copy of the work without the permission of the copyright holder. An example would be linking to a site hosting the lyrics of many popular songs without permission from their copyright holders. Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States (Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry [1]); cf. GS Media v Sanoma for a landmark case in the European Union. Linking to a page that illegally distributes someone else's work sheds a bad light on Wikipedia and its editors.
The copyright status of web archives in the United States is unclear. On Wikipedia it is currently acceptable to link to archives such as the Wayback Machine, which host unmodified archived copies of webpages taken at various points in time.
In articles about a website, it is acceptable to include a link to that website even if there are possible copyright violations somewhere on the site.
Context is also important; it may be acceptable to link to a reputable website's review of a particular film, even if it presents a still from the film (such uses are generally either explicitly permitted by distributors or allowed under fair use). However, linking directly to the still of the film removes the context and the site's justification for permitted use or fair use.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_the_Beholder_(2002_video_game),Eye of the Beholder (2002 video game),"Dungeons & Dragons - Eye of the Beholder is a video game released for the Game Boy Advance in 2002, developed by American studio Pronto Games and published by Infogrames. It is an adaptation of the 1991 game of the same name.
The once peaceful city of Waterdeep now suffers from raids every night by the Undermountain factions, who have somehow become reunited and organized. The raiders are led by Xanathar's Guild, who have returned to take over Waterdeep. Lacking in manpower from the City Watch, Piergeiron the Paladinson summons a group of adventurers to investigate the city sewers, uncover the evil entity, and destroy it.[2]
The games uses a stripped-down version of the 3rd edition D&D rules"" with only four basic character classes and several traits, feats and skills.[3][4] It is not a port of the original game, though it possesses roughly the same plot. It bears stronger resemblance to the original Gold Box games, such as Pool of Radiance.
Navigating through the dungeons is done in first-person mode, where the characters can make use of their skills to get through difficulties and have very limited use of spells. When an enemy is encountered, the game mode switches to an isometric view where the player engages in turn-based combat against monsters.[5] Killing all enemies ends the combat mode. In some places, the player can recruit up to two additional characters, gather information and buy or sell items. Using items requires the player to equip them in a menu-driven inventory system.[2]
The game received moderately negative reviews compared to the original computer game. It was given a 41% rating by NGC Magazine, criticizing it for its slow pace between exploration and combat, its bad interface and confusing menus, while highlighting only its variety of spells and character customization, that give the game some level of depth.[10]
According to GameSpy, this game ""only managed to be a curiosity for older gamers and an annoying Western-style RPG for a new generation of Nintendo fans who had no idea what a Gold Box game was"".[11]
The game was showcased at the 2002 Electronic Entertainment Expo[12] and presented at the DunDraCon XXVII the following year,[13] where the company president and game designer Randy Angle was interviewed.[14]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenloft,Ravenloft,"Ravenloft is a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. It is an alternate time-space existence known as a pocket dimension or demiplane, called the Demiplane of Dread, which consists of a collection of land pieces called ""domains"", brought together by a mysterious force known only as the Dark Powers. Each domain is tailored to and mystically ruled by a being called a Darklord who is forever trapped and surrounded by magical mists surrounding the domain. Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire in the original AD&D Ravenloft I6 module released in 1983, became the first Darklord, both ruler and prisoner of his own personal domain of Barovia. The story of how Count von Zarovich became Darklord of Barovia was detailed in the 1993 novel I, Strahd: The Memoirs of a Vampire. As originally established in the Ravenloft: Realm of Terror boxed set known as ""the Black Box"" released in 1990, the Ravenloft campaign setting was located in the Ethereal Plane. As a physical manifestation of that plane, lands, monsters and even people were created out of the mysterious mists, and the realm acted as a prison where one could enter or be transported, but means of escape were few. Other Ravenloft Domains and Darklords were eventually added in various AD&D 2nd edition (and then later in 3rd edition) products establishing a core continent attached around Barovia which could be traveled to by others if their respective lords allowed entering or leaving their borders; while some Domains remained isolated in the mists and were referred to as Islands.[1]
In 1978, Tracy and Laura Hickman wrote adventures that would eventually be published as the Dungeon & Dragons modules Pharaoh and Ravenloft.[2] Strahd von Zarovich was created by the Hickmans ""after Tracy returned home from a disappointing session of D&D. Back in First Edition, the game was less of a storytelling game. [...] It didn't make sense to [Tracy] why a creature like a vampire was just sitting around in a random dungeon with oozes, goblins, and zombies. So he and his wife set out to create a vampire villain with fleshed-out motivations and history"".[3] When the Hickmans began work on Ravenloft, they felt the vampire archetype had become overused, trite, and mundane, and decided to create a frightening version of the creature for the module.[4] They play-tested it with a group of players every Halloween for five years[5] on their own game system with the adventure titled Vampyr.[3] However, the Hickmans kept being asked about their ""Ravenloft game"", and so the Ravenloft name stuck. The duo eventually caught the attention of D&D's original publishers. They were hired to adapt it into the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons and it was released as Module I6: Ravenloft[3] in 1983 by TSR.[5]
The first appearance of the setting was in Ravenloft, a stand-alone Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure module, published in 1983.[6][7][8][9] In 1984, it won the Strategists' Club Award for Outstanding Play Aid.[10] It was popular enough to spawn a 1986 sequel, Ravenloft II: The House on Gryphon Hill, and an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Adventure Gamebooks novel, Master of Ravenloft, the same year.[10][11][12]
Ravenloft was launched as a full-fledged campaign setting, for AD&D 2nd Edition, in 1990,[13] with the Realm of Terror boxed set, popularly known as the ""Black Box"", and winner of the Origins Award in 1991 for ""Best Graphic Presentation of a Roleplaying Game, Adventure, or Supplement of 1990"".[14]
The campaign setting was revised twice during AD&D 2nd Edition: first as the Ravenloft Campaign Setting or ""Red Box"", then as the Domains of Dread hardback.
In 1994, Ravenloft spun off into a sub-setting called Masque of the Red Death, set on Gothic Earth, an Edgar Allan Poe-influenced alternative Earth of the 1890s, where fantasy creatures and magic exist in the shadows of civilization.[15]
TSR also published a series of novels set in Ravenloft. Each was typically focused on one of the Darklords that inhabited the Ravenloft world, with several focusing on the figure of Count Strahd von Zarovich. Many of these early novels were by authors who would later receive wider fame as horror/dark fantasy authors. These authors have included Elaine Bergstrom, P. N. Elrod, Christie Golden, and Laurell K. Hamilton.[16][17]
A major revision of Dungeons & Dragons was released in 2000, the first edition published by Wizards of the Coast (which had acquired TSR in 1997).[18] In the same year, Wizards of the Coast licensed the Ravenloft brand to White Wolf Publishing.[19] Under its Sword & Sorcery Studios (and later Arthaus imprints), White Wolf Publishing released the 3rd Edition d20 System Ravenloft Campaign Setting (2001)[20] and the 3.5 Edition Ravenloft Player's Handbook (2003).
The campaign settings published by White Wolf introduced a number of alterations, many due to conflicts with existing Wizards of the Coast intellectual property. Specific references to D&D-specific deities were replaced with new names in the White Wolf Ravenloft settings (for example, Bane was changed to the Lawgiver). The license to the Ravenloft trademark reverted to Wizards of the Coast on August 15, 2005, but White Wolf retained the right to continue to sell its back stock until June 2006. The timing of this reversion meant that the Ravenloft supplement Van Richten's Guide to the Mists did not see print. Instead, it was released by White Wolf as a free download in late September 2005.[21] The majority of the Van Richten's Guide series had already been published by TSR in the 1990s, before White Wolf's involvement.
In October 2006, Wizards of the Coast released Expedition to Castle Ravenloft, a hardcover version of the original 1st Ed. adventure, updated for the Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5 rule set.[22] This version includes maps from the original Ravenloft adventure, and new character-generation options. Expedition to Castle Ravenloft is a stand-alone supplement set for any D&D worlds, and only requires the three core books for usage. This book's setting is distinct from the Ravenloft of the White Wolf product line.[23] Shannon Appelcline, author of Designers & Dragons, highlighted that by 2006 people were beginning to wonder if Wizards of the Coast might be preparing a fourth edition of Dungeons & Dragons and stated that ""the release of Expedition to Castle Ravenloft (2006) might just have offered another clue to the changing winds that lay ahead. First, it was a new line for 3.5e, suggesting that their original series of 3.5e books was coming to an end. Second, it was a fond look back at one of the most notable adventures from the AD&D days, just the sort of thing that Wizards published in the waning days of 2e"".[24]: 294  Appelcline later noted that, once fourth edition was officially announced, ""the Expedition books that had begun publication in 2006 were revealed to indeed be part of Wizard's slow slide into 4e"".[24]: 295 
In 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced the printing of two new Ravenloft novels for 2008, Black Crusade and The Sleep of Reason,[25] fueling more speculation. A short story by Ari Marmell, ""Before I Wake"", based on the realms of Darkon, Lamordia, and Bluetspur was released on October 31, 2007, on the Wizards of the Coast website as a special for Halloween; it featured characters inspired by H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith.[26]
In 2008, Ravenloft was revealed to be re-introduced to 4th edition of Dungeons & Dragons, as was depicted in the October issue of the Dragon online magazine.[citation needed] The Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition supplement Manual of the Planes (2008) established that in the retconned cosmology, the Domains of Dread (and by extension the Ravenloft setting) were now located within the Shadowfell, a mirror-plane of death and gloom lying adjacent to the mortal realm.[27][28] While a 4th edition update to the Ravenloft setting was announced at Gen Con 2010,[29] the product was never released.[22]
In 2010, Ravenloft was the setting for the Castle Ravenloft Board Game.[30][31] Ravenloft also appeared in official magazine articles, such as, Dungeon #207 ""Fair Barovia"" (October 2012)[32] and Dragon #416 ""History Check: Strahd and Van Richten"" (October 2012).[33]
In 2016, Barovia (one of the main locations within Ravenloft) was the main setting for adventure module Curse of Strahd which acts as an adaptation of the original Ravenloft module for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons.[34][35] The adventure states: ""The lands of Barovia are from a forgotten world in the D&D multiverse [...]. In time, cursed Barovia was torn from its home world by the Dark Powers and bound in mist as one of the Domains of Dread in the Shadowfell"".[36] The module was developed in-house by the Wizards of the Coast team, led by Christopher Perkins, with story contributions by original creators Tracy and Laura Hickman.[34][36] Charlie Hall, for Polygon, explained that ""instead of reinventing the wheel, principle [sic] designer Chris Perkins brought in the module's original writers — the husband and wife team of Tracy and Laura Hickman — to create the very best version of the famous module yet. [...] Tracy and Laura have been hosting nearly annual sessions of the original Ravenloft at their home, for friends and family, over the course of decades. When Perkins asked for their input, they flew out to meet with the team. The result was a torrent of ideas for new locations, characters and encounters"".[34] Ravenloft was also the setting of the limited series comic Dungeons and Dragons: Shadows of the Vampire (2016) written by Jim Zub, and illustrated by Max Dunbar and Nelson Daniel.[37]
Wizards of the Coast released a new edition of the Curse of Strahd module, entitled Curse of Strahd: Revamped,[38] on October 20, 2020.[39] This module is the first released with the publisher's new focus on diversity and inclusion.[40] Wizards of the Coast stated that ""the adventure includes the latest errata and a revised depiction of the Vistani"" who are based on stereotypes about the Romani people.[41]
Wizards of the Coast released a new Ravenloft campaign sourcebook, Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft (2021), which introduces other Domains of Dread to the edition.[42][43] It was published on May 18, 2021.[44] The limited series comic Ravenloft: Orphan of Agony Isle (2022), by writer Casey Gilley and artist Bayleigh Underwood, then featured the mad scientist Viktra Mordenheim, the Darklord of Ravenloft's Lamordia domain introduced in Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft.[45][46] The novel Ravenloft: Heir of Strahd (2025), by Delilah S. Dawson, was the first Ravenloft novel to be published in 17 years.[47][48]
Ravenloft is primarily a Gothic horror setting. Dungeon Masters are encouraged to use scenes that build apprehension and fear, culminating in the eventual face-to-face meeting with the nameless evil.[49]  Characters have a much greater significance attached to their acts, especially if they are morally impure, as they risk coming under the influence of the Dark Powers (through the game process called ""dark powers checks"") and gradually transforming themselves into figures of evil.
The magical mists of Ravenloft could appear anywhere in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, drawing evil-doers (or player characters) into the Ravenloft setting. One exception is the phlogiston of the Spelljammer setting.[50][full citation needed][51][page needed] The phlogiston blocks all planar travel, but the Ravenloft mists can appear in deep space inside crystal shells, according to the Complete Spacefarer's Handbook.[52][page needed]
Luis Javier Flores Arvizu named the continuous presence of supernatural beings as one of the factors that made Ravenloft a very well received role-playing game setting during the 33 years of its existence.[53]
The Dark Powers are a malevolent force who control the Demiplane of Dread. Their exact nature and number are deliberately kept vague, allowing for plot development in accordance with the Gothic tradition of storytelling – where the heroes are frequently outclassed and outnumbered by unknowable evil forces beyond their control.[54]
The Dark Powers most frequently serve as a plot device for Ravenloft, especially concerning the Darklords, the de facto visible rulers of the Ravenloft Demiplane. Where the player characters are often tormented and opposed by the Darklords, the Darklords are themselves tormented and opposed by the Dark Powers. The difference lies in order of power—while many D&D adventures focus on allowing a band of heroes to prevail over a Darklord (much as in the spirit of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula), no such victory over the Dark Powers seems possible, or even conceivable, for the Darklords. Vecna and Lord Soth ""escaped"" Ravenloft, but are the only two Darklords known to have done so; Vecna by attaining the status of Greater God (and thus becoming too powerful for the Dark Powers to contain) and Lord Soth by ignoring his domain and punishment, causing the Dark Powers to lose interest in imprisoning him, and agents of his former curse on the world of Krynn coming to collect him.
Most frequently, the Dark Powers make their wishes and intentions known through subtle manipulations of fate. Thus, Barovia's vampire lord Strahd von Zarovich's many attempts to win back his love, Tatyana, are doomed to failure, but the Dark Powers arrange such that he never truly loses hope. Each time, for example, Strahd's own actions may be partially culpable for his failure, and as such he may go through crippling self-recrimination, rather than cursing the gods solely and giving up. Most other Darklords have similar tales of frustration, kept all the more unbearable because the flicker of the possibility of success is never truly extinguished.
Not all Darklords acknowledge the Dark Powers directly, however. Strahd, for example, in his own memoirs, speaks only of a force known as Death, who mocks him with the voices of his family and former colleagues throughout his life. Vlad Drakov, the Darklord of Falkovnia whose military expeditions are doomed to constant failure, seems even to be totally oblivious to any non-mortal factors in his repeated defeats.
The Dark Powers also seem capable of non-evil manipulations. Although their machinations are often directly responsible for the misery of many of Ravenloft's inhabitants, they also appear to play a role as dispensers of justice. Some tales of innocents who have escaped Ravenloft for happier environs are attributed to the Dark Powers, who have judged a being worthy of reward and release from their misty domain.
There are many Domains of Dread that makeup the landscape of Ravenloft. The Domains are surrounded by strange mists that can ensnare both people and places in Prime Material Plane and pull them into the Domains. Each Domain is ruled by a Darklord, but each Darklord was imprisoned in their Domain by the Dark Powers.[55][56] The Dark Powers ""are believed to have been responsible for the overall creation of the Dread Domains"".[55] The concept of Domains and locations in Ravenloft besides Barovia and Mordent was introduced in the 2nd Edition campaign setting book Ravenloft: Realm of Terror (1990).[1] This book outlined that the size of Ravenloft is ""40,000 square miles [spanning] 26 different domains, including Barovia and Mordent. All of the core domains are overviewed in Ravenloft, as are eight 'islands'"".[1] The revised 2nd Edition boxset Ravenloft Campaign Setting (1994) is an update to Realm of Terror, but it removes Domains that were destroyed in the Grand Conjunction adventure series and adds new Domains.[57] The metaplot of the adventure series was used to update the setting: ""David Wise, leader of the 'Kargat' of Ravenloft designers at TSR, has said there were a few reasons for the changes. Some domains were changed or removed because they didn't fit into Ravenloft ecologically [...]. Some domains were removed or merged because their lords were too similar, and finally some islands of terror were kicked to the curb just because they were 'less exciting'. [...] A few domains that had appeared since the publication of Ravenloft: Realm of Terror were notably missing [...].  All told, Ravenloft Campaign Setting covers 20 core domains and nine islands"".[57] The 5th Edition campaign guide Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft (2021) includes an overview of 39 Domains and many Domains are given a ""wholesale revision"" while ""other Domains keep their original lore but are advanced in other ways"".[56] Rob Wieland, writing for Forbes, explained that in this book ""many of the domains have new Darklords that reflect their original character but have details changed to better fit the type of horror the domain is supposed to represent"".[58]
Some of the more notable Domains include:
Darklord is the title used to refer to the mystically imprisoned and cursed ruler of a domain. A Darklord was originally an individual who had committed a truly horrific crime, which drew the attention of the enigmatic Dark Powers. The Dark Powers then proceeded to craft a personal kingdom around the Darklord. This crafted domain serves both as a kingdom and a prison:[55] the Darklord gains incredible powers whilst within its borders but can never leave it, although most Darklords can seal their domain borders with a thought.[65] Within their domains, the Darklords are forever tormented by the objects of their desires, which are often the objects for which they committed their crimes.
The Vistani are a nomadic ethnic group. They are based on depictions of the Romani people. Since their introduction in the original Ravenloft module (1983) as fortune-tellers, they became a unifying element in the Ravenloft and the Masque of the Red Death campaign settings, which offer Gothic horror scenarios. In a Ravenloft adventure, the Vistani have some control of the Mists of Ravenloft, which divide realms,[66] while the players are generally confined to a region from which they must escape by solving one or more problems. Players generally need help from the Vistani to travel reliably from one open realm to another.
The Vistani people were ""described as superstitious""[67] and had ""abilities to curse and hypnotize players or cast spells like Evil Eye"".[68] They were also originally stereotyped ""as 'uncivilized' and heavy drinkers"", but this portrayal was removed in the adventure module Curse of Strahd Revamped (2020).[68] Their portrayal was further retconned in Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft (2021); the Vistani people are no longer considered superstitious but instead focused on their traditional practices and their abilities are grounded in the forms of magic found in Dungeons & Dragons.[69]
The fictional character Rudolph van Richten, a famous Monster Hunter in Ravenloft and author of a series of guides to hunting and slaying various monsters, had a great enmity for the Vistani for most of his monster-hunting career, but his opinion improved during his penning of Van Richten's Guide To The Vistani, during which he befriended a mortu (a Vistani outcast).
Game designer Rick Swan commented in 1994 that when the Ravenloft setting first came out, it ""just didn't seem special, a Forgotten Realms variant with a few more bats"", but after supplements like Forbidden Lore, The Created, and the Van Richten's Guide series, Swan felt that ""the Ravenloft campaign has proven to be a credible adventure alternative for players interested in the dark side of the AD&D game. Though it lacks the flamboyance of Call of Cthulhu and the, er, bite of Vampire, the Ravenloft setting remains the hobby's most enduring fusion of horror and fantasy"".[70]
Darker Days Radio declared Ravenloft the ""greatest D&D campaign setting"", citing the unique gothic horror elements and classic villains such as Azalin Rex.[71]
In the Io9 series revisiting older Dungeons & Dragons novels, Rob Bricken highlighted that Vampire of the Mists ""isn't scary, per se, but Strahd wreaks enough horror and carnage to drive home that Ravenloft is much, much more sinister than the Forgotten Realms. [...] Ravenloft (and I guess Forgotten Realms) vampires have all the tropes: They can turn into bats, wolves, and mists, and they don't cast reflections. They can control animals and enthrall people, to a degree. They can't cross running water, and they have to be invited into a home to enter. Unless they're an extremely powerful vampire like Strahd, natch"".[72]
Shelly Jones, in the journal Analog Game Studies: Volume IV, highlighted the Tarokka Deck mechanic used in both the original Ravenloft (1983) module and the 5th edition Curse of Strahd (2016) module to add randomization to the game and increase replayability. Jones wrote: ""The Tarokka Deck incorporates an inconsistency in the game play that reflects fragmented traumatic memory and reifies the inconsistency present within an abusive relationship"".[73] Jones also highlighted that ""without sunshine as a key time-tracking element, players are forced to rely upon other means to signal the passage of time within Barovia. Further adding to that disorientation is the knowledge that the players have been abandoned from anything familiar or real. [...] This alienating effect, based upon the physical environment as well as the psychological manifestations, traumatizes characters"".[73]
The Ravenloft setting has been criticized[67][68][74] ""for reinforcing harmful stereotypes through its portrayal of the Vistani, an in-fiction analogue for the Roma people"".[75] In 2020, Wizards of the Coast announced ""in the editorial process for Strahd's reprint, as well as two upcoming products, Wizards worked with a Romani consultant to present the Vistani without using reductive tropes"".[76] On this update, Jon Ryan, for IGN, wrote that ""it's worth noting that the book's illustrations of the Vistani still evoke Romani culture, and some players may still associate certain abilities [...] with outdated cultural stereotypes"".[77] Julie Muncy, for Io9, criticized the ""granular changes"" to the Vistani people as not very extensive and that ""while there's a real opportunity here to do better work—the aforementioned diversity pledge also mentioned future works that will feature the Vistani people and aim to complicate their depictions—starting that work with a fancy collector's edition feels less like a promise to do better and more like a victory lap"".[68] Muncy also highlighted that the unrevised parts, such as the art and specific magical abilities, still lean ""into tropes that suggest the Romani have mystical, dangerous powers, tropes that have been used in the past to target Romani for persecution"".[68]
Christian Hoffer, for ComicBook.com, highlighted that in Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft (2021) the Domains of Dread ""all now function as originally intended: prisons meant to torture specific souls. Many of the original Ravenloft domains featured strange punishments that didn't necessarily fit the crime of the Darklord. The revised domains are usually a better utilization of the ironic intent that flavors the immortal prisons of Ravenloft. The domains also now include a variety of different horror genres rather than a fixation on gothic horror. Finally, much of the misogynistic, colonialist, or racist elements have been purged out of this new iteration of Ravenloft. Although these changes will likely be the most talked about part of the book in some circles, these changes seem to have occurred naturally during the course of updating Ravenloft to reflect more diverse horror genres and to make the domains conform to Ravenloft's internal laws"".[56]
In his 2023 book Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, ""In many ways, Strahd is a vessel for the audience's relationship with an ever-changing and evolving vampire legend. While a character in his own right, he is broadly drawn, so every group of players can make him their own. There are many Strahds, each defined by the tastes of the people at the table.""[78]
Ravenloft has acted as the official campaign setting for multiple Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying adventure modules, sourcebooks and accessories. It has also been the main setting for novels and video games.[79]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Dungeons_%26_Dragons:_Slayer,Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Slayer,"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Slayer is a fantasy first-person, dungeon crawl / action role-playing game based on the second edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. The game was developed by Lion Entertainment and published by Strategic Simulations in 1994 for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. A Japanese version titled Lost Dungeon (ロストダンジョン) was published by T&E Soft the following year.
Slayer features a customizable dungeon generator so each time the player starts the game, they are faced with a new dungeon. The dungeon always ends with a boss floor, randomly selected from several possible bosses. When starting a new game, the player may either create a custom character with randomly generated stats, pick from a selection of preset characters, or reuse a previously created character. The game may be saved at any time, but is limited to a single save slot.
Slayer was developed as part of a contract between video game corporation SSI and TSR, the owner and publisher of the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. SSI had previously used the license to adapt the property into a number of notable games including Pool of Radiance, the Gold Box series, and Eye of the Beholder.[3] For Slayer, SSI gave development duties to Lion Entertainment, an Austin, Texas-based studio founded by Douglas Grounds in June 1993.[4] Grounds was also a producer at The 3DO Company's Austin office.[5] Lion Entertainment's principle staff for  Slayer consisted of director Ronald Bollinger; programmer Glen Merriman; music composer Billy Wolfe; sound editor Geoffrey Sanders; art director Daniel Bourbonnais; and artists Daniel Bourbonnais, Martin Thomas, Sara Farr, and Rebecca Price. Grounds served as executive producer while assisting on programming. The game's 3D modeling and rendering were done by Grounds, Bollinger, and Sanders.[6]
Slayer was released exclusively for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer by SSI in North America in September 1994[1] and by SSI's parent company Mindscape in Europe in 1995. The game was published by T&E Soft in Japan on January 20, 1995 under the title Lost Dungeon.[2] Computer Gaming World reported months ahead of the game's scheduled launch that SSI and TSR were dissolving their partnership and that Slayer would be one of the last products in that agreement.[3] A version for the PlayStation was announced for an October 1995 release but never materialized.[7][8] SSI and Lion Entertainment did collaborate on a sequel to Slayer titled Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: DeathKeep, released on 3DO in 1995 and Windows in 1996.[9][10] Lion Entertainment went on to port several popular first-person shooters including Doom II, Duke Nukem 3D, and Quake to Macintosh before voluntarily closing in 1999.[4][11][12]
GamePro gave the game a generally positive review, saying it successfully combines fast-paced action in a Wolfenstein 3D vein with traditional RPG gameplay. They criticized the music and lack of sound effects, but praised the abundance of options and the varied dungeon layouts, and commented that the adjustable difficulty make the game appropriate for players of all ages.[15]
Next Generation was generally negative to the game and gave it 2 stars out of 5.[21]
Allen Rausch for GameSpy called Slayer ""a fantastic game"" for how rare it is, and that it ""was actually one of the better games"" for the 3DO system.[29]
Concordia University professor and author Mark J. P. Wolf noted Slayer as an example of a game that utilizes handcrafted assets (including walls, doors, and windows) to give each of its dungeons a deliberate feel in their design despite a reliance on random, procedural generation for their layouts.[30]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Tales_of_the_Sword_Coast,Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast,"
Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast is an expansion pack of the fantasy role-playing video game Baldur's Gate. Developed by BioWare and published by Interplay, it adds 20 to 30 extra hours of gameplay, including the addition of four areas and minor tweaks to some of the mechanics. The expansion consists of four notable quests that take place within the same game world as Baldur's Gate, and sees players taking their character (referred to as the Ward) and their party of companions across the Sword Coast, from travelling to a distant island, to exploring the fortress dungeon of a dead dwarf. Tales of the Sword Coast sold 600,000 units by 2003.
The expansion retains the same fundamental gameplay mechanics of Baldur's Gate. The new areas incorporated into the same world map as the original game, a number of tweaks and improvements were made.[citation needed] These include:
In addition, if the player had completed the original game, the expansion features the option of loading a save game of their player character and their party, placing them within the new settlement of Ulgoth's Beard, where most of the quests begin.[citation needed]
Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast takes place around the same time of the original game, and within the same region of Faerûn. The expansion adds a number of locations, including the small town Ulgoth's Beard, a mysterious island in the Trackless Sea, the Isle of Ice, and the ruins of Durlag's Tower.[2] While it provides additional side quests, these do not impact the original game's main story, especially if it is ongoing.
A party of adventurers consisting of Gorion's Ward and their companions travel to Ulgoth's Beard, a small town with great adventuring possibilities. They meet with a mage called Shandalar who asks them to recover a cloak of his from the Isle of Ice, forcefully teleporting them to the island. The Ward's party fight against those who were trapped in the island's dungeon, recovering the cloak and managing to return with it.
Heading to the town's docks, the party encounters Mendas, a man who seeks help for an expedition to track down the ship used by Balduran. After returning with a sea chart that had been found by a local guild in Baldur's Gate, the party travel across the Trackless Sea. A storm to shipwrecks them on an island, where they discover a village. The Ward's party learn from the village's chief that they suffer from werewolf attacks, to which the party agree to help deal with them, learning that the creatures reside in the wreck of Balduran's ship. Venturing towards it, the group encounter an elven mage in a cave, who reveals the truth behind the incident aboard Balduran's ship, and that the villagers are not what they seem to be. Defeating what turns out to be wolfweres, the party returns to the village to find that all the villagers were actually werewolves, forcing them to fight through them, including a Loup Garou, in order to escape the island. Returning to Ulgoth's Beard, the group learns that Mendas is a werewolf and had sent them out to help him bring back the village chief, his mate, along with the villagers, in order for them to roam free across the Sword Coast. Upon learning of what the Ward did, Mendas transforms into a Loup Garou and attacks the party, but is defeated.
In the town's inn, the party encounter Hurgan Stoneblade, a dwarf, who asks them to help him recover the Soultaker Dagger from the dungeons beneath Durlag's Tower. The party travel to the ruined tower for a guided tour, just as a powerful Demon Knight claims control over the ruins and its dungeon, forcing the party to fight past several creatures while overcoming the traps and puzzles set up by Durlag, defeating the Demon Knight and recovering the Soultaker. Upon returning to Ulgath's Beard, the group are accosted by a member of a cult, who steals the Soultaker from them. Forced to take it back, the party venture into the cult's hideout, but arrive too late to stop them from summoning demon from the Abyss called Aec' Letec. Fighting it, the party defeat the cult and kill the demon, preventing it from escaping into the rest of the Sword Coast, while ending their final adventure in the town.
Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast began development in 1998. Mark Asher of CNET Gamecenter reported that it was already ""several months"" into production by January 1999.[3] The game was officially announced in early February.[4]
Tales of the Sword Coast went gold on April 26, 1999,[5] and shipped to retailers on May 4.[6]
Tales of the Sword Coast debuted at #1 on PC Data's computer game sales chart during the May 2–8 period,[7] and held the position the following week,[8] but fell to #6 in its third week.[9] The game remained in the top 10 for the entirety of May,[10][11] and was the second-best-seller of the month overall, behind Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace.[12] By the week ending June 12, the game had fallen off the weekly charts,[13] but it finished in 17th place on PC Data's monthly chart for June.[14] In the United States alone, sales of Tales of the Sword Coast reached 156,000 copies by March 2000.[15]
By late 2003, global sales of Tales of the Sword Coast had surpassed 600,000 copies.[16]
The expansion was critically well received. In the review from GameSpot, the game was found to feature ""some occasionally frustrating battles, adds only minor gameplay enhancements, and takes a few additional liberties with AD&D rules"", but the new areas and game content were found to be well-designed and interesting.[23] Computer Games Strategy Plus called it ""a solid add-on to an excellent title"", but complained that glitches occasionally caused the game to crash.[18] According to GameSpy, ""especially for new players, the 'add-in' structure would make an already rich experience richer, improving one's Baldur's Gate experience immeasurably"".[24]
Tales of the Sword Coast won the Origins Awards for ""Best Roleplaying Computer Game of 1999"".[25] It was a runner-up for Computer Games Strategy Plus's 1999 ""Add-on of the Year"" and GameSpot's ""Best Expansion Pack"" awards, but lost these prizes to Heroes of Might and Magic III: Armageddon's Blade and Half-Life: Opposing Force, respectively.[22][21]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Engine,Infinity Engine,"The Infinity Engine is a game engine which allows the creation of isometric role-playing video games adapting the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset. It was originally developed by BioWare for a prototype real-time strategy game codenamed Battleground: Infinity, which was ultimately re-engineered to become 1998's Baldur's Gate. BioWare used it again in subsequent installments of the series and also licensed the engine to Interplay's Black Isle Studios to create the Icewind Dale series and Planescape: Torment. The engine would serve as the cancelled Battleground: Infinity's namesake.[1]
The Infinity Engine was conceived by BioWare as the foundation for a real-time strategy game, then-titled Battleground: Infinity, which eventually evolved into the first Baldur's Gate, a computer role-playing game.[2]
The graphical engine was specifically optimized for computer role-playing games. It relies on unified huge pre-rendered 2D scrolling backgrounds, with both characters and objects represented by sprites. OpenGL acceleration for enhanced effects was added with Baldur's Gate II.[2][3]
In December 2002, following the release of BG2, Ray Muzyka announced a high-resolution patch for BioWare's games that enabled the Infinity Engine to support resolutions higher than 800×600 pixels.[4] The last original game to use the Infinity Engine was Icewind Dale II, released in 2002, unique for adapting the newer D&D 3e instead of 2e.[5]
The Aurora Engine is regarded as the spiritual successor to the Infinity Engine. BioWare would use it to create Neverwinter Nights (2002) and its expansions.[6][7] The Polish studio CD Projekt Red also employed the Aurora Engine to develop The Witcher, the 2007 video game adaptation of the Polish novel series by Andrzej Sapkowski, although the rendering module was rewritten from scratch.[8]
Players independently wrote GemRB, a game engine recreation of Infinity that is open source and multiplatform. After development started in 2000, it first achieved completability of a game (BG2) in 2009, and of all games by 2024.[9]
From 2012 to 2017, Infinity was modernized for remasters by Beamdog of all games (except IWD2, due to the loss of its source code),[10] as well as for a new expansion to BG1, Siege of Dragonspear.[11]
The following games and expansions are powered by the Infinity Engine:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonlance,Dragonlance,"
Dragonlance is a shared universe created by the American fantasy writers Laura and Tracy Hickman, and expanded by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis under the direction of TSR, Inc. into a series of fantasy novels. The Hickmans conceived Dragonlance while driving in their car on the way to TSR for a job interview. Tracy Hickman met his future writing partner Margaret Weis at TSR, and they gathered a group of associates to play the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. The adventures during that game inspired a series of gaming modules, a series of novels, licensed products such as board games, and lead miniature figures.
In 1984, TSR published the first Dragonlance game module, Dragons of Despair, and the first novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight. The novel began the Chronicles trilogy, a core element of the Dragonlance world. While the authoring team of Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis wrote the setting's central books, numerous other authors contributed novels, short stories and game supplements to the setting. Over 190 novels have used the Dragonlance setting; the Dragonlance campaign setting has also been used for multiple editions of Dungeons & Dragons and for the SAGA System. Following Wizards of the Coast's acquisition of TSR in 1997, Wizards licensed Dragonlance to Margaret Weis's company Sovereign Press to produce game materials; this licensing agreement ran from 2001 to 2007. Dragonlance returned in 2022 with a new adventure module and the start of a new novel trilogy.
The fictional Dragonlance world of Krynn contains numerous characters, an extensive timeline, and a detailed geography. The history of Krynn consists of five ages. The novels and related game products are primarily set in the fourth age, The Age of Despair. Since the publication of Dragonlance: Fifth Age in 1996, the fifth age, the Age of Mortals, has been used.[1] The Heroes of the Lance, created by Weis and Hickman, are the popular protagonists of the Chronicles trilogy. Along with D&D's world of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance is one of the most popular shared worlds in fiction.
Hickman developed his world creation technique by writing and self-publishing with his wife Laura the adventure modules Rahasia (1979) and Pharaoh (1980), and writing TSR's Ravenloft module (1983). He was unemployed in 1982, and TSR offered him a job based on his submission of several modules.[2] That year, while driving from Utah to Wisconsin to start a job with TSR, Hickman and his wife created the Dragonlance universe concept. During the trip, Hickman and his wife discussed two ideas they had had for several years: an entire world used to support a storyline, and a world dominated by dragons.[3]
Their ideas were well received by TSR, whose marketing department felt they had enough dungeons, but not enough dragons. Hickman suggested a series of twelve modules, each featuring a different dragon. TSR employee Harold Johnson suggested that Hickman should try to get additional support from other TSR staff members and, after a period of months, Hickman had the support of Jeff Grubb, Larry Elmore, Roger Moore, Doug Niles, Michael Williams, and others with whom they discussed ideas for the project. Meanwhile, Weis was editing and writing various Endless Quest books for TSR. The Dragonlance group decided that novels should accompany the game modules; TSR reluctantly agreed and hired a writer.[3] Hickman became the design coordinator for Project Overlord, the cover name for what would later be known as the Dragonlance saga.[4]
TSR decided to create a franchise, including modules, board games, lead figures, and - for the first time - novels. Weis had been hired as an editor; with Hickman, she began working with the author hired to write the novels. They weren't satisfied with the author, and decided they should be the ones to write the books.[2] They collaborated over a weekend, writing the prologue for the first five chapters of the first novel,[2] Dragons of Autumn Twilight, based on the module Dragons of Despair.[5] TSR liked their treatment and gave them the assignment, firing the author. After two years of development, TSR released the module Dragons of Despair and the novel Dragons of Autumn Twilight in March and November 1984, respectively.[6][7] TSR had doubts about the finished novel's sales potential, and attempted to order thirty thousand copies, ultimately ordering the minimum print run of fifty thousand. The success of the novel prompted TSR to publish more copies to meet demand.[2] The novel was written after the completion of the first Dragonlance game modules. Weis and Hickman felt this was constraining and made the novel feel too episodic, so they reversed the process for the next books and completed the novels before the related modules were written.[8] Dragonlance received support products such as novels, calendars, computer games, and books of artwork.[9]
In the mid to late 1980s, a rift developed between TSR and the authors. Weis and Hickman were feeling under-appreciated and, when TSR turned down their Darksword series of novels, they went to Bantam Books. Bantam made them an offer, which they accepted, and they stopped writing Dragonlance novels for TSR.[2] They returned to write Dragons of Summer Flame for TSR in 1995, thinking it would be their final Dragonlance novel. At the time, Dragonlance gaming had been converted to the SAGA System, with limited success, and that, combined with TSR's general financial troubles, put the setting's future in doubt. Wizards of the Coast bought the troubled TSR in 1997, and Weis and Hickman then proposed the War of Souls trilogy, which was published in 2000-2002. All three novels made the New York Times bestseller list, and the setting was commercially revitalized.[3] By 1998, the original Dragonlance trilogy had sold well over three million copies worldwide and spawned dozens of sequels.[10] The central books of the Dragonlance series were written by the authoring team of Weis and Hickman, but many other writers have made contributions, including Richard A. Knaak, Douglas Niles, Roger E. Moore, Don Perrin, Jean Rabe, Paul B. Thompson, Tonya C. Cook, Michael Williams, Nancy Varian Berberick, and Chris Pierson.
In 2001, Wizards of the Coast licensed Sovereign Press to publish further Dragonlance game materials. This began with the newly revised Dragonlance Campaign Setting in 2003, which used the new Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition rules.[3] In April 2007, Wizards of the Coast had not renewed Sovereign's license, and Dragonlance RPG game supplements and accessories were only released through the end of the year.[11]
In October 2020, Weis and Hickman filed suit against Wizards of the Coast for breaching a licensing deal with Weis and Hickman for a new Dragonlance novel trilogy.[12][13] Boing Boing reported that ""according to the lawsuit, Weis and Hickman agreed with Wizards of the Coast to produce the new novels in 2017, capping off the series and giving fans a final sendoff, but the company pulled the plug in August 2020"".[14] In December, Weis and Hickman filed to voluntarily dismiss without prejudice their lawsuit,[15] and ""the filing noted that Wizards of the Coast had not formally answered their lawsuit, nor had they filed for a summary judgement"".[16] Weis and Hickman's publishing agent affirmed a few weeks following this that a new trilogy of Dragonlance novels was in the works;[17] the first of the new trilogy was released in August 2022.[18][19]
In December 2022, the first Dragonlance adventure module, titled Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen, for 5th Edition was released. The module is set during the War of the Lance; Wizards of the Coast has stated that the module does not require prior knowledge of the setting or the novels to play the module.[20][21] An integrated board game, titled Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn, was released in 2023, designed by Stephen Baker and Rob Daviau.[21][22] Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn is a wargame that focuses on military battles during the War of the Lance. Both games can be played independently, but the adventure module includes rules for using the board game to resolve the military battles that occur in the narrative.[22]
TSR created Dragonlance as a campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) roleplaying game in 1982, publishing the first of a series of modules, Dragons of Despair, in March 1984. They published the first world-spanning sourcebook, Dragonlance Adventures, in 1987. When AD&D was updated to the 2nd edition in 1989, the Dragonlance campaign setting was updated as well. However, in 1996, Dragonlance was converted to use the new SAGA System, which uses cards to determine the effects of actions, with the publication of the Dragonlance: Fifth Age roleplaying game.[7]
When the 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons was released in 2000, Dragonlance was not initially updated for the new edition. In 2002, Margaret Weis's company Sovereign Press acquired the license to publish 3rd Edition Dragonlance material. The official update, Dragonlance Campaign Setting, was published in 2003 for the 3.5 Edition. Wizards of the Coast turned over all responsibility for maintaining the Dragonlance setting to Sovereign Press until 2007.[23][3][11] The campaign setting was not supported during the 4th Edition era (2008-2013) of Dungeons & Dragons.[24]
In March 2022, Wizards released the PDF Heroes of Krynn which is part of the ""Unearthed Arcana"" public playtest series for the 5th Edition of Dungeons & Dragons.[25] Polygon commented that this ""all but confirmed"" the return of the Dragonlance setting.[26] The setting was revisited in December 2022 with a new adventure module for the 5th Edition.[20] On December 6, Wizards released the adventure book Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen.[27]
The main storyline of the original Dragonlance series has been predominantly written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman.
Eight video games are set in the Dragonlance world. They belong to six different genres and were released within five years, from 1988 to 1992.
DL01 - Dragons of Despair and DL02 - Dragons of Flame (corresponding to the events in the first novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight) were adapted into the video games Heroes of the Lance and Dragons of Flame, respectively. Instead of being role-playing video games, they are platform games using the Silver Box game engine. DL03 - Dragons of Hope and DL04 - Dragons of Desolation (corresponding to the events between the first and the second novel) were adapted into the video game Shadow Sorcerer. Released in 1991, this early real-time strategy game is a direct sequel to the first two games and a prequel to War of the Lance (1989). DL11 - Dragons of Glory is a self-contained tabletop strategy game (corresponding to the events in the background of the third novel, Dragons of Spring Dawning) that was adapted into the turn-based strategy game War of the Lance.
DragonStrike is a 1990 combat flight simulation game whose plot begins halfway through the previous video game. The 1992 NES remake is a scrolling shooter that features an ending different from the one in the novels, but following and fixing a ""bad ending"" from DL14 - Dragons of Triumph. Neither game is based directly on any tabletop module. The Gold Box trilogy (Champions of Krynn, Death Knights of Krynn, and The Dark Queen of Krynn) are the only role-playing video games based on Dragonlance. They tell an original story that begins shortly after the events in the 14 tabletop modules.
Apart from those, the MUSH game DragonLance is based on Krynn during the final stage of the War of the Lance.[28]
The series has inspired mention in music as well, including ""Wishmaster"", a song by Nightwish based partially on the master and apprentice relationship between Raistlin Majere and Dalamar. The Swedish metal band Lake of Tears also recorded a song called ""Raistlin and the Rose"" on their 1997 album Crimson Cosmos, while the German group Blind Guardian wrote ""The Soulforged"", another song inspired by Raistlin's story, which appeared on the band's 2002 album A Night at the Opera.[29] Also Danish/American band Pyramaze recorded in their 2008 album Immortal song ""Caramon's Poem"".[30] A Russian concept album (2009-2010) and musical (premiered 2014) based on Raitslin's story, The Last Trial, was created by Anton Kruglov and Yelena Khanpira.[31]
In 2008, Dragonlance: Dragons of Autumn Twilight, an animated film based on the first Dragonlance book of the same name, was released direct-to-video. The animation was produced by Toonz Animation, and featured the voices of Lucy Lawless, Kiefer Sutherland, Michael Rosenbaum, and Michelle Trachtenberg.[32] In late 2011, Holysoft Studios Ltd. released the first part of a German audio adaption of the Chronicles Trilogy, with subsequent releases of the later trilogies being announced.[33]
In comics, Krynn has been represented on the 1988 Dragonlance series by DC Comics and TSR.[34] More recently, Devil's Due Publishing and Wizards of the Coast have also produced a number of comic book series: The Legend of Huma (2003),[35] Chronicles (2005) and Legends (2008).[36]
The Dragonlance world is described in dozens of books and novels. The setting contains numerous characters, an extensive timeline, and a detailed geography.
Dragonlance is set on the world of Krynn. Most of the novels take place in the regions of Ansalon, a small continent, though some have taken place on the continent of Taladas, located northeast of Ansalon. The world's major gods are the High God and his children: good Paladine, neutral Gilean, and evil Takhisis. The gods are opposed by Chaos, who seeks to destroy Krynn. Depending on the period, the evil chromatic and the good metallic dragons are rare or plentiful. Humans are Krynn's most common humanoid race, but elves, dwarves, kender, gnomes, and minotaurs occupy the world as well. Clerics derive magical powers from their gods, and wizards derive power from the three moon gods, good Solinari, neutral Lunitari, and evil Nuitari. Hickman had previously served as a Mormon missionary in Java for two years and used Indonesian in Dragonlance spells.[2] During Krynn's various wars, armies of draconians are used as troops. Draconians are created by corrupting a dragon egg, creating a reptilian humanoid. Any dragon egg can be used to make a draconian, although the ones most commonly used are good dragon eggs because the evil kings want more evil dragons to hatch.
Other gods of the setting include the gods of good Branchala, Habbakuk, Kiri-Jolith, Majere, and Mishakal; the gods of neutrality Chislev, Reorx, Shinare, Sirrion, and Zivilyn; and the gods of evil, Chemosh, Hiddukel, Morgion, Sargonnas, and Zeboim.
The history of the world of Krynn, and thus the settings for both the novels and gaming supplements, is roughly split into five separate ages. The first age is the time of creation, when the gods are born and Krynn is formed. The Age of Dreams, the second age, is marked by the rapid growth of the world's first great civilizations and the appearance of myriad new races. This era is also marked by three great wars between dragons and their minions. Following the Third Dragon War, in the Age of Might, the Cataclysm obliterates the great empire of Istar and changes almost the entire surface of Krynn. A 300-year depression follows this event, in what is called the Age of Despair. This period also marks the War of the Lance. When Dragonlance was first introduced to Dungeons & Dragons, events such as the Lost Wars happened during The Age of Despair.[37] Later Age of Mortals novels and game supplements took Krynn into  the Fifth Age (the Age of Mortals).[1][38]
Dragonlances are rare and not commonly traded. There are lesser dragonlances, which are made when only one of the artifacts is used to create them, and greater dragonlances, which are made when both artifacts are used to make them. Greater dragonlances are blessed with the power of Good, unlike lesser dragonlances.[39]
There are two sizes of dragonlance. The smaller footman's dragonlance is around eight feet long and functions as a polearm, while the larger mounted dragonlance is around sixteen feet long and most commonly used when mounted on a dragon.[40][41]
The Heroes of the Lance are the protagonists of the Chronicles trilogy, the first series of Dragonlance books. They were created by Weis and Hickman, then fleshed out as player characters in gaming sessions of Dungeons & Dragons at Hickman's apartment. One player at this initial gaming session was game designer Terry Phillips, who was playing as Raistlin. According to Hickman in the foreword to The Soulforge, ""[we] were just settling in to the game when I turned to my good friend Terry Phillips and asked what his character was doing. Terry spoke...and the world of Krynn was forever changed. His rasping voice, his sarcasm and bitterness all masking an arrogance and power that never needed to be stated suddenly were real. Everyone in the room was both transfixed and terrified. To this day Margaret [Weis] swears that Terry wore the black robes to the party that night.""[43]
In a ""Traveling Road Show"" put on to publicize the novels, the Heroes of the Lance were played by various people. Authors Gary and Janet Pack played the half-elf Tanis Half-Elven and the kender Tasslehoff Burrfoot, respectively. Author Douglas Niles played the dwarf Flint Fireforge. TSR employee Harold Johnson played the Solamnic knight Sturm Brightblade. The rest of the Heroes are the barbarians Goldmoon and Riverwind, elf Laurana Kanan, and humans Caramon Majere (Raistlin's brother) and Tika Waylan. Weis played Fizban the Fabulous.[3]
In the beginning, Margaret Weis had problems depicting Tanis Half-Elven in the novels. Tracy Hickman finally told her that ""he's James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise"". After that explanation, Margaret had no more difficulty writing about Tanis.[44] Other noteworthy antagonists, and sometimes protagonists, are the Death Knight Lord Soth and Kitiara Uth Matar, the half-sister of Raistlin and Caramon, and leader of one of the Dragonarmies of Ansalon. According to Hickman, Lord Soth is the most unpredictable character to write about: ""Every time that character made an appearance in one of our books he would try to run off with the story"".[45]
The world of Dragonlance is set on the planet of Krynn, with most of the action taking place on the continent of Ansalon. Some of the key countries and areas on Ansalon are the Plains of Dust, Solamnia with its great metropolis, Palanthas,[46] the Blood Sea Isles, the Empire of Ergoth, Istar, and Sancrist, the elven kingdom of Silvanesti,[47] as well as the dwarven realm of Thorbardin. Important cities and towns and other locations include Solace (location of the Inn of the Last Home, and Sad Town), the High Clerist's Tower, Palanthas, Kendermore, Port Balifor (location of the Pig and Whistle Tavern), and the various Towers of High Sorcery.
Like in many Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings, the fictional world of the Dragonlance campaign is shaped by the division by race, with white humans as the central focus, but also including elves, goblins, and many others.[48][49] With the species in many cases clearly assigned to ""good"" and ""evil"",[50] some critics have suggested that the setting had the potential to raise racist expectations.[49] The authors take an active stance against racist ideology and ensure that a ""fascistic genocidal campaign to wipe-out species that are considered 'impure'"" would have catastrophic consequences.[49] In contrast, the authors emphasize the need for tolerance and cooperation between the races.[49]
Dragonlance is one of the most popular shared worlds, worlds in which writers other than those that created them place adventures.[51] The first Dragonlance trilogy, Chronicles, launched the Dungeons & Dragons line of novels, with many of its characters spun off into other novels.[52] Along with Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance is TSR's most popular series of novels. According to The 1990s by Marc Oxoby, what is most notable about the series is that ""what may at one time been considered disposable, escapist literature"" found ""unprecedented popularity"" in the 1990s.[53] All of the Dragonlance novels remained in print during the decade, turning Weis and Hickman into literary stars and boosting sales of their non-Dragonlance novels. Although the series was initially published in paperback, its success led to hardcover printings. The hardcover version of Dragons of Summer Flame had an ""impressive"" first printing of 200,000 books.[53] Every Dragonlance novel by Weis and Hickman since 1995 has been released in hardcover, and some previous novels have been re-released in hardcover collector's editions.[54] Dragonlance made TSR one of the most successful publishers of science fiction and fantasy in the 1990s.[55]
By 2008, there were more than 190 novels in the Dragonlance franchise.[5] Weis and Hickman's Dragonlance novels have made over twenty bestseller lists, with sales in excess of 22 million.[55] The pair's novels have been translated into German, Japanese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Spanish, French, Italian, Hebrew, Portuguese, Greek and Turkish and have sold well in the United States, Britain, and Australia.[2]
Not all critics have praised Dragonlance and its creators. According to author Stephen Hunt, Wendy Bradley of Interzone magazine does not think highly of their work. Hunt feels that it is unusual for authors to receive such loathing among ""fantasy's literary mafia"", saying that ""behind every critic's scorn laden insult, there lays [sic] that unsaid thought at the end: 'But I could have written that!'""[2] Visions of Wonder, edited by David G. Hartwell and Milton T. Wolf, and published by the Science Fiction Research Association, argues that Dragonlance is published under the ""omnivore theory"" of publishing. In this theory, the readership is made up of teenagers, and completely replaces itself every three to five years. This allows publishers to release subpar novels and still reach a small yet profitable audience.[56]

Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II is a 2004 hack and slash action role-playing game for PlayStation 2 and Xbox developed by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay Entertainment, with distribution handled by Vivendi Universal Games in North America and Avalon Interactive/Acclaim Entertainment[5] in Europe. It is the sequel to the 2001 game Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance.
The game is set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting of Dungeons & Dragons, and the gameplay is based on the rules of Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition, which were released in 2000.[6] Dark Alliance II is a direct sequel to the original Dark Alliance game, with the story following five adventurers attempting to save Baldur's Gate from a growing evil, and ascertain the fate of the protagonists from the first game.
Dark Alliance II was well received on both platforms, although many critics felt it was not much of an advancement on the first game. A sequel was planned, but was cancelled early in development due to legal problems and the closure of Black Isle Studios after Interplay went bankrupt.[7] The use of the Dark Alliance game engine led to a lawsuit filed by the engine's creators, Snowblind Studios, against publisher Interplay, which alleged the engine had been used in the game without Snowblind's permission.
The game was later ported and released on Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S in July of 2022.
Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II is a real-time hack and slash action role-playing game presented in a 3D perspective, with a rotatable isometric three-quarter top-down view.[8]
At the beginning of the game, character stats are preset, with the player able to choose from five race/class combinations; a human barbarian (Dorn Redbear), a drow monk (Vhaidra Uoswiir), a moon-elf necromancer (Ysuran Auondril), a dwarven rogue (Borador Goldhand) or a human cleric (Allessia Faithhammer).[9] The player can customize their character's stats through gaining experience points from defeating enemies. Every time the character increases in level, points are awarded corresponding to that level; i.e. if a character increases to level twelve, the player will gain twelve experience points to spend on the character's spells and feats.[10] For every four levels which the character increases, the player is given one ability point to spend on one of the six core attributes (strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, charisma).[11]
Each of the five characters have their own unique fighting style and their own specific set of spells and feats. Gameplay strategy is thus different for each character. Dorn is a Barbarian, and his feats tend to focus on increasing his brute strength and ability to resist damage, as well as granting him powerful abilities to aid in melee combat, such as the ability to wield two-handed weapons in each hand. Vhaidra relies on unarmed combat, so her feats tend to focus on increasing her speed and combos, as well as granting her close-range abilities, such as pushing enemies away from her. As Ysuran is a necromancer, his feats tend to focus on increasing the power of his magic and granting him new spells, such as the ability to use shadow magic. Borador tends more towards archery, but is also capable of melee combat. His spells tend to focus on allowing him to use a shield offensively, and granting him the ability to set traps for enemies and disarm traps intended for the player. Allessia is a cleric and has access to many healing and defensive spells. She can also use melee combat. Later in the game she gains the ability to reanimate the dead, and have them fight alongside her.[12]
Gameplay is semi-linear; most of the main quests can be performed in different orders, but only from within a group of given quests. For example, in Act I, the player can choose to tackle a series of kidnappings or investigate a spate of murders, but no other main quests are made available until both quests are complete. There are also optional side-quests, which do not have to be completed. There are more NPCs than in the first game, and the player can interact with many of them. Depending on which character the player is using, these NPCs may or may not provide information and assistance. Weapons, armor and items are only available for purchase from one location throughout the game, a shop in Baldur's Gate, although the stock changes at the commencement of each act, with the weapons increasing in expense and power. The HUD features the option to use either a transparent map that covers most of the screen, or a mini-map, with the player also given the option to turn the map off entirely.
The game also features cooperative gameplay with another player. Both players share the same screen, and are thus limited in how far they can move away from one another. In co-op mode, both players get 50% of the experience for each kill, no matter which player makes the kill. Additionally, unlike in the original game, all treasure is shared 50/50 between both players, irrespective of which player collects it.[13]
A new feature in Dark Alliance II gives players the ability to create custom weapons and armor. Players can improve items by using runestones and gems.[14] To increase the strength of an item, at least one runestone must be used. Gems are optional, although adding gems increases the strength further and enhances certain of the items' attributes. The player cannot place more gems on an item than runestones; if the player wishes to place four gems, they must have a minimum of four runestones attached. Each item can have two different types of gem attached at any one time, in addition to the required runestones. There are several different kinds of gem and each has a different effect on different types of item. For example, a pearl attached to a piece of armor gives +1 additional treasure drop, attached to a weapon gives +1 ""Improved Critical"", and attached to a trinket gives +1 Wisdom.[15]
The game contains four difficulty levels: ""Easy"", ""Normal"", ""Hard"" and ""Extreme"". Extreme is unlocked once the player has completed any of the other three levels. Extreme mode takes the form of a New Game Plus, and can only be played by importing a saved character from another game. The game also contains two secret characters: Drizzt Do'Urden and Artemis Entreri. Drizzt becomes available to use in the main game upon beating any difficulty level. Artemis is unlocked upon defeating Extreme.[16]
While the original game focused on three areas in the Sword Coast and Western Heartlands regions of the Faerûnian continent, the second game is predominately based in and around the city of Baldur's Gate itself.
The game features five main playable characters; Dorn Redbear, Ysuran Aundril, Borador Goldhand, Vhaidra Uoswiir and Allessia Faithhammer, each of whom has come to Baldur's Gate for different reasons. Dorn seeks fame and glory. Vhaidra has come looking for vengeance against those who have attempted to destroy her family. Ysuran is suffering from amnesia and has come in the hope of finding clues to his past. Borador comes for wealth, in order to release his clan from its debt to the drow. Allessia comes to spread the word of Helm and advance to become a high-ranking priest.[9]
The game begins by revealing that after jumping through the portal at the top of the Onyx Tower, Vahn, Kromlech and Adrianna are taken prisoner by the vampire Mordoc SeLanmere.
Meanwhile, outside Baldur's Gate, Dorn, Vhaidra, Ysuran, Borador and Allessia meet on the Trade Way, and learn that since the collapse of Xantam's Guild, the route has become increasingly dangerous due to the rise of the Red Fang Marauders, a goblin army who prey on travelers. After infiltrating a nearby Marauders cave, and freeing the caravan guard Randalla, the heroes head to Wayfork Village, a nearby fiefdom. There, they rescue the village from the Marauders and kill their hobgoblin leader, Harnak.
Upon entering Baldur's Gate, Randalla hires them to investigate a series of murders in the city. At Bloodmire Manor, they learn that Luvia Bloodmire has been combining the body parts of various creatures in an attempt to make a new species, and has been giving her creations to Lady Aragozia Firewind. Her first creation, Argesh, has set up the Hands of Glory, a thieves' guild faction of the Marauders. The heroes kill Argesh, crippling the Hands of Glory, and infiltrate the main base of the Marauders. There, they defeat but do not kill the Red Queen, leader of the Marauders. They follow her to Lady Arogazia's manor, and learn that Arogazia is a member of the Zhentarim, a criminal network intent on ruling Faerûn. She has been using the Marauders in an effort to bring back the Onyx Tower. Along with her associate Kharne (a former member of Xantham's Guild, presumed killed in the first game), Arogazia escapes from the heroes, revealing herself as the polymorphed form of the red Dragon, Aizagora.
Impressed with their efforts, Jherek, a member of the Harpers, requests that the heroes find four elemental objects. Meanwhile, the Zhentarim are also trying to attain the objects to reactivate the Onyx Tower. During their journey, the heroes encounter Sleyvas, the humanoid lizard who betrayed the protagonists at the end of Dark Alliance. He too is working for the Zhentarim, and the heroes kill him. After finding the four objects, each of the heroes pursues their own personal quest.
After killing the dragon Baragoth, the druid inside Dorn is awakened. Ysuran realizes his horrific past and his hate crimes against humans, determining not to worry about the past, but instead build a good name for himself in the future. Borador frees Gandam's Hold and reclaims the Goblinbreaker name for his clan, who begin working on new forges to free themselves from their debt to fey folk. Vhaidra travels to Cloud Peaks and gets her revenge on a murderous black elf who assisted in the fall of her family's house. Allessia frees the Church of Helm in Baldur's Gate from Goreth Vileback, a cleric of Cyric.
After the five return to town, Jherek enlists them for a journey to each of the Elemental Planes to activate the Elemental Foundations using the four objects they recovered. In each plane, they are attacked by the Zhentarim, who are in control of the Foundations. Luvia Bloodmire and Aizagora attack them, but are defeated. Upon returning from the final plane and speaking to Jherek, they are approached by Kharne. He tells them the Zhentarim no longer wish to reactivate the Onyx Tower, and that the Harpers and the Zhentarim have a common enemy: Mordoc SeLanmere. Mordoc believes he can use the Tower to bring about the downfall of Baldur's Gate, which will please his ""allies in the east"". His steward, Xanhast, interrogates Vahn, Adrianna and Kromlech, finding they know little of the larger scheme playing out. Kharne, Jherek and the five adventurers storm Mordoc's Keep of Pale Night. They rescue the trio of adventurers, forcing Mordoc to speed up his plans, and relocate the Onyx Tower into Baldur's Gate ahead of schedule.
Now called Mordoc's Gate, the entire population of the city are turned into zombies. The five adventurers attack the Tower, kill Xanhast, and attack Mordoc in the Elemental Plane of Shadows. After killing him, they destroy the Onyx Heart, supposedly destroying the Tower forever. This releases the citizens from their zombification, and led by Randalla, they thank the heroes for saving the city. Meanwhile, in a room with an Ancient Egyptian milieu, a servant tells a stone sarcophagus that Mordoc has failed and Baldur's Gate still stands. The sarcophagus says that Mordoc's failure will not interrupt his ""sacred"" mission, and orders his servant to prepare the army and ready his sun barge.
Dark Alliance II was first mentioned in April 2001, when Interplay Entertainment confirmed that if the first game was successful, a sequel would enter development immediately.[17] The game was officially announced in March 2003 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The only information available at that time was that the game would introduce item crafting, have five playable characters and was slated for a simultaneous PlayStation/Xbox release in the winter of 2003.[6] In May, IGN published an interview with Kevin Osburn, head of the development team at Black Isle Studios and the game's producer. Osburn revealed that the developers had taken on-board criticisms of the first game, and addressed those problems in the sequel, as well as making everything bigger, with more enemies, characters, weapons, locations and quests.[18]
At E3 in May 2003, Interplay showcased the Xbox version of the game, revealing three of the new characters: a human barbarian, a moon-elf necromancer and a drow monk. Interplay considered porting the game to GameCube if the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions sold well.[19] In July, demos for both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions were released. All five characters were available for play, and their character-specific sidequests were finalized. Weapon creation was also showcased, as was co-op mode. Both IGN and GameSpot were impressed with the demo, although both expressed some concern that the graphics was essentially the same as in the first game.[20][21] At the 2003 Gen Con in July, the game was revealed to be 90% complete and was on schedule for an October release.[22]
In September, Interplay canceled its distribution deal with Vivendi Universal Games, due to alleged breaches of the working agreement and failure of payment. According to Herve Caen, CEO of Interplay:
In the interest of our company and its shareholders, we had no choice but to terminate this agreement. After several notifications to Vivendi of its failure to perform in accordance with the terms of our agreement and, in particular, in refusing to pay Interplay certain monies due following our latest release, Lionheart, we still did not receive the payments owed to us. We are currently evaluating several other distribution options. We fully expect to release two of our strongest titles, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II and Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel for Xbox and PlayStation 2 in the fourth quarter.[23]In October, EB Games and GameStop websites changed the release dates for the game to January 2004. Interplay initially denied the delay, stating it was still aiming for a fourth quarter release, and would distribute the game itself if necessary.[24] Interplay also stated that despite the fallout, Vivendi Universal would still distribute the title and any future installments in the series in Europe.[25] By November, Interplay had resolved its legal dispute with Vivendi, and returned to their prior distribution agreement.[26] The game was also confirmed to be delayed until early 2004.[27]
In December, reports surfaced that Interplay had shut down Black Isle Studios, although Interplay itself made no formal statement.[28][29] According to IGN, Black Isle Studios was closed that month, and that existed only as a brand under the Interplay label. They reported that when Black Isle's director had quit, the studio was placed under the management of Digital Mayhem, but with the agreement that Interplay would adopt a more hands-off approach. By this stage, Black Isle had already begun work on Dark Alliance III. The title was cancelled after Interplay failed to retain the license to use the Dungeons & Dragons label from Wizards of the Coast, so Black Isle shifted focus to Fallout 3. They handed in a 95% complete demo, including all game functionality. Interplay however, who was several million dollars in debt, with just over $1 million in the bank, began to fire people from Digital Mayhem. Two weeks later, all but two members of the Fallout team were fired. This effectively meant Black Isle Studios no longer existed as anything other than a brand. Apparently, staff were told by Interplay that they will continue to produce titles under that brand.[30] Interplay however denied the rumors about shutting the studio, saying that Black Isle Studios was involved with other projects, which included Fallout 3 (under the working title Van Buren) and Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel.[31] An anonymous former Black Isle employee later confirmed to IGN that the studio had been closed, and that although Dark Alliance II would still be released, Fallout 3 and Dark Alliance III had been officially cancelled.[32]
Dark Alliance II was released for both PlayStation 2 and Xbox on January 20, 2004, with Vivendi Universal Games handling North American distribution of the title.[33] Initially, Vivendi Universal planned on distributing the game in Europe as well,[25] but at the end of that month, Avalon Interactive, Interplay's European distributor, entered into an agreement with Acclaim Entertainment to distribute the title in the UK, France, Germany, and Benelux territories.[34]
A remastered version of the game was released for Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on July 20, 2022.[35][36][37]
In November 2003, Snowblind Studios, developers of the original Dark Alliance and creators of the Dark Alliance engine, filed a lawsuit against Interplay. Snowblind alleged that Interplay had used the game engine in several games without their permission and withheld royalties due from the sale of those games. These games were the GameCube version of the first Dark Alliance game, which was developed by High Voltage Software, Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, and Dark Alliance II. The lawsuit was settled in April 2005, and determined that while Interplay could continue to publish materials already using the Dark Alliance engine, they could not use the engine in any future projects. The lawsuit also saw Interplay transfer the Baldur's Gate trademark to Atari and temporarily transfer the Dark Alliance trademark to Snowblind.[38]
A soundtrack for Dark Alliance II has not been released. In September 2013, composer Craig Stuart Garfinkle released an album called Songs of the Dragon, V2 featuring primarily music from the game.[39]
Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II received ""generally favorable reviews"", with the PlayStation 2 version holding an aggregate score of 78 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on forty-four reviews,[48] and the Xbox version 77 out of 100, based on forty-four reviews.[49]
Game Informer's Andrew Reiner scored the PlayStation 2 version 8.5 out of 10, calling it a ""role-playing bliss"", praising the range of characters, missions and weaponry, the item customization, the non-linear structure and the range of environments. Comparing the game to the original, he said that DAII has ""a much deeper play"" with a higher level of interaction.[41]
IGN's Ed Lewis scored the game 8.4 out of 10, opining that Black Isle Studios made an appropriate continuation of the story, but was critical of the similarity of the gameplay to the first game and felt that there should have been more variety in the game's missions, more weapons and characters, and that the gameplay could have been less linear.[8][45]
GameSpot's Ryan Davis scored the game 8 out of 10, and praised the range of missions and the ability to craft new weaponry, but was critical of the graphics, which he felt hadn't really advanced from the first game. He called Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II ""a well-crafted, accessible action RPG experience"".[42][43] GameSpot later named Dark Alliance II the best Xbox game of January 2004.[50]
Eurogamer's Ronan Jennings scored the Xbox version 7 out of 10. While generally positive to the gameplay and graphics, he felt that ""DAII feels more like an expansion pack"" rather than as a full-fledged sequel and that the game does not have the same ""magic"" as the original game had.[40]
GameSpy's Raymond Padulla scored the PlayStation 2 version 3 out of 5. He praised the differentiation in the fighting style of the playable characters, but felt that it was inferior to the original game in some other aspects. He was also critical of the graphics, saying that some parts of the game are ""dated"". He called Dark Alliance II a good game, but said that the game did not progress too much compared to the original game.[44] Writing later in 2004, Allen Raucsh said that Black Isle Studios ""took over the development chores"" for this game, but that ultimately delivered the same game without some significant innovations.[51]
In 2015, Ian Williams of Paste rated the game #7 on his list of ""The 10 Greatest Dungeons and Dragons Videogames"". He called its gameplay to be more akin to Diablo than Baldur's Gate, in which the characters cannot be created from scratch, but that the game offers a wide variety of playstyles for playable characters, the game's customization while leveling up, and a co-op mode, compared to other DnD games for PC platform.[52]
The remastered version of the game received ""mixed or average"" reviews, according to Metacritic.[53][54]
Mitch Vogel of Nintendo Life gave the game five stars out of ten, praising its gear crafting system and dark atmosphere while lamenting its sluggish combat, drab environmental design, lack of online, low build variety, and high price tag, and felt that the game was ""left in the dust"" by more modern releases.[55]
Shaun Musgrave of TouchArcade compared the title unfavorably to modern offerings on the Switch such as Diablo III and the Torchlight franchise, citing the no-frills nature of the port and its high price tag as blemishes on a dated experience.[56]
"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweet_(social_media),Tweet (social media),"
A tweet (officially known as a post since 2023) is a short status update on the social networking site Twitter (officially known as X since 2023) which can include images, videos, GIFs, straw polls, hashtags, mentions, and hyperlinks. Around 80% of all tweets are made by 10% of users, averaging 138 tweets per month, with the median user making only two tweets per month.
Following the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk in October 2022, and rebranding of the site as ""X"" in July 2023, all references to the word ""tweet"" were removed from the service, changed to ""post"", and ""retweet"" changed to ""repost"".[1] The terms ""tweet"" and ""retweet"" are still more popular when referring to posts on X.[2][3]
The service has experimented with changing how tweets work over the years to attract more users and to keep them on the site. The character limit was originally 140 characters when the service started, had media attachments no longer count in the mid-2010s, and doubled altogether in 2017. Now, a tweet can contain up to 280 characters and include media. Users subscribed to X Premium (formerly Twitter Blue) can post up to 25,000 characters and can include bold and italic styling.
Tweets originally were limited to 140 characters when the service launched, in 2006. Twitter was originally designed to be used on SMS text messages, which are limited to 160 characters. Twitter reserved 20 characters for the username, leaving 140 characters for the post.[4] The original limit was seen as an iconic fixture of the platform,[5][6][7] encouraging ""speed and brevity"".[8]
Increasing the limit had been a topic of discussion inside the company for years, and had been resurfaced in 2015 for ways to grow the userbase. At the time, internal discussion also involved excluding links and mentions from the character limit.[9] By January 2016, an internal product named ""Beyond 140"" was in development, targeting Q1 of the same year for expanding tweet limits.[10] By the end of 2015, the company was moving close to introducing a 5,000 or 10,000 character limit.[11] An unfinalized version had tweets that went over the old 140 character threshold only showing the first 140 characters, with a call-to-action that there was more in the tweet. Clicking on the tweet would reveal the rest, which was done to retain the same feel of the timeline.[10][11]
The change was controversial internally[12] and met with backlash by users.[13] Dorsey confirmed that the 140 character limit would remain, but had told employees upon his return as CEO that the once-sacred aspects of Twitter were no longer untouchable.[13]
In May 2016, a week after being leaked,[14] Twitter announced that media attachments (images, GIFs, videos, polls, quote tweets) nor mentions in replies would no longer increase the character limit to be rolled out later in the year to ready developers.[15][16] The changes rolled out in September,[17][18][19] except for the @replies, which were tested in October[20][21] and then rolled out in March 2017, a year after the original announcement.[22][23][24] These changes were a compromise to internal resistance to a 10,000 character limit from the year before.[12]
On September 26, 2017, Twitter announced the company was testing doubling the character limit—from 140 to 280. It was an effort for users to be more expressive with their tweets,[25][12] as users were otherwise cramming ideas into a single tweet by rewriting and removing vowels,[26] or not tweeting at all.[27] It began testing to a small group of users in all languages, excluding Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, because the three languages can say double the amount of information in one character. According to the company's statistics, 0.4% of tweets in Japanese hit the 140 character ceiling, while 9% of tweets in English hit the ceiling.[8] Users not in the test group were able to see and interact with them normally.[5]
The change was similarly controversial internally as the 10,000 character limit proposal.[27] The immediate reaction by Twitter users was largely negative.[28]
URLs can be linked on Twitter. A tweet's links are converted to the t.co link shortener, and use up 23 characters out of the limit.[14] The shortener was introduced in June 2011 to allow users to save space on their links, without needing a third-party service like Bitly or TinyURL.
Some users use screenshots of text and uploaded them as images to increase the amount of words they could include in a tweet.[29]
Beginning in 2012, tweets linking to partnered websites would show, below the content of the tweet, expanded media: an excerpt of a linked news article or an embedded video. Twitter already had a way to see Instagram posts and YouTube videos, called ""expanded tweets"".[30][31][32][33] Twitter then began allowing websites apply to test offering cards for Twitter users.[34] Later in 2012, notably after Facebook purchased it, Instagram started cropping images displayed in cards, with the plan to end them all together.[35][36][37][38]
Between July 2022 and January 2023, Twitter tested a feature where two users could be the author of a tweet, which would be posted on both of their accounts. Both users' profile pictures, names, and handles are shown.[39][40] One user drafts a tweet in the Composer field, then invite a user that is both following them and has their account published.[39] Edits could not be made once the invite was sent, with the alternative being deleting the invitation and making a second one.[41] The second author could accept the invitation, at which the tweet would then be posted to both accounts.[39] Once published, the second user could revoke them being a co-author, and the tweet would change to being written by the first author and being removed from the second author's tweets.[42] Until the second author accepts the invitation, the tweet would be unlisted, not appearing on the authors' timelines or in searches, but available via a direct link.[43]
It was tested with some accounts in the US, Canada, and South Korea.[44] The company noted during the test that the feature may be turned off and all CoTweets deleted.[39] The feature was spotted in code in December 2021.[42]
On January 31, Twitter suddenly and quietly decided to stop new CoTweets from being made,[45] though noted that it could return in the future.[46] CoTweets were able to be seen for another month, before being converted to a normal tweet for the first author, and a retweet for the second author.[47] Though Twitter's support page offered a generic reasoning for discontinuing the feature, Elon Musk said that it was to focus on allowing users to add text attachments.[48][45]
Twitter briefly tested a feature in 2022 that allowed users to set the current status—codenamed ""vibe""— for a tweet or account, from a small set of emoji-phrase combinations. It would allow the user to either tag per-tweet, or on the profile level with it showing on tweets and the profile.[49][50][51] Testing began on vibes in June 2022 with a wider selection that could be put above tweets, but disappeared after some time. Phrases included ""✔️ Current status"" and ""💤 Case of the Mondays"".[52] Twitter removed the ability to add vibes to tweets.[when?]
Users can interact with tweets by 'retweeting' (reblogging), liking, quoting the tweet, or replying to it.
In November 2009, Twitter began rolling out the ability to 'retweet' a tweet. Prior to this, people would write ""RT @username"" before quoting the original tweet. Some people limited their 140 character limit down further, so that other people could always fit their entire tweet in a proto-retweet.[4] In 2023, with the rebranding of Twitter to X, ""retweets"" were quietly renamed to ""reposts""; however, ""retweets"" remained the most commonly used term on the site.
Tweets can be liked by users, adding them to a list that other users used to be able to view, prior to likes becoming private for all users.[53] The feature was available when Twitter launched in 2006.[54] Until 2015, 'likes' were called 'favorites' (or 'favs'). The service renamed them because people ""often misunderstood"" the feature, and people reacted more positively in user tests.[55][56] Users had the option of hiding their likes from the public,[57] though their like would not be hidden from the list of users who likes a given tweet.[58][59] Jack Dorsey said in 2019 that, if he had to create Twitter over again, he would deemphasize the like, or not include it altogether because it did not positively contribute to healthy conversations.[54]
Likes used to be public and they are not broadcast to the user's tweets timeline.[59] When likes were public, users would often forget their likes were public[60][59] or liked more revealing tweets.[61] High-profile users and politicians' accounts have liked pornographic, hateful,[62] and racist tweets.[63][64] For instance, in 2017, Ted Cruz's account liked a tweet with a two-minute porn video about a day after it was posted. Cruz said that many people had access to his account and one of his staff members pressed the like button in ""an honest mistake"".[65]
Likes would later be privatized for all users profiles, with Elon Musk stating ""Public likes are incentivizing the wrong behavior"", and encouraging users to like more Tweets without fear of being noticed. Likes are now anonymous, except to the author of the tweet, and to the person who liked it.[57][66] Verified users could choose to private their likes prior to the update.
When not logged in, users' tweets are sorted by how many likes they received, opposed to reverse-chronological.[67][68]
In 2014, Twitter began testing a new feature that allows users to embed a tweet inside their tweet to add additional commentary. Prior to this, users could include a snippet of another tweet in a new tweet, but were limited to quoting the—at the time—140 character limit. It was originally called ""retweet with comment"", and was later named ""quote tweet"".[69][70] Following the rebranding of Twitter to X, quote tweets were renamed, simply dropping the ""tweet"" to become ""quotes"". The common name still largely remains ""quote tweets"".
Multiple tweets in reply to each other are grouped together in 'threads'. The 140 character limit prevented users from posting as complete thoughts as they desired, and resorted to making upwards of dozens of tweets, which all showed in a disjointed manner, dubbed a ""tweetstorm"".[71][29] It was popularized by Marc Andreessen.[4][72]
Users are able to add a bookmark to individual tweets via the bookmark button, or within share icon menu, saving them to revisit them later. The bookmarks are private,[73][74] but tweets display the number of times it has been bookmarked, if at all.
The development was revealed to in October 2017. The feature, highly requested by Japanese users, started from an annual hack week at the company[75] and called ""#ShareForLater"".[76] Previously, users would resort to liking the tweet or by sending it to themselves.[77][78] Liking tweets is often seen as an endorsement or positive endorsement, and the likes are public and are notified to the user who made the tweet.[76][74] The feature was tested in November for some users,[79][80] and rolled out in February 2018 on mobile alongside a new share menu.[81][82] The web version of Twitter did not test the bookmark feature until November 2018[83] When released, the user who made the tweet would have been unaware that a tweet was bookmarked.[84]
In March 2020, Twitter added a label to a manipulated video of then-candidate Joe Biden that Donald Trump retweeted.[85] Two months later, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter introduced a policy that would label or warn users on tweets with COVID-19 misinformation.[85] The company said at the time that other areas would have labels covered, and shortly afterwards, misleading information on elections were included.[86]
On March 26, then-US president Donald Trump made two false statements about mail-in ballots, claiming they were ""substantially fraudulent"".[85] Within 24 hours of the tweet,[85] Twitter's general counsel and the acting head of policy jointly decided to label Trump's tweets, with several hours of internal debate from company leaders, and then-CEO Jack Dorsey signed off on the decision shortly before the label was applied.[86] The labels, which told readers to ""Get the facts about mail-in ballots"", was the first time they were applied to Trump's tweets. A spokesperson for Twitter said that the tweets contained ""potentially misleading information about voting processes and have been labeled to provide additional context around mail-in ballots"". The label linked to articles by CNN, The Washington Post, and The Hill, as well as summaries of claims of fraud.[85]
Three days later, a tweet about the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis–Saint Paul was hidden from view.[87]
In the weeks after the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Twitter rolled out a new program that allowed users to add notes underneath tweets that would benefit from additional context.
Prior to the transfer of Twitter to Elon Musk, Community Notes were officially called Birdwatch.[88]
just setting up my twttrMarch 21, 2006[89]
The first tweet, made by Jack Dorsey, was made on March 21, 2006. It has the Snowflake ID of 20.
The Iconfactory was developing a Twitter application in 2006 called ""Twitterrific"" and developer Craig Hockenberry began a search for a shorter way to refer to ""Post a Twitter Update."" In 2007 they began using ""twit"" before Twitter developer Blaine Cook suggested that ""tweet"" be used instead.[90]
""Tweet"" was added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary in 2011[91] and to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2012.[92][93] Both its use as a verb and noun were added. This was notable as the Oxford English Dictionary normally waits ten years after the coining of a word to add it to the dictionary.[94]
In 2023, the terms ""tweet"" and ""retweet"" were quietly retired in favor of the terms ""post"" and ""repost"", as a part of Twitter's rebrand to X, but many users continue to use the former terms on the platform.[95]
The median Twitter user tweets twice a month. Around 80% of tweets made are from 10% of the users, who tweet 138 times per month. 65% of the prolific users are women, compared to 48% of the bottom 90%. Most of the prolific users tweet about political issues. There is no difference in political views between the two groups. 25% of the prolific users use automated tools to make tweets, compared to 15% of the others.[96]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic,Metacritic,"
Metacritic is an American website that aggregates reviews of films, television shows, music albums, video games, and formerly books. For each product, the scores from each review are averaged (a weighted average). Metacritic was created by Jason Dietz, Marc Doyle, and Julie Doyle Roberts in 1999, and was acquired by Fandom, Inc. in 2022.
Metacritic turns each critic and user review into a respective percentage score. This can be done either by calculating the score from the rating given or by making a subjective decision based on the review's quality. Before averaging the scores, they are adjusted based on the critic's popularity, reputation, and the number of reviews they have written. The site also includes a summary from each review and links to the original source, using colors like green, yellow, or red to indicate the overall sentiment of the critics.
Metacritic won two Webby Awards for excellence as an aggregation website. It is regarded as the foremost online review aggregation site for the video game industry.[2][3] Criticism of the site has focused on the assessment system, the assignment of scores to reviews that do not include ratings, third-party attempts to influence the scores, and the reported lack of staff oversight for user reviews.
Metacritic was launched in January 2001 by Marc Doyle, his sister Julie Doyle Roberts, and his University of Southern California law classmate Jason Dietz, after two years of developing the site.[4] Rotten Tomatoes was already compiling movie reviews, but Doyle, Roberts, and Dietz saw an opportunity to cover a broader range of media.
Metacritic was sold to CNET in 2005.[5] CNET and Metacritic were later acquired by the CBS Corporation.[6] In 2020, Metacritic and other CNET titles were bought by Red Ventures.[7] In 2022, Red Ventures sold Metacritic and other entertainment websites to Fandom, Inc.[1][8]
Metacritic has been used by businesses to predict future sales. In 2007, Nick Wingfield of The Wall Street Journal wrote that Metacritic ""influence[s] the sales of games and the stocks of video game publishers"". He explains its influence as coming from the higher cost of buying video games than music or movie tickets. Many executives say that low scores ""can hurt the long-term sales potential"". Wingfield wrote that Wall Street pays attention to Metacritic and GameRankings because the sites typically post scores before sales data are publicly available, citing the respective rapid rise and fall in company values after BioShock and Spider-Man 3 were released.[5] In an interview with The Guardian, Marc Doyle cited two major publishers that ""conducted comprehensive statistical surveys through which they've been able to draw a correlation between high metascores and stronger sales"" in certain genres. He claimed that an increasing number of businesses and financial analysts use Metacritic as ""an early indicator of a game's potential sales and, by extension, the publisher's stock price"".[9] However, a 2015 study analyzing over 88 Xbox 360 and 80 PS3 games from 2012 found that Metacritic scores did not impact actual sales.[10]
Controversially, the website has been used by game publishers as a means of determining whether a game's developer receives additional royalties. One notable example is the 2010 game Fallout: New Vegas, which received an average Metascore of 84, one short of the 85 points required by Bethesda Softworks, the game's publisher. As a result, its developer, Obsidian Entertainment, received no additional bonus. Outlets took issue with the company's use of Metacritic, with one suggesting that this makes game critics ultimately accountable for deciding the developer's profits and another pointing out that a Metascore of 84 is not significantly lower than 85. The latter also pointed out the impressive sales of five million sold units and US$300 million in revenue, and also noted a series of Obsidian's layoffs in 2011 and 2012.[11][12]
The website has also been used by outlets and commentators as a general reference for critical reception,[13] and by publishers as a tool of improving their products. Along with other executives, in 2008, John Riccitiello, then CEO of Electronic Arts, showed Wall Street analysts a chart illustrating a downward trend in the average critical ratings of the company's games. He took the ratings seriously and stressed the need for the company to bounce back.[14] Also in 2008, Microsoft used Metacritic averages to delist underperforming Xbox Live Arcade games.[15][16]
Scores are weighted averages. Certain publications are given more significance ""because of their stature"".[5] Metacritic has said that it will not reveal the relative weight assigned to each reviewer.[17]
Games Editor Marc Doyle was interviewed in 2008 by Keith Stuart of The Guardian to ""get a look behind the metascoring process"". Stuart wrote: ""The Metascore phenomenon, namely Metacritic and GameRankings, have become an enormously important element of online games journalism over the past few years"".[9] Doyle said that because video games lead to a greater investment of time and money, gamers are more informed about reviews than are fans of film or music; they want to know ""whether that hotly anticipated title is going to deliver"".[9]
In June 2018, Metacritic established the ""Must-See"" label for a movie that ""achieves a Metascore of 81 or higher and has been reviewed by a minimum of 15 professional critics"".[19] In September 2018, it added the ""Must-Play"" certification for video games attaining a score of 90% or more, and a minimum number of 15 reviews from industry professionals.[20][21]
Metacritic's efficacy has been analyzed by critics, outlets, and commentators, finding it to be generally useful[22] or unreliable and biased.[23] The website won two annual Webby Awards for excellence in the ""Guides/Ratings/Reviews"" category, in 2010 and 2015.[24][25]
Metacritic has been criticized for converting all scoring systems into a single quantitative percentage-based scale. For example, an ""A"" score equates to the value of 100, an ""F"" the value of zero, and a ""B−"" the value of 67.[9] Joe Dodson, former editor at GameRevolution, criticized Metacritic and similar sites for turning reviews into scores that he found to be too low.[5] Doyle defended the grading system, believing that every scale should be converted directly to that of the website, with its lowest possible score being 0 and the highest 100.[9] Further criticism was directed to the website's refusal to publicize how it aggregates scores.[10]
According to Doyle, publishers often try to persuade him to exclude reviews they feel are unfair, but he said that once a publication is included, he refuses to omit any of its reviews.[5] A Washington Post review of Uncharted 4 was assigned with a rating of 40/100 by Metacritic; this was the only negative review of the game.[26] Readers who disapproved of the review petitioned Metacritic to remove the Post as a trusted source.[27] Similarly, Metacritic does not publish updated review scores, stating that they found ""many publications had been pressured to raise review scores (or de-publish reviews) to satisfy outside influences.""[28][29] Video game designer Raphaël Colantonio criticized this policy on the basis that a game's technical issues that affected reviews could be patched and review scores updated accordingly by publications, while its Metacritic score would not change; he felt this was misleading and encouraged developers to make ""safe boring games"".[28][29]
As a result of its perceived negative influence on the industry, several reviewing sites, including Kotaku and Eurogamer, have dropped numerical reviews that would appear in Metacritic, instead favoring a qualitative assessment of a game.[30][31] Kotaku also highlighted the aforementioned practice used by some publishers who use Metacritic scores as a way to leverage more favorable terms for the publisher, or deny developers bonuses should they not reach a certain score. Doyle countered this by saying ""Metacritic has absolutely nothing to do with how the industry uses our numbers. Metacritic has always been about educating the gamer. We're using product reviews as a tool to help them make the most of their time and money.""[32]
Critics and developers have pointed out that a product can suffer from rating manipulation by users through review bombing, sometimes by throwaway accounts.[33][34][35][36] Signal Studios president and creative director Douglas Albright described the website as having no standards, following a review bombing of one of their games.[36] In July 2020, Metacritic added a 36-hour waiting period for user reviews to be posted for video games at launch in an effort to reduce review-bombing.[37]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management,Customer relationship management,"
Customer relationship management (CRM) is a strategic process that organizations use to manage, analyze, and improve their interactions with customers. By using data-driven insights, CRM helps businesses optimize communication, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sustainable growth.[1]
CRM systems compile data from a range of different communication channels, including a company's website, telephone (which many services come with a softphone), email, live chat, marketing materials and more recently, social media.[2] They allow businesses to learn more about their target audiences and how to better cater to their needs, thus retaining customers and driving sales growth.[3] CRM may be used with past, present or potential customers. The concepts, procedures, and rules that a corporation follows when communicating with its consumers are referred to as CRM. This complete connection covers direct contact with customers, such as sales and service-related operations, forecasting, and the analysis of consumer patterns and behaviours, from the perspective of the company.[4]
The global customer relationship management market size is projected to grow from $101.41 billion in 2024 to $262.74 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 12.6% [5]
The concept of customer relationship management started in the early 1970s, when customer satisfaction was evaluated using annual surveys or by front-line asking.[6] At that time, businesses had to rely on standalone mainframe systems to automate sales, but the extent of technology allowed them to categorize customers in spreadsheets and lists. One of the best-known precursors of modern-day CRM is the Farley File. Developed by Franklin Roosevelt's campaign manager, James Farley, the Farley File was a comprehensive set of records detailing political and personal facts about people FDR and Farley met or were supposed to meet. Using it, people that FDR met were impressed by his ""recall"" of facts about their family and what they were doing professionally and politically.[7] In 1982, Kate and Robert D. Kestenbaum introduced the concept of database marketing, namely applying statistical methods to analyze and gather customer data.[8] By 1987, Pat Sullivan and Mike Muhney had released a customer evaluation system called ACT! based on the principle of a digital Rolodex, which offered a contact management service for the first time.[9]
The trend was followed by numerous companies and independent developers trying to maximize lead potential, including Tom Siebel of Siebel Systems, who designed the first CRM product, Siebel Customer Relationship Management, in 1993.[10] In order to compete with these new and quickly growing stand-alone CRM solutions, established enterprise resource planning (ERP) software companies like Oracle, Zoho Corporation,[11] SAP,[12] Peoplesoft (an Oracle subsidiary as of 2005)[13] and Navision[14] started extending their sales, distribution and customer service capabilities with embedded CRM modules. This included embedding sales force automation or extended customer service (e.g. inquiry, activity management) as CRM features in their ERP.
Customer relationship management was popularized in 1997 due to the work of Siebel, Gartner, and IBM. Between 1997 and 2000, leading CRM products were enriched with shipping and marketing capabilities.[15] Siebel introduced the first mobile CRM app called Siebel Sales Handheld in 1999. The idea of a stand-alone, cloud-hosted customer base was soon adopted by other leading providers at the time, including PeopleSoft (acquired by Oracle),[13] Oracle, SAP and Salesforce.com.[16]
The first open-source CRM system was developed by SugarCRM in 2004. During this period, CRM was rapidly migrating to the cloud, as a result of which it became accessible to sole entrepreneurs and small teams. This increase in accessibility generated a huge wave of price reduction.[15] Around 2009, developers began considering the options to profit from social media's momentum and designed tools to help companies become accessible on all users' favourite networks. Many startups at the time benefited from this trend to provide exclusively social CRM solutions, including Base and Nutshell.[15] The same year, Gartner organized and held the first Customer Relationship Management Summit, and summarized the features systems should offer to be classified as CRM solutions.[17] In 2013 and 2014, most of the popular CRM products were linked to business intelligence systems and communication software to improve corporate communication and end-users' experience. The leading trend is to replace standardized CRM solutions with industry-specific ones, or to make them customizable enough to meet the needs of every business.[18] In November 2016, Forrester released a report where it ""identified the nine most significant CRM suites from eight prominent vendors"".[19]
Strategic CRM concentrates upon the development of a customer-centric business culture.[20]
The focus of a business on being customer-centric (in design and implementation of their CRM strategy) will translate into an improved CLV.[21]
The primary goal of CRM systems is integration and automation of sales, marketing, and customer support. Therefore, these systems typically have a dashboard that gives an overall view of the three functions on a single customer view, a single page for each customer that a company may have. The dashboard may provide client information, past sales, previous marketing efforts, and more, summarizing all of the relationships between the customer and the firm. Operational CRM is made up of three main components: sales force automation, marketing automation, and service automation.[22]
The role of analytical CRM systems is to analyze customer data collected through multiple sources and present it so that business managers can make more informed decisions.[26] Analytical CRM systems use techniques such as data mining, correlation, and pattern recognition to analyze customer data. These analytics help improve customer service by finding small problems which can be solved, perhaps by marketing to different parts of a consumer audience differently.[22] For example, through the analysis of a customer base's buying behavior, a company might see that this customer base has not been buying a lot of products recently. After reviewing their data, the company might think to market to this subset of consumers differently to best communicate how this company's products might benefit this group specifically.
The third primary aim of CRM systems is to incorporate external stakeholders such as suppliers, vendors, and distributors, and share customer information across groups/departments and organizations. For example, feedback can be collected from technical support calls, which could help provide direction for marketing products and services to that particular customer in the future.[27]
A customer data platform (CDP) is a computer system used by marketing departments that assembles data about individual people from various sources into one database, with which other software systems can interact.[28]  As of February 2017[update], about twenty companies were selling such systems and revenue for them was around US$300 million.[28]
The main components of CRM are building and managing customer relationships through marketing, observing relationships as they mature through distinct phases, managing these relationships at each stage and recognizing that the distribution of the value of a relationship to the firm is not homogeneous. When building and managing customer relationships through marketing, firms might benefit from using a variety of tools to help organizational design, incentive schemes, customer structures, and more to optimize the reach of their marketing campaigns. Through the acknowledgment of the distinct phases of CRM, businesses will be able to benefit from seeing the interaction of multiple relationships as connected transactions. The final factor of CRM highlights the importance of CRM through accounting for the profitability of customer relationships. By studying the particular spending habits of customers, a firm may be able to dedicate different resources and amounts of attention to different types of consumers.[29]
Relational Intelligence, which is the awareness of the variety of relationships a customer can have with a firm and the ability of the firm to reinforce or change those connections, is an important component of the main phases of CRM. Companies may be good at capturing demographic data, such as gender, age, income, and education, and connecting them with purchasing information to categorize customers into profitability tiers, but this is only a firm's industrial view of customer relationships.[30] A lack of relational intelligence is a sign that firms still see customers as resources that can be used for up-sell or cross-sell opportunities, rather than people looking for interesting and personalized interactions.[31]
CRM systems include:
Customer satisfaction has important implications for the economic performance of firms because it has the ability to increase customer loyalty and usage behavior and reduce customer complaints and the likelihood of customer defection.[33][34] The implementation of a CRM approach is likely to affect customer satisfaction and customer knowledge for a variety of different reasons.
Firstly, firms can customize their offerings for each customer.[35] By accumulating information across customer interactions and processing this information to discover hidden patterns, CRM applications help firms customize their offerings to suit the individual tastes of their customers.[35] This customization enhances the perceived quality of products and services from a customer's viewpoint, and because the perceived quality is a determinant of customer satisfaction, it follows that CRM applications indirectly affect customer satisfaction. CRM applications also enable firms to provide timely, accurate processing of customer orders and requests and the ongoing management of customer accounts.[35] For example, Piccoli and Applegate discuss how Wyndham uses IT tools to deliver a consistent service experience across its various properties to a customer. Both an improved ability to customize and reduced variability of the consumption experience enhance perceived quality, which in turn positively affects customer satisfaction.[36] CRM applications also help firms manage customer relationships more effectively across the stages of relationship initiation, maintenance, and termination.[36]
With CRM systems, customers are served on the day-to-day process. With more reliable information, their demand for self-service from companies will decrease. If there is less need to interact with the company for different problems, then the customer satisfaction level is expected to increase.[37] These central benefits of CRM will be connected hypothetically to the three kinds of equity, which are relationship, value, and brand, and in the end to customer equity. Eight benefits were recognized to provide value drivers.[38]
Research has found a 5% increase in customer retention boosts lifetime customer[clarification needed] profits by 50% on average across multiple industries, as well as a boost of up to 90% within specific industries such as insurance.[39] Companies that have mastered customer relationship strategies have the most successful CRM programs. For example, MBNA Europe has had a 75% annual profit growth since 1995. The firm heavily invests in screening potential cardholders. Once proper clients are identified, the firm retains 97% of its profitable customers. They implement CRM by marketing the right products to the right customers. The firm's customers' card usage is 52% above the industry norm, and the average expenditure is 30% more per transaction. Also 10% of their account holders ask for more information on cross-sale products.[39]
Amazon has also seen successes through its customer proposition. The firm implemented personal greetings, collaborative filtering, and more for the customer. They also used CRM training for the employees to see up to 80% of customers repeat.[39]
A customer profile is a detailed description of any particular classification of customer which is created to represent the typical users of a product or service. Customer profiling is a method to understand your customers in terms of demographics, behaviour and lifestyle. It is used to help make customer-focused decisions without confusing the scope of the project with personal opinion. Overall profiling is gathering information that sums up consumption habits so far and projects them into the future so that they can be grouped for marketing and advertising purposes.[40]
Customer or consumer profiles are the essences of the data that is collected alongside core data (name, address, company) and processed through customer analytics methods, essentially a type of profiling. 
The three basic methods of customer profiling are the psychographic approach, the consumer typology approach, and the consumer characteristics approach. These customer profiling methods help you design your business around who your customers are and help you make better customer-centered decisions.
Consultants hold that it is important for companies to establish strong CRM systems to improve their relational intelligence.[41] According to this argument, a company must recognize that people have many different types of relationships with different brands. One research study analyzed relationships between consumers in China, Germany, Spain, and the United States, with over 200 brands in 11 industries including airlines, cars, and media. This information is valuable as it provides demographic, behavioral, and value-based customer segmentation. These types of relationships can be both positive and negative. Some customers view themselves as friends of the brands, while others as enemies, and some are mixed with a love-hate relationship with the brand. Some relationships are distant, intimate, or anything in between.[31]
Managers must understand the different reasons for the types of relationships, and provide the customer with what they are looking for. Companies can collect this information by using surveys, interviews, and more, with current customers. 
Companies must also improve the relational intelligence of their CRM systems. Companies store and receive huge amounts of data through emails, online chat sessions, phone calls, and more.[42] Many companies do not properly make use of this great amount of data, however. All of these are signs of what types of relationships the customer wants with the firm, and therefore companies may consider investing more time and effort in building out their relational intelligence.[30] Companies can use data mining technologies and web searches to understand relational signals. Social media such as social networking sites, blogs, and forums can also be used to collect and analyze information. Understanding the customer and capturing this data allows companies to convert customers' signals into information and knowledge that the firm can use to understand a potential customer's desired relations with a brand.[43]
Many firms have also implemented training programs to teach employees how to recognize and create strong customer-brand relationships. Other employees have also been trained in social psychology and the social sciences to help bolster customer relationships. Customer service representatives must be trained to value customer relationships and trained to understand existing customer profiles. Even the finance and legal departments should understand how to manage and build relationships with customers.[44]
Contact centre CRM providers are popular for small and mid-market businesses. These systems codify the interactions between the company and customers by using analytics and key performance indicators to give the users information on where to focus their marketing and customer service. This allows agents to have access to a caller's history to provide personalized customer communication. The intention is to maximize average revenue per user, decrease churn rate and decrease idle and unproductive contact with the customers.[45][46][47]
Growing in popularity is the idea of gamifying, or using game design elements and game principles in a non-game environment such as customer service environments. The gamification of customer service environments includes providing elements found in games like rewards and bonus points to customer service representatives as a method of feedback for a job well done.[48]
Gamification tools can motivate agents by tapping into their desire for rewards, recognition, achievements, and competition.[49]
Contact-center automation,  CCA, the practice of having an integrated system that coordinates contacts between an organization and the public, is designed to reduce the repetitive and tedious parts of a contact center agent's job. Automation prevents this by having pre-recorded audio messages that help customers solve their problems. For example, an automated contact center may be able to re-route a customer through a series of commands asking him or her to select a certain number to speak with a particular contact center agent who specializes in the field in which the customer has a question.[50] Software tools can also integrate with the agent's desktop tools to handle customer questions and requests. This also saves time on behalf of the employees.[25]
Social CRM involves the use of social media and technology to engage and learn from consumers.[51] Because the public, especially young people, are increasingly using social networking sites, companies use[31] these sites to draw attention to their products, services and brands, with the aim of building up customer relationships to increase demand. With the increase in the use of social media platforms, integrating CRM with the help of social media can potentially be a quicker and more cost-friendly process.[52]
Some CRM systems integrate social media sites like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook to track and communicate with customers. These customers also share their own opinions and experiences with a company's products and services, giving these firms more insight. Therefore, these firms can both share their own opinions and also track the opinions of their customers.[27]
Enterprise feedback management software platforms combine internal survey data with trends identified through social media to allow businesses to make more accurate decisions on which products to supply.[53]
CRM systems can also include technologies that create geographic marketing campaigns. The systems take in information based on a customer's physical location and sometimes integrates it with popular location-based GPS applications. It can be used for networking or contact management as well to help increase sales based on location.[25]
Despite the general notion that CRM systems were created for customer-centric businesses, they can also be applied to B2B environments to streamline and improve customer management conditions. For the best level of CRM operation in a B2B environment, the software must be personalized and delivered at individual levels.[54]
The main differences between business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business CRM systems concern aspects like sizing of contact databases and length of relationships.[55]
In the Gartner CRM Summit 2010 challenges like ""system tries to capture data from social networking traffic like Twitter, handles Facebook page addresses or other online social networking sites"" were discussed and solutions were provided that would help in bringing more clientele.[56]
The era of the ""social customer"" refers to the use of social media by customers.[57]
Some CRM systems are equipped with mobile capabilities, making information accessible to remote sales staff.[58][59][60]
Many CRM vendors offer subscription-based web tools (cloud computing) and SaaS. Salesforce.com was the first company to provide enterprise applications through a web browser, and has maintained its leadership position.[61] Over the years, the number of SaaS providers has grown with CRM being the leading category for 2024.[62]
Traditional providers moved into the cloud-based market via acquisitions of smaller providers: Oracle purchased RightNow in October 2011,[63] and Taleo[64] and Eloqua[65] in 2012; SAP acquired SuccessFactors in December 2011[66] and NetSuite acquired Verenia in 2022.[67]
Sales forces also play an important role in CRM, as maximizing sales effectiveness and increasing sales productivity is a driving force behind the adoption of CRM software. Some of the top CRM trends identified in 2021 include focusing on customer service automation such as chatbots, hyper-personalization based on customer data and insights, and the use of unified CRM systems.[68][69] CRM vendors support sales productivity with different products, such as tools that measure the effectiveness of ads that appear in 3D video games.[70]
Pharmaceutical companies were some of the first investors in sales force automation (SFA) and some are on their third- or fourth-generation implementations. However, until recently, the deployments did not extend beyond SFA—limiting their scope and interest to Gartner analysts.[71]
Another related development is vendor relationship management (VRM), which provide tools and services that allow customers to manage their individual relationship with vendors. VRM development has grown out of efforts by ProjectVRM at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society and Identity Commons' Internet Identity Workshops, as well as by a growing number of startups and established companies. VRM was the subject of a cover story in the May 2010 issue of CRM Magazine.[72]
Another trend worth noting is the rise of Customer Success as a discipline within companies. More and more companies establish Customer Success teams as separate from the traditional Sales team and task them with managing existing customer relations. This trend fuels demand for additional capabilities for a more holistic understanding of customer health, which is a limitation for many existing vendors in the space.[73] As a result, a growing number of new entrants enter the market while existing vendors add capabilities in this area to their suites.
In 2017, artificial intelligence and predictive analytics were identified as the newest trends in CRM.[74]
Companies face large challenges when trying to implement CRM systems. Consumer companies frequently manage their customer relationships haphazardly and unprofitably.[75] They may not effectively or adequately use their connections with their customers, due to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of a CRM system's analysis. Clients may be treated like an exchange party, rather than a unique individual, due to, occasionally, a lack of a bridge between the CRM data and the CRM analysis output. Many studies show that customers are frequently frustrated by a company's inability to meet their relationship expectations, and on the other side, companies do not always know how to translate the data they have gained from CRM software into a feasible action plan.[31] In 2003, a Gartner report estimated that more than $2 billion had been spent on software that was not being used. According to CSO Insights, less than 40 percent of 1,275 participating companies had end-user adoption rates above 90 percent.[76] Many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial or fragmented basis.[77] In a 2007 survey from the UK, four-fifths of senior executives reported that their biggest challenge is getting their staff to use the systems they had installed. Forty-three percent of respondents said they use less than half the functionality of their existing systems.[78] However, market research regarding consumers' preferences may increase the adoption of CRM among developing countries' consumers.[79]
Collection of customer data such as personally identifiable information must strictly obey customer privacy laws, which often requires extra expenditures on legal support.
Part of the paradox with CRM stems from the challenge of determining exactly what CRM is and what it can do for a company.[80] The CRM paradox, also referred to as the ""dark side of CRM"",[81] may entail favoritism and differential treatment of some customers. This can happen because a business prioritizes customers who are more profitable, more relationship-orientated or tend to have increased loyalty to the company. Although focusing on such customers by itself is not a bad thing, it can leave other customers feeling left out and alienated potentially decreasing profits because of it.[82]
CRM technologies can easily become ineffective if there is no proper management, and they are not implemented correctly. The data sets must also be connected, distributed, and organized properly so that the users can access the information that they need quickly and easily. Research studies also show that customers are increasingly becoming dissatisfied with contact center experiences due to lags and wait times. They also request and demand multiple channels of communication with a company, and these channels must transfer information seamlessly. Therefore, it is increasingly important for companies to deliver a cross-channel customer experience that can be both consistent as well as reliable.[25]

Patreon (/ˈpeɪtriɒn/, /-ən/) is a monetization platform operated by Patreon, Inc., that provides business tools for content creators to run a subscription service and sell digital products. It helps artists and other creators  earn a recurring income by providing rewards and perks to its subscribers. Patreon charges a commission of 8 to 12 percent of creators' monthly income, in addition to payment processing fees.
Patreon is used by writers, videographers, webcomic artists, video game developers, podcasters, musicians, adult content creators,[3] and other kinds of creators who post regularly online.[4] It allows artists to receive funding directly from their fans, or patrons, on a recurring basis or per work of art.[5] The company is based in San Francisco.[6]
Patreon, Inc., was co-founded in May 2013 by developer Sam Yam and musician Jack Conte,[7][8] who was looking for a way to make a living from his YouTube videos.[9] It developed a platform that allowed 'patrons' to pay a set amount of money every time an artist created a work of art. The company raised $2.1 million in August 2013 from a group of venture capitalists and angel investors.[10][11] In June 2014, Patreon raised a further $15 million in a series A round led by Danny Rimer of Index Ventures.[12][13] In January 2016, the company closed on a fresh round of $30 million in a series B round, led by Thrive Capital, which put the total raised for Patreon at $47.1 million.[14]
It signed up more than 125,000 ""patrons"" in its first 18 months.[15] In late 2014, the website announced that patrons were sending over $1,000,000 per month to the site's content creators.[16]
In March 2015, Patreon acquired Subbable, a similar voluntary subscription service created by the Green brothers, and absorbed Subbable creators' pages and content. Notably CGP Grey, Destin Sandlin's Smarter Every Day, and the Green brothers' own CrashCourse and SciShow channels.[17] The merger was consequent to an expected migration of payment systems with Amazon Payments that Subbable used.
In October 2015, the site was the target of a large cyber-attack, with almost 15 gigabytes of password data, donation records, and source code taken and published. The breach exposed more than 2.3 million unique e-mail addresses and millions of private messages.[18][19] Following the attack, some patrons received extortion emails demanding Bitcoin payments in exchange for the protection of their personal information.[20][21][22]
In January 2017, Patreon announced that it had sent over $100,000,000 to creators since its inception.[23]
In May 2017, Patreon announced that it had over 50,000 active creators and 1 million monthly patrons, and was on track to send over $150 million to creators in 2017.[24] In June 2017, Patreon announced a suite of tools for creators to run membership businesses on the Patreon platform. Notable improvements included a customer relationship management system, a mobile app called Lens, and a service to set up exclusive livestreams.[25]
In August 2018, Patreon announced the acquisition of Memberful, a membership services company.[26]
In April 2020, citing the COVID-19 pandemic as a means of financial difficulty for the economy, the company laid off 30 employees or 13% of its workforce at the time.[27] In April 2021, the company laid off 36 employees or 13% of its workforce despite reporting recent growth.[28] In October 2021, Patreon confirmed it was looking into implementing cryptocurrencies and NFTs after creators expressed interests in having the opportunity to offer exclusive memberships and benefits to its patrons through a coin or token.[29]
In March 2022, Patreon announced that it had more than 250,000 creators who were using the platform, and there were more than eight million active patrons from more than 200 countries.[30]
In September 2022, Patreon announced it was laying off 80 people, representing about 17% of its staff.[31][32] As part of the layoffs, the company also announced that it would be closing its Dublin and Berlin offices.[33]
In October 2023, Patreon announced a full redesign of its interface and brand identity, including new features like community chats.[34] Patreon also announced the acquisition of Moment, a ticketed live streaming platform.[35]
Patreon users are grouped by content type, such as video/films, podcast, comedy, comics, games, and education. These content creators set up a page on the Patreon website, where patrons can choose to pay a fixed amount to a creator on a monthly basis.[36] Alternatively, content creators can configure their page so that patrons pay every time the artist releases a new piece of art. A creator typically displays a goal that the ongoing revenue will go towards, and can set a maximum limit of how much they receive per month. Patrons can cancel their payment at any time. Creators typically provide membership benefits (commonly in the form of exclusive content or behind-the-scenes work) for their patrons, depending on the amount that each patron pays.[37][38]
Patrons can unlock monetary tiers that increase the content type they see from the user. Several content creators on Patreon are also YouTubers. They can create content on multiple platforms, and while the YouTube videos may be available to the public, the patrons receive private content made exclusively for them in exchange for aiding the Patreon user's goal.[39] Patreon takes an 8-12% commission on pledges. As of May 2017[update], the average pledge per patron was around $12, and a new patron pledged to a creator every 5.5 seconds.[40]
As of 2022[update], the four most popular content categories are videos, podcasts, music, and gaming, which collectively make up about half of all Patreon profiles. A quarter of the artists on Patreon produce videos, while podcasts, music, and gaming represent about 7% each.
[41]
As of March 2025[update], Patreon's Community Guidelines allow nudity and suggestive imagery as long as the page is categorized as Adult/18+, with the condition that all works must feature adults who demonstrate consent.[42]
In June 2025, Patreon announced a change to its pricing structure, charging creators 10% of their earnings.[43]
In December 2017, Patreon announced a service fee starting on December 18, 2017, where some fees would be charged to the patrons rather than all fees being paid by the creator. This caused a backlash from several creators, including some who saw members of their fanbase withdraw small pledges in response. Under the new payment model, a $1 pledge would have cost a patron $1.38, and a $5 pledge would have cost $5.50, representing a 38% and 10% rise respectively.[44] Due to this backlash and the loss of many pledges for creators, Patreon announced that it would not be rolling out these changes, and apologized to its users.[45]
Unlike other online platforms such as YouTube and Facebook, which use trained algorithms to identify potentially inappropriate content, Patreon's trust and safety team monitors users and investigates complaints of Terms of Service violations.[46]
In July 2017, right-wing YouTube personality Lauren Southern was banned from Patreon over concerns about Génération Identitaire's blocking of NGO ships in the Mediterranean, ferrying migrants to Europe off the Libyan coast. A letter she received from Patreon said she was removed for ""raising funds in order to take part in activities that are likely to cause loss of life,"" referring to an incident in May involving Southern, and the larger Defend Europe mission in July, which she covered on YouTube. Philosopher, writer, and podcast host Sam Harris, who also received contributions from patrons on the website, objected to Patreon's approach and announced that he would be leaving the platform because of it.[47] Shortly thereafter Patreon deleted the account of It's Going Down, a far-left news website, for allegedly doxing.[48]
In September 2018, Patreon banned Turkish journalist-in-exile Kamil Maman after Turkey threatened to block the entire site in Turkey if the company did not comply. In an e-mail sent to Maman, Patreon said ""This was not an easy decision for [us], as we are huge proponents of free speech, but it was a decision we made in order to best protect access to Turkish creators."" Maman condemned Patreon for giving in to the demands of an autocratic regime.[49]
In December 2018, Patreon banned Milo Yiannopoulos a day after he created an account and also banned Carl Benjamin because he used homophobic and racist slurs in a YouTube interview in February 2018.[46] Benjamin said that Patreon had taken his words out of context[50] and that ""the video in question should not fall under Patreon's rules because it was on YouTube.""[46]
This ban was criticized by Sam Harris and some American libertarians, who have accused it of being politically motivated.[46] Furthermore, Jordan Peterson announced a plan to launch an alternative service that will be safe from political interference, and jointly announced with Dave Rubin in a January 1, 2019, video that they will be leaving Patreon by January 15, 2019, as a direct response to its treatment of Carl Benjamin and has since effected that change.[51][52]
Patreon banned comedian Owen Benjamin following alleged hate speech. Benjamin filed an arbitration claim for $2.2 million (later upped to $3.5 million) and told fans to file identical claims against Patreon as required by the Terms of Use in an attempt to pressure them into a settlement. Benjamin said that the suit(s) had a basis due to a disrupted economic relationship. Patreon launched a counter-suit against 72 individuals who filed arbitration claims and sought a preliminary injunction to stay all arbitration proceedings pending the outcome of its counter-suit. The injunction was denied, meaning that Patreon may be required to prefund the arbitration claims against itself up to $10,000 per claim. Patreon had previously changed its terms of service on January 1, 2020, to end the conditions under which the suits attempted by Benjamin's supporters (but not himself) occurred, as the lawsuits were filed on January 6. The terms-of-service update stated that only the person banned from the platform would be allowed to file a complaint and that any arbitration fees would have to be paid by the person or entity filing the complaint. The suits open the door to lawsuits from supporters of other Patreon users banned from the platform, with freelance journalist Lauren Southern preparing her suit.[53][54]
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Patreon maintained its business in Russia despite international pressure on western companies operating in Russia to cease operating there.[55][56] At the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Patreon closed a major Ukrainian account run by a charity named Comeback Alive, which raised money for helping volunteers and veteran divisions due to its financing and training of military personnel.[57] On February 15, 2024, Patreon deleted the account of Artur Rehi,[58] an Estonian military video blogger. Patreon stated ""hate speech"" as one of the reasons for the deletion, due to Rehi's reference to the Russians in occupied Ukraine as ""Occupiers"". The other reason was ""funding military"", despite Rehi's funneling of all donations through Rotary Club.[59]
In March 2014, Patreon announced via email that creators of sexual content on its platform would no longer be allowed to use PayPal services through Patreon to fulfill subscription payments.[60] In July 2016, Patreon emailed its content creators announcing that payments through PayPal would resume for adult-oriented creators.[61] Those who worked within the ""Not Safe For Work"" categories on Patreon could accept payments through PayPal via PayPal's subsidiary Braintree.[48] In October 2017, Patreon reverted its stance on NSFW content, introducing new restrictions.[62] It published an expanded version of the community guidelines with a broader definition of sexual content, triggering a backlash from some adult content creators.[63][64][65] A petition in protest of the changes gathered 1,800 signatures, which drew a response from Jack Conte.[66][67] In June 2018, Patreon suspended some creators who produced adult content.[68]
Since its inception, Patreon has been widely criticized for its approach on handling and removing child sexual abuse material either drawn, photographed, or filmed. In March 2018, a petition that gathered nearly 37,000 signatures demanded that the company prohibit animators and artists from selling content depicting child rape.[69]
In August 2021, an Australian news agency reported that Patreon was hosting sexual content of children under 18 filmed in a psychiatric hospital in Prague, Czech Republic.[70] In May 2022, social media influencer Michael McWhorter said he found sexually provocative pictures and videos of pre-pubescent children on Patreon categorized as NSFW and requiring the customer to be 18 years or older to view or purchase such content.[71] In September 2022, following the laying off of several members of the Patreon security team, McWhorter published a follow-up video featuring a testimony from another user that she had reported CSAM she found to Patreon staff and it simply dismissed any concerns.[72][73][71] Patreon rejected the statements, dismissing them as ""dangerous and conspiratorial disinformation"".[74][75][71]
In March 2023, Patreon announced its partnership with Tech Coalition, an internet agency with aims to combat child sexual exploitation and online child abuse.[76] A few months later in June 2023, an investigation by the BBC discovered AI-generated sexual abuse images of children for sale on the website. Patreon eventually removed the accounts in question.[77]
In 2018, Patreon was accused of cracking down on ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) videos.[78] On October 24, 2020, Patreon announced that it would ban all accounts ""that advance disinformation promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory"".[79]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_of_Open_Access_Books,Open-access monograph,"An open-access monograph (open-access book or OA book) is a scholarly publication usually made openly available online with an open license.[1][2] These books are freely accessible to the public, typically via the internet. They are part of the open access movement.[3]
Open access is when academic research is made freely available online for anyone to read and re-use.[4] As with open access journals, there are different business models for funding open-access books, including publication charges, institutional support, library publishing, and consortium models.[5] Some publishers, like OECD Publishing, uses a freemium model where the ebook version is made available for free, but readers have the option to purchase a print copy. Sales of the print version subsidise the cost of producing the book.[5] There is some evidence that making electronic editions of books open access can increase sales of the print edition.[6]
While open access to journal articles has become very common, with 50% of articles published in 2011 available as open access,[7] open access to books has not yet seen as much uptake at this time.[8] However, some dedicated open-access book publishers, such as Open Book Publishers, Punctum Books, and others who publish both books and journals like Open Humanities Press,[9] have been launched.
Gradually, academic publishers and university presses have also adopted an open-access monograph approach, offering this publishing option alongside journal articles. Major publishers of open-access books include, for example, Taylor & Francis,[10] MDPI,[11] and MIT Press.[12] The OAPEN (Open Access Publishing in European Networks) online library and publication platform provides access to thousands of peer-reviewed academic books, mainly in the humanities and social sciences. The OAPEN Foundation[13] also provides a directory of open access works via Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB).[14]
A report released in 2015 by the UK's main funding body for research, the Higher Education Funding Council for England, states the importance of open access monographs:[15] ""Monographs are a vitally important and distinctive vehicle for research communication, and must be sustained in any moves to open access.""[16] A 2019 survey has shown that a majority of authors agree that all future scholarly books should be made available via open access.[17] A 2023 study found that, out of 396,995 open access books analyzed, only 19% were archived, raising concerns about the longevity and accessibility of many OA books distributed online.[18]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_80s,MTV 80s,"MTV 80s is a channel featuring music videos from the 1980s. It has a commercial-free schedule.
From 28 February to 31 March 2020, MTV 80s was broadcast for one month as a themed alternative to its host channel, MTV Classic UK, but was not planned as a full-time replacement. From 30 June 2020, until 5 October 2020, VH1 Classic Europe broadcast a block of MTV 80s programming from midnight until midday as a test bed for what would eventually become the permanent replacement to VH1 Classic Europe.
MTV 80s broadcasts around the clock in New Zealand since 1 July 2020 and Australia since 1 August 2023 replacing MTV Classic. On 5 October 2020, from 05:00 CET onwards, MTV 80s started broadcasting full-time, replacing VH1 Classic in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean.
The channel closed in Australia on November 1, 2025. [2]
On 31 December 2025, MTV 80s will shut down globally[3], due the company's restructuring policy.
As part of restructuring at Paramount Global UK & Australia, MTV 80s replaced MTV Classic in the UK from 6am on 31 March 2022.[4]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Music,Paramount Music,"Paramount Music is an American record label. Since 2015, it has served as the in-house label for film and television music across all divisions of Paramount Pictures.[1]
The label is distributed by TuneCore, and it is the second in-house label for Paramount Pictures. Paramount Records had earlier operated between 1969 and 1974, releasing soundtracks for Paramount properties, along with several non-film and television related albums by contemporary artists.
Paramount Music occasionally releases soundtracks for older Paramount titles, branded as ""Paramount Classics"" releases.[1] So far, it has not released soundtracks for the titles Paramount acquired from DreamWorks Pictures, Miramax and Republic Pictures. However, it has done soundtracks for in-house sequels to films from those studios, including Gladiator II (whose predecessor was a DreamWorks film) and Scream VI (originally a Miramax franchise).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCCO-TV,WCCO-TV,"
WCCO-TV (channel 4), branded CBS Minnesota, is a television station licensed to Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, serving the Twin Cities area. It is owned and operated by the CBS television network through its CBS News and Stations division, and maintains studios on South 11th Street along Nicollet Mall in downtown Minneapolis; its transmitter is located at the Telefarm complex in Shoreview, Minnesota.
WCCO-TV's programming is also seen on full-power satellite station KCCW-TV (channel 12) in Walker (with transmitter near Hackensack). Nielsen Media Research treats WCCO-TV and KCCW-TV as one station in local ratings books, using the identifier name WCCO+. From 1987 until 2017, WCCO-TV operated a second satellite, KCCO-TV (virtual and VHF digital channel 7) in Alexandria (with transmitter near Westport).
WCCO is one of three owned-and-operated network affiliates in the Twin Cities market, the others being Fox O&O KMSP-TV (channel 9) and MyNetworkTV O&O WFTC (channel 9.2).
WCCO-TV's roots originate with a radio station, but not WCCO (830 AM). WRHM, which signed on the air in 1925, is the radio station to which WCCO-TV traces its lineage. In 1934, two newspapers—the Minneapolis Tribune and the Saint Paul Pioneer Press-Dispatch—formed a joint venture by the name of ""Twin Cities Newspapers"", which purchased the radio station and changed its call letters to WTCN. Twin Cities Newspapers later expanded into the fledgling FM band with WTCN-FM, and shortly thereafter to the then-new medium of television with the launch of WTCN-TV on July 1, 1949, becoming Minnesota's second television station, broadcasting from the Radio City Theater at 50 South 9th Street in downtown Minneapolis. The station's first president was Robert Ridder.[2] Channel 4 has been a primary CBS affiliate since its sign on; it is the only major commercial station in the Minneapolis–St. Paul market not to have changed its primary affiliation. However, it had a secondary affiliation with ABC during its early years, from 1949 to 1953,[3] until a new station using the WTCN-TV calls (now KARE-TV) picked up the ABC affiliation, retaining it from its 1953 sign on until 1961 when it became an independent station; it has been affiliated with NBC since 1979.
Twin Cities Newspapers sold off its broadcast holdings in 1952, with channel 4 going to the Murphy and McNally families, who had recently bought the Twin Cities' dominant radio station, WCCO, from CBS. The stations merged under a new company, Midwest Radio and Television, with CBS as a minority partner. The call letters of channel 4 were changed to WCCO-TV to match its new radio sibling on August 17 (the WTCN-TV call sign appeared again in the market the following year on the new channel 11).[4] CBS was forced to sell its minority ownership stake in the WCCO stations in 1954 to comply with Federal Communications Commission ownership limits of the time.
In 1959, WCCO became the first station in the Midwest to have a videotape machine; it came at a cost of $50,000 and one part-time employee was hired to operate the machine.[5]
On July 23, 1962, WCCO-TV was involved in the world's first live international broadcast via the Telstar satellite; the station's mobile units provided the feed for all three networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC, for a program originating from native land in the Black Hills showing Mount Rushmore to the world.
The station began telecasting color programs in 1955. In September 1983, WCCO relocated its operations from its original studios on South 9th Street to the present location at South 11th Street and Nicollet Mall. The network gained full ownership of WCCO-TV in 1992, when it acquired what was by then known as Midwest Communications.[6] In 2000, Viacom bought CBS, and WCCO became part of the Viacom Television Stations Group. In 2006, Viacom Television Stations Group was renamed CBS Television Stations when Viacom split into two companies.
During the 1980s, a cable-exclusive sibling station was created to supplement WCCO, with its own slate of local and national entertainment programming. This was known as WCCO II, but by 1989, it had evolved into the Midwest Sports Channel, focusing on regional sporting events. It continued under CBS ownership until 2000, when it was announced that MSC and sibling RSN Home Team Sports were to be sold. HTS went to Comcast, while MSC was sold to Fox Entertainment Group and became Fox Sports North, a part of Fox Sports Net. MSC had been an FSN affiliate since 1997.
On February 2, 2017, CBS agreed to sell CBS Radio to Entercom, currently the fourth-largest radio broadcasting company in the United States. The sale was completed on November 17, 2017,[7] and was conducted using a Reverse Morris Trust so that it was tax-free. While CBS shareholders retained a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom, now Audacy, is the surviving entity, with WCCO radio and its sibling stations separated from WCCO-TV.[8][9]
On August 13, 2019, National Amusements announced that Viacom and CBS Corporation would recombine their assets, forming the entity ViacomCBS. The sale was completed on December 4, 2019, resulting in CBS Television Stations, including WCCO-TV, becoming subsidiaries of ViacomCBS. On February 16, 2022, ViacomCBS changed its name to Paramount Global.
On August 14, 2023, Wendy McMahon, a former creative services director at WCCO-TV, was named CBS News and Stations president.
In 1961, with the establishment of the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League, the station, via CBS, which held the rights to broadcast NFL games, became the 'unofficial' home station of the team. This partnership continued through the 1993 season, at which time most games were moved to WFTC. Today, most Vikings games are on KMSP-TV; since 1998, WCCO airs at least two Vikings games each season when the Vikings host an AFC team, or, since 2014, with the institution of the new 'cross-flex' rules, any games that are moved from KMSP-TV. In 1992, WCCO provided coverage of Super Bowl XXVI and that year's Final Four, which were hosted at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome.
Since 2023, WCCO has aired select Minnesota Golden Gophers football games as a part of a new deal between CBS and the Big Ten Conference.
WCCO presently[when?] broadcasts 38+1⁄2 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6+1⁄2 hours each weekday and three hours each on Saturdays and Sundays).[citation needed] WCCO leads the Twin Cities market in nearly all time slots, from its morning show to the 10 p.m. news. WCCO leads by large margins in overall households, though compared to the 25–54 demographic, the numbers are much more competitive with NBC affiliate KARE.
WCCO began broadcasting local newscasts in high-definition on May 28, 2009, becoming the third major network station in the Twin Cities (behind KARE and KMSP) to do so.
WCCO-TV launched a streaming news service, CBSN Minnesota (now CBS News Minnesota) on December 12, 2019, as part of a rollout of similar services (each a localized version of the national CBSN service across the CBS-owned stations).[10]
On September 5, 2022, WCCO premiered an hour-long 4 pm newscast called The 4.[11][12]
The stations' signals are multiplexed:
WCCO-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 32,[16] using virtual channel 4.
As part of the SAFER Act, WCCO-TV kept its analog signal on the air until July 12 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.[17]
WCCO-TV operates a satellite station northwest of the Twin Cities area:
It formerly operated a second satellite station:
Both of these stations were founded by the Central Minnesota Television Company and maintained primary affiliations with NBC and secondary affiliations with ABC from their respective sign-ons until the summer of 1982, when both stations switched to CBS.[18][19] KCMT had originally broadcast from a studio in Alexandria, with KNMT operating as a satellite station of KCMT. Central Minnesota Television sold both stations to Midwest Radio and Television in 1987, at which point they adopted their present call letters and became semi-satellites of WCCO-TV.[20]
Until 2002, the two stations simulcast WCCO-TV's programming for most of the day, except for separate commercials and inserts placed into channel 4's newscasts. However, in 2002, WCCO-TV ended KCCO/KCCW's local operations and shut down the Alexandria studio, converting the two stations into full-time satellites. Since then, channel 4 has identified as ""Minneapolis–St. Paul/Alexandria/Walker"", with virtually no on-air evidence that KCCO and KCCW were separate stations.
CBS sold KCCO's spectrum in the FCC's spectrum incentive auction, but was expected to engage in a channel-sharing agreement.[21] In a request for a waiver of requirements that KCCO broadcast public service announcements related to the shutdown (as the station no longer had the capability to originate separate programming, such announcements would also need to air on WCCO-TV and KCCW-TV despite not being relevant outside of KCCO's viewing area; CBS inserted a crawl at the KCCO transmitter for broadcast every fifteen minutes), CBS disclosed that KCCO would shut down December 30, 2017. WCCO-TV remains available on cable and satellite providers in the Alexandria area; Selective TV, Inc., a local translator collective, announced on December 22, 2017, that it had struck a deal to add WCCO to its lineup.[22][23][24]
In addition, the broadcast signal of WCCO-TV is extended by way of eight translators:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom_(website),Fandom (website),"
Fandom[b] (formerly known as Wikicities and Wikia)[c] is a media conglomerate backed by the private equity firm TPG Capital. The website offers a platform for hosting wiki pages with social media features on various topics such as video games, movies, books, and TV series.[3] The company also owns several entertainment outlets such as GameSpot and TV Guide, multimedia databases such as GameFAQs, Metacritic and ComicVine, as well as online retailers such as Fanatical.
The privately held for-profit Delaware company was founded in October 2004 by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and Angela Beesley Starling.[4] Fandom was acquired in 2018 by TPG Inc. and Jon Miller through Integrated Media Co.[5]
Fandom uses MediaWiki, the same open-source wiki software used by Wikipedia. Unlike the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit organization that hosts Wikipedia, Fandom, Inc. operates as a for-profit company and derives its income from advertising and sold content, publishing most user-provided text under copyleft licenses.[6] The company also runs the associated Fandom editorial project, offering pop-culture and gaming news.[7] Fandom wikis are hosted under the domain fandom.com, which has become one of the top 50 most visited websites in the world, rapidly rising in popularity beginning in the early 2020s. It ranks as the 50th as of October 2023, with 25.79% of its traffic coming from the United States, followed by Russia with 7.76%, according to Similarweb.[8]
Fandom was launched on October 18, 2004, at 23:50:49 (UTC) under the name Wikicities (which invited comparisons to Yahoo's GeoCities),[9][failed verification] by Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, and Angela Beesley Starling—respectively chairman emeritus and advisory board member of the Wikimedia Foundation. Wales' original idea was to use his Wikipedia idea for a place where people from the same city or other geographical place could come together.[10]
The project's name was changed to Wikia on March 27, 2006.[11] In the month before the move, Wikia announced a US$4 million venture capital investment from Bessemer Venture Partners and First Round Capital.[12] Nine months later, Amazon.com invested $10 million in Series B funding.[13] By September 2006, Wikia had approximately 1,500 wikis in 48 languages.[14] Over time, Wikia has incorporated formerly independent fan wikis such as LyricWiki, Nukapedia, Uncyclopedia, and WoWWiki.[15] Gil Penchina described Wikia early on as ""the rest of the library and magazine rack"" to Wikipedia's encyclopedia.[16] The material has also been described as informal, and often bordering on entertainment, allowing the importing of maps, YouTube videos, and other non-traditional wiki material.[17]
By 2010, wikis could be created in 188 different languages.[6] In October 2011, Craig Palmer, the former CEO of Gracenote, replaced Penchina as CEO.[18] In February 2012, co-founder Beesley Starling left Wikia to launch a startup called ChalkDrop.com.[19] At the end of November 2012, Wikia raised $10.8 million in Series C funding from Institutional Venture Partners and previous investors Bessemer Ventures Partners and Amazon.com.[20] Another $15 million was raised in August 2014 for Series D funding, with investors Digital Garage, Amazon, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Institutional Venture Partners. The total raised at this point was $39.8 million.[21][22]
On March 4, 2015, Wikia appointed Walker Jacobs, former executive vice-president of Turner Broadcasting System, to the new position of chief operating officer.[23] In December 2015, Wikia launched the Fan Contributor Program.
On January 25, 2016, Wikia launched a new entertainment news site named Fandom.[24] On October 4, Wikia itself was rebranded as ""Fandom powered by Wikia"", to better associate itself with the Fandom website. The parent company Wikia, Inc. remained under its then-current name until 2019, and the homepage of Wikia was moved to wikia.com/fandom and later to fandom.com.[2] In December, Wikia appointed Dorth Raphaely, former general manager of Bleacher Report, as chief content officer.[25]
On May 18, 2017, Fandom updated their branding with a refreshed logo, all-uppercase lettering, and a flat design instead of the previous green-blue gradients.[citation needed]
In February 2018, former AOL CEO Jon Miller, backed by private equity firm TPG Capital, acquired Fandom.[26] Miller was named co-chairman of Wikia, Inc., alongside Jimmy Wales,[27] and TPG Capital director Andrew Doyle assumed the role of interim CEO.[28] In July, Fandom purchased Screen Junkies from Defy Media,[29] and in December of that year, they had acquired Curse Media which included wiki farm Gamepedia and websites part of the Curse Network such as D&D Beyond, Futhead, Muthead, and StrawPoll.me.[30]
In February 2019, former StubHub CEO Perkins Miller took over as CEO,[28] and Wikia fully changed its domain name to fandom.com.[31] Various wikis had been tested with the new domain during 2018, with some wikis that focused on ""more serious topics"" having their domains changed to wikia.org instead.[32] In June, Fandom began an effort to rewrite its core platform, which was written based on MediaWiki version 1.19, to base it on a newer version of the software.[33] On March 11, 2020, Fandom released the Unified Community Platform (UCP), based on MediaWiki 1.33,[34] for newly created wikis.[35]
In 2020, Fandom sold Curse Network properties to Magic Find which includes communities and news websites.[36] In November, Fandom began to migrate Gamepedia wikis to a fandom.com domain as part of their search engine optimization strategy, with migrations continuing into 2021.[37][38]
In February 2021, Fandom acquired Focus Multimedia, the retailer behind Fanatical, an e-commerce platform that sells digital games, ebooks and other products related to gaming.[39] In late March, Fandom updated its terms of use policy to prohibit deadnaming transgender individuals across their websites.[40][41] This policy was in response to a referendum on the Star Wars wiki Wookieepedia to ban deadnaming, which triggered a debate around an article about the non-binary artist Robin Pronovost.[42] In response to the deadnaming controversy, Fandom also introduced new LGBT guidelines across its websites in late June 2021 which include links to queer-inclusive and trans support resources.[43]
In June 2021, Fandom began to roll out FandomDesktop, a redesigned theme for desktop devices,[44] with plans to retire its legacy Oasis and Hydra skins once the rollout was complete.[45] Two months later on August 3, Fandom rolled out a new look, new colors, new logo, and introduced a new tagline, ""For the love of fans.""[46]  In late November/early December, all remaining wikis under the wikia.org domain migrated to the fandom.com domain.[47]
On April 13, 2022, Hasbro announced that it would acquire D&D Beyond from Fandom.[48][49] Fandom shut down StrawPoll.me in August.[50] On October 3, Fandom acquired GameSpot, Metacritic, TV Guide, GameFAQs, Giant Bomb, Cord Cutters News, and Comic Vine from Red Ventures.[51]
In early 2023, Fandom began laying off some of the team responsible for GameSpot, Metacritic and Giant Bomb.[52][53][54] In January 2024, the company would begin another round of layoffs for part of GameSpot's editorial team.[55] Later in October 2024, it was reported that Fandom had laid off approximately 11% of their staff,[56][57] including some of the team behind GameSpot UK and Honest Trailers as well as Fandom staff in charge of sales and management, this was prompted by the company's failure to hit revenue goals in 2024.[58]
In February 2025, Fandom launched a new product called ""FanDNA Helix"", an AI model trained on all the pages hosted on the site as well as users' social media posts in order to allow advertisers to serve ads to readers based on their interests and consumption habits on the site.[59] In May 2025, Fandom later sold Giant Bomb to the site's staff.[60]
In July 2025, Fandom announced that it was going to translate entire wikis using generative AI for non-English speakers.[61] In October 2025, Perkins Miller resigned as CEO of Fandom. An article published by The Verge stated that the company was struggling to meet revenue targets, leading to a massive restructuring and the layoff of a large percentage of Fandom's staff. The newspaper also clarified that although the IP-focused wikis hosted by the platform are popular, the ads and interface are quite invasive and cause the page to become unstable and ""nearly unusable"" when loading on certain devices.[62]
The main purpose of articles in a Fandom community is to cover information and discussion on a particular topic in a much greater and more comprehensive detail level than what can be found in Wikipedia articles.[63]
Other examples of content that is generally considered beyond the scope of Wikipedia articles include Fandom information about video games and related video game topics, detailed instructions, gameplay details, plot details, and so forth. Gameplay concepts can also have their own articles. Fandom also allows wikis to have a point of view, rather than the neutral POV that is required by Wikipedia (although NPOV is a local policy on many Fandom communities).[64][65]
The image policies of Fandom communities tend to be more lenient than those of Wikimedia Foundation projects, allowing articles with much more illustration. Fandom requires all user text content to be published under a free license;[66] most use the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, although a few wikis use a license with a noncommercial clause (for instance Memory Alpha, Uncyclopedia and others[67]) and some use the GNU Free Documentation License.[d][68] Fandom's terms of use forbid hate speech, libel, pornography, or copyright infringement. Other material is allowed, as long as the added material does not duplicate existing wikis.[69]
Wikis are also not owned by their founders, nor does the founder's opinion carry more weight in disagreements than any other user's opinion. Consensus and cooperation are the primary means for organizing a community on Fandom.[69] However, Fandom may make decisions affecting the community even if there is no consensus at all.[70]
As of May 2023,[update] Fandom uses a heavily modified version[71] of the MediaWiki software, based on the version 1.39 of MediaWiki.[72] It has several custom extensions installed to add social features like blogs, chat, badges, forums, and multimedia,[73] but also remove features like advanced user options[74][75] or skins. The personal choice[76] of using the Monobook skin instead of the default custom skin was removed on May 25, 2018, alluding to GDPR compliance.[77]
In August 2016, Fandom announced it would switch to a service-oriented architecture.[78] It removed many custom extensions and functionality for specific wikis, and has created certain replacement features to fill those needs.[79]
In 2016, Wikia launched Fandom, an online entertainment media website. The program utilizes volunteer contributors called ""Fandom Contributors""[80] to produce articles, working alongside an editorial team employed by Wikia. In contrast to the blogging feature of individual wiki communities, Fandom focuses on pop culture and fan topics such as video games, movies, and television shows. The project features fan opinions, interviews with property creators, reviews, and how-to guides. Fandom also includes videos and specific news coverage sponsored or paid for by a property creator to promote their property.
In the same year, it was also announced that the entire Wikia platform would be rebranded under the Fandom name on October 4, 2016.[2] A leak from Fandom's Community Council was posted to Reddit's /r/Wikia subreddit in August 2018, confirming that Fandom would be migrating all wikis from the wikia.com domain, to fandom.com in early 2019, as part of a push for greater adoption of Fandom's wiki-specific applications on both iOS and Android's app ecosystems. The post was later deleted.[81]
Fandom has created several official partnerships to create wikis, vetted by the corporation as being the ""official"" encyclopedia or wiki of a property. In 2012, Fandom partnered with Sony Online Entertainment to create the first ""Wikia Official Community"" for PlanetSide 2, with the game's wiki slated to receive exclusive content and support.[82][83] In 2014, Fandom partnered with Roddenberry Enterprises to create the Trek Initiative, a Fandom hosted wiki community site that features video interviews, promotions, and other material about Star Trek to celebrate its 50th anniversary.[84] Fandom made similar partnerships with 2K Games during the launch of Civilization: Beyond Earth[85] and Warner Bros Interactive for Shadow of Mordor.[86] Fandom also has partnerships with Lionsgate Media to promote Starz and Film franchises through wiki content, fandom articles, and advertisements.[citation needed]
In 2021 the United States Navy hired Fandom to manage and promote esports tournaments and streams on Twitch.[87]
With Fandom's acquisition of Curse Media, the Curse Entertainment YouTube channel was renamed to Fandom Games. Fandom Games publishes Honest Game Trailers, which was previously published on the Smosh Games YouTube channel until Screen Junkies was acquired by Fandom.[88]
OpenServing was a short-lived Web publishing project owned by Fandom, founded on December 12, 2006,[89][90] and abandoned, unannounced, in January 2008.[91] Like Fandom, OpenServing was to offer free wiki hosting, but it would differ in that each wiki's founder would retain any revenue gained from advertising on the site.[89][92][93] OpenServing used a modified version of the Wikimedia Foundation's MediaWiki software created by ArmchairGM, but was intended to branch out to other open source packages.[89][94]
According to Fandom co-founder and chairman Jimmy Wales, the OpenServing site received several thousand applications in January 2007.[95] However, after a year, no sites had been launched under the OpenServing banner.[91]
ArmchairGM was a sports forum and wiki site created by Aaron Wright, Dan Lewis, Robert Lefkowitz, and developer David Pean. Launched in early 2006, the site was initially US-based but sought to improve its links to sports associated with Britain over its first year. Its MediaWiki-based software included a Digg-style article-voting mechanism, blog-like comment forms with ""thumbs up/down"" user feedback, and the ability to write multiple types of posts (news, opinions, or ""locker room"" discussion entries).[citation needed]
In late 2006, the site was bought by Fandom for $2 million.[96] After the purchase was made, the former owners applied ArmchairGM's architecture to other Fandom sites.[97] However, Wikia had ""dropped support"" for the custom software innovations by ArmchairGM by January 2010. From September 2010 to February 2011, Fandom absorbed ArmchairGM's encyclopedia articles and blanked all of its old blog entries, effectively discontinuing ArmchairGM in its original form.[citation needed]
The software powering ArmchairGM was incrementally open-sourced starting in February 2008 with the public release of the SocialProfile MediaWiki extension.[98] This process was complete by August 2011, when the original ArmchairGM codebase (internally codenamed wikia-ny[99]) was released in full. Since 2008 the ArmchairGM innovations, nicknamed ""social tools"", have been developed by volunteer developers of the MediaWiki community and they are available under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later, which is a free and open-source software license. The source code is hosted on the Wikimedia Foundation's web servers and mirrored to the popular source code hosting platform GitHub.[100][101]
Wikia, Inc. initially proposed creating a copyleft search engine; the software (but not the site) was named ""Wikiasari"" by a November 2004 naming contest.[e] The proposal became inactive in 2005.[citation needed] The ""public alpha"" of the Wikia Search web search engine was launched on January 7, 2008,[citation needed] from the USSHC underground data center.[103] This roll-out version of the search interface was roundly panned by reviewers in technology media.[104]
The project was ended in March 2009.[105] Late in 2009, a new search engine was established to index and display results from all sites hosted on Fandom.[citation needed]
In January 2009, the company created a question and answer website named ""Wikianswers"" (not to be confused with the preexisting WikiAnswers).[106] In March 2010, Fandom re-launched ""Answers from Wikia"", where users could create topic-specialized knowledge market wikis based upon Fandom's own Wikianswers subdomain.[107]
 In the 2000s, Fandom, then called Wikia, was accused of unduly profiting from a perceived association with Wikipedia.[108][109] Although Fandom has been referred to in the media as ""the commercial counterpart to the non-profit Wikipedia"",[110][111] Wikimedia[112] and Fandom staff[113] call this description inaccurate.
In 2006, the Wikimedia Foundation shared hosting and bandwidth costs with Wikia, and received some donated office space from Wikia during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006. At the end of the fiscal year 2007, Wikia owed the foundation $6,000. In June 2007, two members of the foundation's board of directors also served as employees, officers, or directors of Wikia.[114] In January 2009, Wikia subleased two conference rooms to the Wikimedia Foundation for the Wikipedia Usability Initiative.[115] According to a 2009 email by Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation:
We obtained about a dozen bids... We used averaging as a way to arrive at a fair market rate to neither advantage nor disadvantage Wikia when suggesting a rate. The averaging also resulted in a rate that was roughly equivalent to the most comparable space in the running.[116]Fandom communities have complained of inappropriate advertisements, resource-intensive advertisements, or advertising in the body text area. Users have also complained that the advertisements are so resource-intensive and hindering, that they have no choice but to use an ad-blocker to continue using the website.[117] The massive amount of ads alters the performance of the website, especially on mobile where the insertion of autoplay videos causes the page to refresh.[118] In a report published by Emarketer in mid-2025 about the marketshare of Fandom noted the presence of malvertising within the platform, where there were occasions when ads embedded in wiki pages could redirect to suspicious sites.[119]
The excessive monetization model of user-generated content has been criticized by several newspaper outlets, such as the British newspaper The Guardian, who argue that editors do not receive any benefits or rights in return for the content they contribute to the platform.[120] Likewise, the Journal of Student Research has called Fandom exploitative and argued that its practices have formed an informational monopoly, making it harder for other sites to compete with them.[121] Other concerns were also raised about Fandom's extensive commercialization of user-generated content, where the use of a for-profit model has undermined the quality of part of its database as well as trust in online spaces.[122]
In August 2024, the publishing company Adalytics released a report indicating the presence of major brand advertisements in wiki articles containing obscene material including articles containing racial slurs towards Black people and white supremacist material, as well as content promoting sexual assault[123] on several small wikis hosted by Fandom.[124][125] The AI system used by Fandom supplemented by DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science was criticized for displaying ads on malicious content.[126][127]
Fandom can alter user-generated content by incorporating obstructive elements without prior consultation with users, such as adding popups to customize ads, promoting unrelated articles, which may have questionable topics, and incorporation of unrelated quizzes to boost engagement.[128] In addition, Fandom may arbitrarily remove content without prior consultation with the editors involved.[129]
In 2017, Fandom started to incorporate autoplaying to different wikis about video game franchises such as Runescape[130] and Fallout,[131] this feature was implemented without prior consultation of the editors responsible for the maintenance of the wikis, these videos were criticized for undermining the quality standards of the site.[132]
In 2021, Fandom began removing and censoring adult material, including the deletion of entire wikis dedicated to documenting pieces of media with adult content. These measures were criticized by users as well as editors following the implementation of these guidelines without prior notice from the company.[133][134]
In 2022, Fandom merged several wikis specializing in documenting sexuality and gender, including the deletion of several pages without prior consultation by users. These actions were criticized after the incorporation of material offensive to intersex identities and changes in editorial direction to make it more “corporate friendly”.[135] Additionally, critics who voiced their disapproval after the merge of the LGBTQIA wikis were blocked on both social media as well as on the Fandom wiki following the controversy.[135] In the same year, the editorial team behind the Zelda Wiki clarified that one of the reasons they decided to move to an independent host was due to concerns about “corporate consolidation” and how their experience at Fandom had limited some of their editorial independence. In addition, the team of editors urged other communities to migrate some of their content and the creation of writers' union.[136]
In 2023, Fandom introduced AI Generated Content in the form of “Quick Answers” to different wikis, such content consisted of grammatical mistakes as well as factual errors[137][138] and was subsequently removed after public backlash by editors and users. In an article published by Game Developer, the editorial team behind the Hollow Knight Wiki explained that one of the reasons they chose to migrate their content was due to Fandom's attempts to introduce generative AI into their articles, causing them to contain misinformation with the aim of increasing revenue, as well as concerns that the company is opting to use Generative AI to replace human writers and artists.[139]
In May 2025, Fandom introduced “brand safety” guidelines to GiantBomb, such measures were criticized and mocked by the website staff in a podcast, which would later be removed by Fandom.[140][141]
Fandom has been subject to several lawsuits in the State of California following data collection in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act, where the website shared user information without prior consent such as IP addresses[142][143][144] and viewing habits[145][146] to third party companies such as Meta. Lawsuits regarding privacy violations against Fandom began in 2022 following reports that the company was selling sensitive information to external platforms.[145] Later in 2023, a federal judge in California clarified that Fandom cannot evade lawsuits regarding data sharing filed by consumers.[147]
The company had previously been sued in several district courts in California for copyright infringement regarding the unauthorized use of images created from professional photographers on its website, including lawsuits by photographer Linda Matlow for the use of material from her professional catalog[148] and film director Michael Grecco for the use of promotional imagery taken for The X-Files.[149][150]
In June 2023, McDonald's paid Fandom an undisclosed amount to temporarily replace the McDonald's Wiki's main page and exhaustive article on Grimace with an advertisement promoting the Grimace Shake and the character's 52nd anniversary. The article's primary contributor, Nathan Steinmetz, complained that the decision undermined his research and efforts and considered Fandom to have set a ""really bad precedent"" of IP holders' ability to suppress user-generated content with press releases.[151][152][153]
A number of wikis have migrated away from Fandom, citing issues such as intrusive advertising and branding, a non-user-friendly site design, a lack of customizability and company cross-promotion which is often irrelevant to wiki content.[130][154] One of the earliest examples was the Transformers Wiki, which migrated in 2008 due to disagreements with Fandom—then Wikia—staff regarding intrusive advertising.[155] Other communities, such as the Zelda Wiki and Minecraft Wiki, have named the increasing ""corporate consolidation"" of wikis, alleged censorship, Fandom's ""degraded"" functionality and the Grimace controversy among their reasons for migrating.[154][156][157] Covering the Minecraft Wiki's departure for PC Gamer, Rich Stanton stated that most of the migrations began after the 2018 acquisition and Gamepedia's move to Fandom. He noted that the Minecraft Wiki would have to compete with Fandom's better search engine optimization (SEO) and would have a struggle to establish a wider audience after moving.[154] In 2023, Fandom CEO Perkins Miller told The Verge that he takes wiki migration ""very seriously"".[158]
Some of the more high-profile wikis which have migrated from Fandom include the RuneScape wiki in 2018,[130] the Zelda and Terraria wikis in 2022,[156][157][159] the Minecraft, Fallout and Hollow Knight wikis in 2023,[154][128][160] the South Park, Dead by Daylight and League of Legends wikis in 2024,[161] and the Warframe, Vampire Survivors,[162] Undertale/Deltarune, Nichijou and Balatro wikis[additional citation(s) needed] in 2025. Additionally, in that same year, the editorial team behind the Ys, Trails, Xanadu and Gagharv wikis decided to migrate their content en masse to independent platforms in order to create a more comprehensive repository of games developed by Nihon Falcom, citing issues such as intrusive advertisements on the platform.[163] Some wikis have received support from the creators of their topic areas during migration.[130][159][161][162]
There is no easy way for individual communities to switch to conventional paid hosting, as Fandom usually owns the relevant domain names. When a community leaves Fandom for new hosting, Fandom typically continues to operate the abandoned (""forked"") wiki using its original name and content for advertising revenue as long as editing and viewership remains. This can adversely affect the new wiki's search rankings,[155] potentially also resulting in outdated or incorrect information being present and viewed more often than the information on the new wiki. Fandom allows only a message directing viewers to a discussion about whether to fork for as long as the discussion is active before the message is removed, and any administrators involved in the new wiki have their rights on the Fandom wiki removed.
The overall parent company, Fandom, Inc., is headquartered at the Hallidie Building on 130 Sutter Street[164] in San Francisco, California.[165] The company was incorporated in Florida in December 2004 and re-incorporated in Delaware as Wikia, Inc. on January 10, 2006.[166]
Fandom has technical staff in the US, but also has an office in Poznań, Poland, where the primary engineering functions are performed.[14]
Fandom derives income from advertising. The company initially used Google AdSense[167] but moved on to Federated Media before bringing ad management in-house.[168] Alongside Fandom's in-house advertising, they continue to use AdSense as well as Amazon Ads and several other third-party advertising services. Fandom also gains income from various partnerships oriented around various sweepstake sponsorships on related wikis.
Fandom has several other offices.[169] International operations are based in Germany, and Asian operations and sales are conducted in Tokyo. Other sales offices are located in Chicago, Latin America, Los Angeles (marketing programming and content), New York City, and London.[170]
"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub,Wikipedia:Stub,"A stub is an article which is deemed too short and incomplete to provide in-depth encyclopedic coverage of a subject. As of 2025, almost half of Wikipedia's articles could be considered stubs. 
This page provides a general guide for dealing with stubs: the first section, Basic information, contains information that is recommended for most users; and the second section, Creating stub types, contains more specialized material. 
Existing stub categories can be found at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Stub types, as maintained by the 
WikiProject Stub improvement collaborative.
A stub is an article that lacks the breadth of coverage expected from an encyclopedia but still provides some useful information and is capable of expansion. Non-article pages, such as disambiguation pages, lists, categories, templates, talk pages, and redirects, are not regarded as stubs.
If a stub has little verifiable information, or if its subject has no apparent notability, it may be deleted or be merged into another relevant article.
Sizable articles are usually not considered stubs, even if they have significant problems or are noticeably incomplete. With these larger articles, a cleanup template is usually added instead of a stub template.
Over the years, different editors have followed different rules of thumb to help them decide when an article is likely to be a stub. Editors may decide that an article with more than ten sentences is too big to be a stub, or that the threshold for another article may be 250 words. Others follow the Did you know? standard of 1,500 characters in the main text, which is usually around 300 words. 
There is no set size at which an article stops being a stub. While very short articles are very likely to be stubs, there are some subjects about which very little can be written. Conversely, there are subjects about which a lot could be written, and their articles may still be stubs even if they are a few paragraphs long. As such, it is impossible to state whether an article is a stub based solely on its length, and any decision on the article has to come down to an editor's best judgment (the user essay on the Croughton-London rule may be of use when trying to judge whether an article is a stub). Similarly, stub status usually depends on the length of prose text alone; lists, templates, images, and other such peripheral parts of an article are usually not considered when judging whether an article is a stub.
That said, AutoWikiBrowser is frequently set to automatically remove stub tags from any article with more than 500 words.  This threshold was chosen because it is very unlikely that any article containing more than 500 words is correctly classified as a stub.
A stub should contain enough information for other editors to expand upon it. The key is to provide adequate context—articles with little or no context usually end up being speedily deleted. Your initial research may be done either through books or reliable websites. You may also contribute knowledge acquired from other sources, but it is useful to conduct some research beforehand to ensure that your facts are accurate and unbiased. Use your own words: directly copying other sources without giving them credit is plagiarism, and may in some cases be a violation of copyright.
Begin by defining or describing your topic. Avoid fallacies of definition. Write clearly and informatively. State what a person is famous for, where a place is located and what it is known for, or the basic details of an event and when it happened.  As of 2024, most stubs contain two to seven sentences (50–150 words).
Next, try to expand upon this basic definition. Internally link relevant words, so that users unfamiliar with the subject can understand what you have written. Avoid linking words needlessly; instead, consider which words may require further definition for a casual reader to understand the article.  Most stubs link out to 5–20 other Wikipedia articles, often averaging about two links per sentence.
Lastly, a critical step: add sources for the information you have put into the stub; see citing sources for information on how to do so in Wikipedia.  Most stub articles have one to three inline citations; some also list sources at the end of the page, as general references.

After writing a short article, or finding an unmarked stub, you should insert a stub template. Choose from among the templates listed at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Stub types, or if you are unsure what template to use, just use a generic {{stub}}, which others can sort later. Stubs should never be manually added to stub categories—always use a template.
Per the Manual of Style, the stub template is placed at the end of the article, after the External links section, any navigation templates, and the category tags, so that the stub category will appear after all article content. Until December 2024, it was the standard to leave two blank lines between the first stub template on a page and whatever preceded it (see Wikipedia talk:Stub#Replace double-blank-line method with CSS). This is now unnecessary, and the extra line should be removed when encountered. As with all templates, stub templates are added by simply placing the name of the template in the text between double pairs of curly brackets (e.g., {{Wikipedia-stub}}). Stub templates are transcluded, not substituted.
Stub templates have two parts: a short message noting the stub's topic and encouraging editors to expand it, and a category link, which places the article in a stub category alongside other stubs on the same topic. For example, inclusion of the {{Art-historian-stub}} template adds the article to the Category:Art historian stubs category; an explicit [[Category:Art historian stubs]] link is not needed and should be removed if present.
The naming for stub templates is usually topic-stub; a list of these templates may be found here. You need not learn all the templates—even simply adding {{stub}} helps (see this essay for more information). The more accurately an article is tagged, however, the less work it is for other sorters later, and the more useful it is for editors looking for articles to expand.
If a more specific stub template than is currently on an article exists and completely covers the subject of the article, remove the more general template and replace it with the more specific type (for example, an article on Morocco may be stubbed with {{Africa-stub}}. If it is solely about Morocco, remove the template and replace it with {{Morocco-stub}} – don't simply add {{Morocco-stub}} and leave {{Africa-stub}} in place). One specific template can often replace multiple more general types (for example, {{UK-sport-bio-stub}} can replace both {{UK-bio-stub}} and {{sport-bio-stub}}).
If an article overlaps several stub categories, more than one template may be used, but it is strongly recommended that only those relating to the subject's main notability be used. A limit of three or, if really necessary, four stub templates is advised.
Stub-related activities are centralised at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting (shortcut Wikipedia:WSS). This project should be your main reference for stub information, and is where new stub types should be proposed for discussion prior to creation.
Once a stub has been properly expanded and becomes a larger article, any editor may remove its stub template. No administrator action or formal permission is needed. Stub templates are usually located at the bottom of the page, and usually have a name like {{something-stub}} if you are using the classic wikitext editor rather than VisualEditor.
Many articles still marked as stubs have in fact been expanded beyond what is regarded as stub size. If an article is too large to be considered a stub but still needs expansion, the stub template may be removed and appropriate {{expand section}} templates may be added (no article should contain both a stub template and an expand template).
When removing stub templates, users should also visit the talk page and update the WikiProject classifications as necessary.
Be bold in removing stub tags that are clearly no longer applicable.
These categories can be used with AutoWikiBrowser (AWB) to  make bulk changes to stub types, or the sub-program within AWB called DataBase Scanner can be used to find articles by number of characters or words to locate potential stubs needing categorization or other tagging and/or expansion. This stand-alone application requires the operator be approved and the installation of the program on a personal computer (Linux, Mac, or PC). An alternate process using the web-based tool PetScan (no installation required) can also be used to locate articles by minimum or maximum size, the intersection of stub categories along with another category of interest, templates on the page, date of last edit, and namespace.
Please propose new stub types at WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals so that they may be discussed before creating them.
In general, a stub type consists of a stub template and a dedicated stub category, although ""upmerged"" templates are also occasionally created which feed into more general stub categories.
If you identify a group of stub articles that do not fit an existing stub type, or if an existing stub category is growing very large, you can propose the creation of a new stub type which is debated at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals.
An example of a stub template is {{Website-stub}}, which produces:
This website-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.The stub category, Category:Website stubs, lists all articles containing the {{Website-stub}} template.
Several guidelines are used to decide whether a new stub type is useful. These include the following:
If you think you have satisfied these guidelines, it is highly recommended that you propose the new stub type at stub type proposals page. This allows for debate on matters relating to the stub type that may not have occurred to the proposer, and also allows for objections if the split does not satisfy stub guidelines. If there are no objections within five days, you may create the new stub type.
After the creation of a new stub type has been discussed at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals and agreed upon, a template can be created. The name of this should follow the stub type naming conventions, and will usually be decided during the discussion process.
All stub templates should link to a stub category. This may be a category specific to the topic of the template, or the template might be ""upmerged"" to one or more less specific categories – for example, a template for Andorran history might link to a stub category for European history and a general Andorran stub category. This is often thought to be desirable when a stub type is proposed in anticipation of future use, but is not currently over the size threshold; or where an existing stub type has a finite number of well-defined subdivisions, with some numerically viable as subtypes, and others not. 
As stub templates can sort articles into more general categories, the bar for the creation of a stub template is not as high as the bar for the creation of a dedicated stub category; a template should still be used on more than just one or two pages, but does not necessarily require 60. In fact, the creation of a stub template may be a helpful tracking tool for determining whether the topic is approaching the 60-article minimum to justify a category, as the template's ""what links here"" can be used to count how many articles are using the template.
Adding a small image to the stub template (the ""stub icon"") is permitted, so long as the image is public domain or has a free license—fair use images must not be used in templates. Stub icons should be small, preferably no more than about 40px in size.
The standard code for stub templates is found at: {{asbox}}. This template can be used (without substitution).
The name of the stub category should also have been decided during the proposal process and will also follow the naming guidelines.
The text of a stub category should contain a definition of what type of stubs are contained in it and an indication of what template is used to add stubs to it. The {{WPSS-cat}} template should also be placed on the category, to indicate that it has been created after debate at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals. The new stub category should also be added to the Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Stub types list.
The new stub category should be correctly added into other categories. These should include at least three specific categories:
Thus, for example, Category:France stubs, should be in an equivalent permcat (Category:France), parent stub category (Category:Europe stubs), and Category:Stub categories.
The creation of stub categories can be partially automated by using {{Stub category}} as follows:
{{Stub category|article=[[A]]|newstub=B|category=C}}
In the example given above, the formatting would look like this:
{{Stub category|article=[[France]]|newstub=France-stub|category=France}}
which would produce this:
This syntax also automatically adds the new category to Category:Stub categories, though parent stub categories and {{WPSS-cat}} still need to be added manually. It also automatically pipes the stub category with ""Σ"", so that appears at the end of the list of subcategories in non-stub category C. This effectively moves it away from navigation categories to place it alongside other editing- and cleanup-related categories.
If you have some doubts or comments regarding any part of the process, do not hesitate to address them or ask for assistance at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Stub sorting.
On occasion, an article may have significant problems that create opportunities to remove most of its content. This may be done in response to an article that is heavily biased, either for or against its subject; in response to an article that has some verifiable material but is otherwise full of original research, self-published, or primary sources; in response to a VRT complaint; or a variety of other reasons.
If enough content is removed that all that remains is a stub, a stub template should be added to the article, if it does not already have one.
When a new WikiProject commences, one of the first things its creators often do is decide whether or not a specific stub type should be created for it. Often there is no real problem, as WikiProject topics frequently coincide with subjects of specific stub types. On other occasions, there will be no specific stub type, and thus a new type should be proposed.
Occasionally, a WikiProject will seek to have a stub category which is too small, or a stub type which runs contrary to the way stubs are normally split. This can create conflict between that project and WikiProject Stub sorting, or, more importantly, between that one stub type and one or more other stub types. Even where there is an existing stub type, there may be conflict, as often the definition of a topic as used for stub sorting may not be identical to that used by its specific WikiProject. It should be remembered in cases like this that, while a specific WikiProject may be looking for a solution for its concerns, WikiProject Stub sorting is attempting to make a coherent and cohesive system that works for all editors. The system needs to be as compatible as possible with the needs of all WikiProjects, and also with the needs of casual editors, and others who are participants in any WikiProject.
Assessment templates are a way around this problem, and more often than not a far more useful tool for WikiProjects. Assessment templates have several distinct advantages over stub types for WikiProjects. The templates are placed on article talk pages, where they are less likely to be seen as controversial (the placing of stub templates on controversial articles has frequently been a source of edit warring). They allow all articles within a topic area to be assessed and catalogued by a related project—not just stub articles. They allow an indication to be made of exactly what work needs to be done on an article. They also allow workgroups that are subgroups of WikiProjects to have their own specific templates that are better suited to their tasks.

Collins began acting at the age of two in the BBC series Growing Pains. She appeared in two episodes of the teen drama series 90210, including the first season's finale. Later that year, she had her breakthrough starring in the film The Blind Side as Collins Tuohy, the daughter of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock's character).[12] It was a commercial success,[13][14] grossing over $250 million at and emerging as the highest-grossing sports drama of all time.[15]
In 2011, she played the warrior priest's daughter Lucy in the thriller Priest,[16] opposite Paul Bettany.[17][18] Although it was a critical and commercial failure, she was praised for her performance, and MTV Networks' NextMovie.com named her one of the Breakout Stars to Watch for in 2011.[19] She co-starred in the 2011 action film Abduction with Taylor Lautner.[20]
In 2012, Collins played Snow White in Mirror Mirror, an adaptation of the fairytale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Robbie Collin from the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph wrote of her: ""She has an adorable, sensational, almost perfect face for cinema; think Audrey Hepburn with the eyebrows of Liam Gallagher. Her smile is the platonic ideal of cheeky.""[21] Collins made her singing debut in the film, performing an English rewritten cover of ""I Believe (in Love)"". Also in 2012, she portrayed Samantha in Stuck in Love.[22]
Collins was initially cast as the lead in the 2013 remake of Evil Dead, but dropped out due to a scheduling issue.[23][24] She played the title role as an earth-visiting alien in M83's music video ""Claudia Lewis"", released in August 2013.

When the film was released on Netflix there was some controversy about whether the film would be triggering for those with eating disorders.[34] This controversy was also influenced by another Netflix original show 13 Reasons Why after it was accused of glamorising suicide.[35][36] Despite the taboo topic of the film, Collins's depiction of Ellen was described as ""exemplary work from Lily Collins in the central role.""[37] Justin Chang of Los Angeles Times wrote that ""In a different film, Ellen's sharp tongue might have made her an insufferable fount of wisecracking negativity, but Collins' performance is subtler than that, and the script gives her ample opportunity to reveal the character's more complicated, vulnerable edges.""[38][39][40]
Collins was cast in the Netflix drama film Okja directed by Bong Joon-ho.[41] The film competed for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival and received a four-minute standing ovation after its premiere.[42][43] It was released on Netflix on 28 June 2017.[44] In 2017, it was revealed that Les Misérables would be adapted by Andrew Davies into a BBC mini series directed by Tom Shankland.[45] Collins starred as Fantine, a young woman in Paris who is abandoned by her wealthy lover, forcing her to look after their child, Cosette, on her own. Filming began in February 2018 in Belgium and Northern France.[46] Critics praised Collins's performance as Fantine; Alexandra Pollard of The Independent wrote that ""[Collins] plays the tragic Fantine with steeliness and grace,"" in a ""magnificent""[47] performance, while another critic stated that ""Lily Collins does not sing her anguished soul out when she is abandoned by her lover. So much so, she impressed me from the get-go with her emotionally rich performance.""[48]
In 2019, Collins co-starred with Zac Efron in the drama Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, directed by Joe Berlinger. She plays Elizabeth Kendall, Ted Bundy's long-time girlfriend, who struggles to accept that her boyfriend is a serial killer.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Brown_(actor),Rob Brown (actor),"
Robert Brown (born March 11, 1984) is an American actor. He is known for his roles in the films Finding Forrester (2000), Coach Carter (2005), Take the Lead (2006), and The Express: The Ernie Davis Story (2008), and for starring in the HBO series Treme (2010–13) and NBC series Blindspot (2015-2020).
Brown was born in Harlem, New York, on March 11, 1984,[1][2] the middle of three children.[3] Brown's mother works as a substance abuse counselor.[3] He was raised in Brooklyn. Brown attended Poly Prep Country Day School and Prep for Prep,[4] where he played on the school's football team as a wide receiver.[3][5] He graduated from Amherst College, where he balanced his education and acting career.[4] Prior to being cast in Finding Forrester, Brown's only acting experience was a school play during childhood.[3]
When he turned 16, Brown auditioned for Finding Forrester, expecting to be cast as an extra.[6] However, the film's director Gus Van Sant claimed Brown was the actor he was seeking to portray high school basketball player Jamal Wallace, and cast him in the role.[7] Brown made his acting debut in the 2000 film, opposite Sean Connery.[8] Brown received positive reviews in his first acting role. One critic believed Brown shone more than his veteran co-star.[9] A film reviewer stated Brown held his own ""remarkably well"" alongside Connery,[10] with a third opining the two actors had an ""appealing chemistry.""[11]
In 2005, he played the role of basketball player Kenyon Stone in the drama film Coach Carter, starring Samuel L. Jackson.[12] Reviewer A. O. Scott opined Brown had a ""strong"" showing in the movie.[13] The following year, he appeared as a high school student Jason ""Rock"" Rockwell in the dance film Take the Lead, starring Antonio Banderas and Alfre Woodard.[14] Brown portrayed football player Ernie Davis in The Express: The Ernie Davis Story (2008).[15]
Brown landed his first television role as jazz musician Delmond Lambreaux on drama series Treme in 2010.[16] He continued portraying the character until the show ended in 2013.[17] Brown was cast in the NBC drama Blindspot (2015−20) as FBI Special Agent Edgar Reade.[18] He appeared as Bobby in Don Jon (2013)[19] and played the role of Bryce in Criminal Activities (2015).[20] In 2022, Brown recurred as Maurice Ward in miniseries We Own This City.[21]
In 2013, CNN reported that actor Rob Brown had reached a “settlement in principle” in his racial profiling lawsuits against Macy’s and the City of New York, according to court documents and a statement from the retailer.
The lawsuits stemmed from an incident earlier that year in which Brown was arrested after allegedly purchasing a watch for his mother with a “fake” credit card at Macy’s in New York City. He was later released without charges when it was confirmed that the American Express card was his. Macy’s staff had reportedly become suspicious—possibly because of the cost of the watch, his age, or his ethnicity—but failed to verify the card’s validity or match it with his driver’s license.""[22]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Hosers,Yoga Hosers,"
Yoga Hosers is a 2016 American comedy horror film written and directed by Kevin Smith. It is a spin-off of Smith's 2014 horror film Tusk and it features Smith's daughter Harley Quinn Smith, Lily-Rose Depp and her father Johnny Depp reprising their roles with Justin Long, Haley Joel Osment, Genesis Rodriguez, Harley Morenstein, Ralph Garman, and Smith's wife Jennifer Schwalbach Smith appearing in new roles. New cast members include Lily-Rose Depp's mother Vanessa Paradis in addition to Austin Butler and Tyler Posey. The second film in Smith's True North trilogy, it had its world premiere on January 24 at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival before being released on September 2, 2016, by Invincible Pictures. The film was a commercial flop and was panned by critics, who viewed it as a low point in Smith's career.
Colleen Collette and Colleen McKenzie are two 15-year-old girls who spend their days studying yoga with their guru, Yogi Bayer, and working an after-school job at a Manitoba convenience store called Eh-2-Zed. They are also in a cover band called Glamthrax with their 35-year-old friend Ichabod on drums. The two are invited to a party by a popular senior, Hunter Calloway, who is the object of Colleen M's affections.
The next day at school, the girls' history teacher informs the class that the Nazi Party once had influence in Winnipeg. Led by the self-proclaimed ""Canadian Führer"" Adrien Arcand and his right-hand man, Andronicus Arcane, the Canadian Nazis were once a great force of terror. Arcand was later arrested by Federal authorities, but Andronicus Arcane was never found.
Colleen C's father Bob and his girlfriend Tabitha decide to take a spontaneous trip to Niagara Falls, leaving the girls to run the store on the night of Hunter's party. The Colleens invite Hunter and his friend Gordon Greenleaf to bring the party to the store so that they would not miss out. Colleen M escorts Hunter to the back room at his request, only to discover that Hunter and Gordon are actually Satanists who wish to sacrifice and dismember the Colleens. Before this can occur, an army of little monsters called Bratzis (one-foot-tall Nazis made from bratwurst) attack and kill Hunter and Gordon. Using their yoga skills, the Colleens fight and defeat the Bratzis, but are soon arrested for the murder of Hunter and Gordon.
Legendary man-hunter Guy LaPointe, who had an encounter with the Colleens once before, arrives at the police station to interrogate the girls. Having obtained some of his own evidence of the Bratzis, he believes the girls' testimony and wishes to help them prove their innocence. After sneaking them out of the station and taking them back to the Eh-2-Zed, LaPointe and the Colleens are knocked unconscious by the Bratzis. They are taken to an underground lair beneath the store where they find the Bratzis' master, Andronicus Arcane.
Arcane reveals to LaPointe and the Colleens that he once had dreams of becoming an artist. After having his work ridiculed by various critics, he decided to become a scientist for the Canadian Nazi movement. The Nazis hid him in the underground lair to create a clone army to conquer Canada and the United States. The clones, made from bratwurst and Arcane's DNA, needed to incubate for 100 years before they were fully grown, so Arcane cryogenically froze himself until the time when he and his clones could rise again. This process was interrupted when a power outage at the Eh-2-Zed 70 years later caused Arcane to thaw and the clones' incubation to stop, rendering them just one foot in height.
Learning that the Nazi Party had long since been defeated, Arcane began a new mission to kill all critics as revenge for those that poorly reviewed his early work. He reveals he has constructed a ten-foot-tall goaltender from body parts of the Bratzis' victims to carry out his murderous deeds. This ""Goalie Golem"" is controlled by the Bratzis who operate it from its insides. No longer wishing to follow Arcane's orders, the Golem kills him and then turns on the Colleens. The Colleens once again use their yoga skills to defeat the Golem and soon after, clear their names.
After being dubbed ""Hero Clerks"" by the media, the Colleens return to their normal lives and end the film with Glamthrax's cover of ""O Canada"", accompanied on guitar by Guy LaPointe.
Smith revealed before the release of Tusk that he had written a spin-off film called Yoga Hosers, which would feature the cast from Tusk.[3]
The title came from a remark Scott Mosier made during an early 2014 segment of SModcast, the podcast he cohosts with Smith. Smith brought up fanciful quotes attributed to Simon Metke, an Edmonton yoga instructor whose home had recently been raided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), who recovered an artwork stolen from the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in 2011 there. Mosier imagined the RCMP saying ""Open up, yoga hoser!"" as they knocked on the door. After it became a catchphrase among the podcast's listeners, Smith announced it would be the title of his next film. The character of Yogi Bayer in the film is also based on descriptions of Metke in the media.[4]
In August 2014, it was revealed Yoga Hosers would be an action-adventure, and the second in the True North trilogy.[5] The film includes the entire cast of Tusk, including Depp's daughter Lily-Rose and Smith's daughter Harley Quinn, starring in their reprised roles as clerks.[5] Tony Hale, Natasha Lyonne, Austin Butler, Adam Brody, Tyler Posey, and Jason Mewes also appear.[5] StarStream Entertainment helped finance and produce the film, while XYZ Films co-produced.[5] In September 2014, it was revealed Haley Joel Osment and Genesis Rodriguez had joined the cast as well,[6][7] and it was later revealed Kevin Smith would portray a bratzi.[8] Comic book writer Stan Lee had a cameo appearance, his second in a Smith film, after 1995's Mallrats.[9] Thomas Ashley put up 25% of the equity to create the film and was an executive producer.[10]
Smith announced on August 20, 2014, that filming had begun,[11] and on September 18, 2014, he stated on SModcast #308 that he had wrapped three quarters of the film, and would finish the last quarter once Depp is available.[12] Principal photography concluded in January 2015.[13]
The film had its world premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on January 24.[14][15] A tie-in comic book was also given out exclusively at the Sundance premiere.  Written by Kevin Smith and illustrated by Jeff Quigley, Yoga Hosers: When Colleens Collide tells the story of how the girls met and became friends.[16] Later in 2017, Dynamite Entertainment reprinted this special issue for release to comic stores.[17] In April 2016, Invincible Pictures acquired US distribution rights to the film, and initially planned a July 29, 2016, release.[18] The film was later pushed back to September 2.[19]
If you were to tell me a midnight movie was coming out that was a cross between Clueless, a second-rate Gremlins knock-off, the 1966 Batman, Strange Brew, and Clerks, I would have said, 'Wow, that sounds great!' If you were to tell me that the same film was written and directed by Smith, however, my response would change to, 'Wow, that sounds terrible!'
Yoga Hosers was panned by critics, who considered it a low point in Smith's film career. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 26%, based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 3.70/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Undisciplined, unfunny, and bereft of evident purpose, Yoga Hosers represents a particularly grating low point in Kevin Smith's once-promising career.""[21] On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 23 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating ""generally unfavorable reviews"".[22]

Justin Chang of Variety disliked the film, writing that Harley Quinn Smith and especially Lily-Rose Depp have sufficient spunk, spark and chemistry (and they're charming bopping through an end-credits cover of ""O Canada"") that you long to see them in a starring vehicle that doesn't look and feel like an on-screen underwear stain. Shot and edited with the sort of willful slovenliness that presumably fits the anything-goes grab-bag effect Smith was going for, Yoga Hosers looks as though it was probably pretty fun to make, though only the director's hardcore fans and SModcast listeners are likely to find that pleasure in any way infectious.[23] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter also gave the film a negative review, writing that ""the young leads seem to be having fun even if you aren't, but any acting careers they might go on to will not be the result of this film.""[24]
Korey Coleman of DoubleToasted.com expressed strong criticism for the film, stating that it was the worst movie he had seen in years.[25] He also felt Smith's privilege in obtaining funding for the film was an insult to aspiring filmmakers who struggle to even get a foot in the door of the industry.[25] He placed it at the #1 spot for the worst movie of 2016, tying with Fifty Shades of Black.[26]
In an extended review for The A.V. Club in 2017, Nathan Rabin summed up the film as a ""fiasco"", blaming ""self-indulgence"" and ""laziness"" leading to ""Smith combin[ing] what are clearly his two great loves in life: family and making terrible comedies. It's a beautiful thing when a man is able to fuse his personal and professional life this way. It's just a shame the result is borderline unwatchable.""[20]
Kevin Smith has said that his True North trilogy will conclude with a film titled Moose Jaws, which he describes as ""Jaws with a moose"".[27] Smith revealed that the Colleens will return for Moose Jaws.[28]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Parkinson,Michael Parkinson,"
Sir Michael Parkinson (28 March 1935 – 16 August 2023) was an English television presenter, broadcaster, journalist and author. He presented his television talk show Parkinson from 1971 to 1982 and from 1998 to 2007, as well as other talk shows and programmes both in the UK and abroad. He also worked in radio and was described by The Guardian as ""the great British talkshow host"".[1]
Michael Parkinson was born on 28 March 1935 in the village of Cudworth, in Barnsley. The son of a miner,[2] he was educated at Barnsley Grammar School after passing the eleven-plus and in 1951 passed two O-Levels: in art and English language. He was a club cricketer and both he and his opening partner at Barnsley Cricket Club, Dickie Bird, had trials for Yorkshire together with Geoffrey Boycott.[3] He once kept Boycott out of the Barnsley Cricket Club team by scoring a century and 50 in two successive matches.[1] A young Michael Parkinson World XI played at the Scarborough Festival between 1988 and 1990.[4]
Parkinson began his career as a journalist on local newspapers straight after leaving school. He worked as a features writer for the Manchester Guardian, working alongside Michael Frayn and later on the Daily Express in London.[1] In the course of his two years' National Service, which began in July 1955, he received a commission as an officer in the Royal Army Pay Corps, becoming the youngest captain in the British Army at the time.[5] He saw active service in Egypt in the Suez Crisis as a British Army press liaison officer.[6][7]
During the 1960s, Parkinson moved into television, working on current-affairs programmes for the BBC and Manchester-based Granada Television. He was one of the presenters on the five-times-a-week news show Twenty-Four Hours on BBC1 from March 1966[8] until January 1968.[9] From 1969 he presented Granada's Cinema, a late-night film review programme,[5] before in July 1971 presenting his BBC series Parkinson, which ran until April 1982 and from January 1998 until December 2007, leaving the BBC for ITV1 midway through the second run, which concluded after 31 series. By his own reckoning, he had interviewed 2,000 of the world's celebrities.[10] Parkinson was one of the original ""Famous Five"" line-up of TV-am's Good Morning, Britain in 1983, with Angela Rippon, Anna Ford, David Frost and Robert Kee.[11] Parkinson presented the weekend edition of the programme until February 1984.[12]
He also took over as host of Thames Television's Give Us a Clue from Michael Aspel from 1984,[13] while in 1985, he stood in for Barry Norman as presenter of Film 85.[14]
In 1987 and 1988, Parkinson hosted fifteen episodes of Parkinson One to One for Yorkshire Television, a series of interview programmes which continued in the style of his BBC talk show but with each episode dedicated to a single celebrity guest.[15]
On Halloween 1992, Parkinson appeared as himself in the television drama Ghostwatch as the studio link during a fictional, apparently live, paranormal investigation.[16] However, the cinéma vérité style in which it was shot led to complaints from viewers who believed it depicted real events.[17] From 1995 to 1999, he hosted the BBC One daytime programme Going for a Song.[13] He again appeared as himself in Richard Curtis's 2003 romantic comedy film, Love Actually, interviewing the character Billy Mack, played by Bill Nighy.[18] In October 2003, Parkinson had a controversial interview with Meg Ryan while she was in the UK to promote In the Cut, which he called his most difficult television moment.[19]
On 26 June 2007, Parkinson announced his retirement:
After three enjoyable and productive years at ITV, and after 25 years of doing my talk show I have decided that this forthcoming series will be my last. I'm going to take next year off to write my autobiography and consider other television projects. My thanks go out to all those who have worked on the shows down the years and the viewers for their loyal support and occasional kind words.[20]In 2007, Parkinson appeared in the Australian soap Neighbours as himself.[21] On 24 November 2007, during recording of the final regular edition of his ITV chat show, broadcast on 16 December, Parkinson fought back tears as he was given an ovation.[22] On 'PARKINSON The Final Conversation' his guests were: Billy Connolly, Sir Michael Caine, David Attenborough, David Beckham, Jamie Cullum, Peter Kay, Dame Judi Dench & Dame Edna Everage. By December 2008 Parkinson held 458 credits as a presenter on his own and with others.[23]
Parkinson was a flagship of the BBC's prime-time schedule, attracting top names before the chat show circuit was part of the promotional mill.[24] He was able to interview wartime variety stars while attracting up-and-coming comedians such as Billy Connolly.[25] He was not afraid to allow an interviewee time to be themself, sometimes, as with Fred Astaire, Orson Welles, Alec Guinness, Paul McCartney, Muhammad Ali, George Michael, Madonna, John Cleese and Mel Gibson, devoting an entire programme to a guest who was considered especially noteworthy.[26] Parkinson stated that ""If I could save one interview from the thousands I have done, it would be the one-man show with Professor Jacob Bronowski.""[27]
He stated that the most remarkable man he ever interviewed was Muhammad Ali,[28] and regretted never interviewing Frank Sinatra or Don Bradman.[29][30]
Parkinson returned to hosting television in November 2012 with his new show Parkinson: Masterclass on Sky Arts.[31]
Parkinson took over BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs for the 1986 series after the 1985 death of its creator, Roy Plomley, whose widow was unhappy with Parkinson replacing him.[32] After six shows, he was criticised by the BBC Board of Management for ""a Yorkshire bias in the choice of castaways"" despite the fact that only one of his guests was born in the county.[33] Parkinson claimed that the criticism was ""a rearguard action by the establishment against the perceived desecration of an institution by an outsider"".[33] Parkinson stayed for two years until handing duties over to Sue Lawley.[32]
Between 1994 and 1996 he hosted Parkinson on Sport on BBC Radio 5 Live.[34] Between 1996 and 2007, he presented a morning show on BBC Radio 2 called Parkinson's Sunday Supplement; it featured newspaper and entertainment summaries with the help of journalists and a lengthy interview with a media personality. These were interspersed with music that demonstrated his penchant for jazz and big band. In October 2007, a few months after announcing his retirement from his television series, Parkinson said his radio show would also end.[35] The last programme was broadcast on Sunday 2 December 2007. Parkinson presented a mid-morning programme on London's LBC Newstalk 97.3FM.[36] He was considered responsible for the promotion of jazz singers to a more mainstream audience during the run of his BBC radio show.[37]
Parkinson's first article for The Sunday Times Colour Section, ""Living in a Museum"" (about the Suffolk village of Lavenham), appeared on 8 July 1962.[38] In 1965, The Sunday Times invited him to write a regular sports column, drawing on characters from his days in cricket and football.[39] These Sunday Times pieces and his articles for Punch magazine later formed the basis for two books, Cricket Mad and Football Daft.[40] In the 1980s, Parkinson wrote a series of children's books called The Woofits about a family of anthropomorphic dog-like creatures in the fictional Yorkshire coal-mining village of Grimeworth.[12] The books led to a TV series, which he narrated.[12][41] He wrote a sports column for The Daily Telegraph and was president of the Sports Journalists' Association.[42]
His autobiography, Parky, was published on 2 October 2008 by Hodder & Stoughton.[43] In April 2009, Parkinson wrote about the recently deceased Jade Goody in the Radio Times and described her as ""barely educated, ignorant and puerile"", adding: ""When we clear the media smokescreen from around her death, what we're left with is a woman who came to represent all that's paltry and wretched about Britain today.""[44] Bishop Jonathan Blake, who had presided over Goody's wedding, took exception to Parkinson's comments.[45]
In 1971, Parkinson was nominated as a candidate for the position of Rector of the University of Dundee. In one of the closest-ever contests for that position, he was very narrowly defeated by incumbent Peter Ustinov after two recounts. The result was controversial, as it was alleged earlier results indicated Parkinson had won and a further recount should have taken place to confirm the result. As a result, pressure grew for the poll to be rerun. While the university decreed that the original result was to stand, a new poll was organised by the Students' Association, which also featured the candidature of a goat. However, this time Ustinov won a decisive victory over Parkinson, the goat and Paul Foot.[46][47]
Parkinson is on the cover of the 1973 Paul McCartney and Wings album Band on the Run.[48] Paul McCartney told Parkinson that he would appear on his show if Parkinson appeared on the album cover, although it was not until 1999 that McCartney fulfilled his promise.[49]
In 2005, Parkinson appeared with comedian Peter Kay on the music video of the re-released ""Is This the Way to Amarillo"" for Comic Relief, which became a number one single.[50]
On 29 September 2008, Parkinson launched his website, which included online interviews. The site also includes a blog, giving Parkinson's views on news events as well as information about his compilation album, Michael Parkinson: My Life in Music, featuring favourite songs performed by Frank Sinatra, Michael Bublé, Dionne Warwick and others.[51]
Parkinson gave the keynote address in Sydney on Australia Day 2011, the first non-Australian to do so.[52] Parkinson used the publicity surrounding his Australia Day appearance to promote the abolition of the Australian monarchy.[53]
After finishing his talk show, Parkinson appeared in commercials for SunLife Guaranteed Over 50 Plan life insurance, stating that he liked ""its no-nonsense approach to business"".[54] His role in advertising the scheme was criticised by financial journalist Martin Lewis, who argued in 2012 that the plan was ""poor value"" for customers.[55]
Parkinson was a critic of the apartheid system governing South Africa until the 1990s and wrote a monthly sports column for Anti-Apartheid News, the official newspaper of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, upon its launch in 1965. He was particularly vocal on the topic of accommodating the wishes of the apartheid government in the sphere of international cricket, accusing the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) of being ""racialists of the worst kind"" in his Sunday Times column for initially excluding the South African-born mixed-race England cricketer Basil D'Oliveira from the England team touring South Africa in 1968–69. He also opposed a planned South African tour of England in 1970, characterising the MCC's defence of the tour as ""a rag-bag of cliche, red herring, zig-zagging, bobbing and weaving"", and judging their justification of it as having ""all the watertight qualities of a string bag"". He went on to write the foreword to Colin Shindler's history of the campaign against the 1970 tour, Barbed Wire and Cucumber Sandwiches. He was also a founding sponsor of the Anti-Nazi League in 1977.[56]
In 2009, Parkinson bemoaned the state of television generally, saying in a Radio Times interview that he was ""fed up with the rise of celebrities hosting shows, ridiculously titled documentaries and property shows"",[57] and also saying: ""In my television paradise there would be no more property programmes, no more police-chasing-yobbos-in-cars programmes and, most of all and please God, no more so-called documentary shows with titles like My 20-Ton Tumour, My Big Fat Head, Wolf Girl, Embarrassing Illnesses and The Fastest Man on No Legs.""[58] On 11 October 2010, Parkinson appeared on Richard Bacon's Radio 5 Live show, and was particularly critical of comedian and actor Russell Brand, saying: ""I don't see the point of him.""[59]
In 2013, Parkinson again criticised the course British television had taken, comparing series such as The One Show unfavourably with the broadcasting of the recently deceased Alan Whicker and David Frost, as well as stating the ""cult of youth"" had ""distorted the standards"". Parkinson spoke fondly of the time when ""producers were unencumbered by such irksome obstacles as compliance, health and safety and frustrating commissioning procedures"".[60] Alex Jones, presenter of The One Show, rejected Parkinson's criticism.[61]
In August 2014, Parkinson was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue.[62] Parkinson had declined to apologise to Helen Mirren over an interview he conducted in 1975, where he implied that serious actors could not have large breasts. Mirren later described him as a ""sexist old fart"".[63] On Piers Morgan's Life Stories in May 2019, Morgan suggested the comments were sexist. Parkinson replied: ""Well, maybe. But nobody got hurt, nobody died.""[64]
On 22 August 1959, he married Mary Heneghan, who was from Doncaster. They had three children, including a son, Michael, who married the comedian and actress Fiona Allen.[65] In the 1970s, Parkinson campaigned in support of birth control, having had a vasectomy in 1972 to allow his wife to stop taking oral contraceptive pills.[66]
Parkinson was a cricket fan and in 1990 hosted a World XI team against Yorkshire. Parkinson and his wife lived in Bray, Berkshire.[67] He met his friend Michel Roux when rowing down the River Thames on a Sunday to The Waterside Inn, then owned by Roux.[68] Parkinson acquired a Michelin-starred restaurant near his home in Berkshire in 2001.[69] In an interview with Irish broadcaster Gay Byrne on the RTÉ religious programme The Meaning of Life, he stated that he was an agnostic atheist.[70]
A resident of Thames Valley, Parkinson was a patron of the local animal charity Swan Lifeline that rescues and treats swans and waterfowl, supporting the cause by attending lunches to raise awareness and money for the charity.[71][72][73]
In 2010, the National Portrait Gallery acquired a painted portrait of Parkinson, which it had commissioned from the artist Jonathan Yeo, for its permanent collection.[74]
In 2013, Parkinson announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. In 2015 he was given the all-clear from the disease.[75]
Parkinson died at home on 16 August 2023 following a brief illness, aged 88.[76][77][78]
In 1999, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Lincoln and he also received an honorary D.Litt. from the University of Huddersfield in 2008.[79] He was invested as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Prince Charles in November 2000 for services to broadcasting, awarded in the 2000 Birthday Honours.[80][81] Parkinson was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2008 New Year's Honours List;[82] he remarked that he was ""not the type to get a knighthood"" coming as he did ""from Barnsley. They give it to anyone nowadays.""[83]
Parkinson was ranked eighth[84] in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals. In April 2006, Parkinson was awarded honorary patronage of the University Philosophical Society of Trinity College Dublin.[85] He was voted number 20 in ITV's ""TV's 50 Greatest Stars"".[86] On 4 June 2008 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.[87]
On 11 November 2008, he became the first Chancellor of Nottingham Trent University; the role included representing the university and conferring degrees at graduation ceremonies. Upon receiving the honour he said, ""I am honoured to be offered the chancellorship at Nottingham Trent University. In television I have always worked with young, ambitious people and I am keen to be involved in this university which helps to realise the aspirations of the young. It will also give me an opportunity to see what I missed!"".[88] Parkinson had served as president of the Sports Journalists' Association of Great Britain since 2005,[42] the largest national organisation of sports journalists in the world.

Alfredo James Pacino (/pəˈtʃiːnoʊ/ pə-CHEE-noh; Italian: [paˈtʃiːno]; born April 25, 1940) is an American actor. Known for his intense performances on stage and screen, Pacino is widely regarded as one of the greatest actors of all time.[a] His career spans more than five decades, during which he has earned many accolades, including an Academy Award, two Tony Awards, and two Primetime Emmy Awards, achieving the Triple Crown of Acting. He has also received four Golden Globe Awards, a BAFTA, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2001, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2007, the National Medal of Arts in 2011, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2016.[8][9][10][11] Films in which he has appeared have grossed over $3 billion worldwide.[12]
A method actor, Pacino studied at HB Studio and the Actors Studio, where he was taught by Charlie Laughton and Lee Strasberg. Pacino went on to receive the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Scent of a Woman (1992). His other Oscar-nominated roles were in The Godfather (1972), Serpico (1973), The Godfather Part II (1974), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), ...And Justice for All (1979), Dick Tracy (1990), Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), and The Irishman (2019). Pacino has starred in many other notable films, including The Panic in Needle Park (1971), Scarecrow (1973), Scarface (1983), Sea of Love (1989), The Godfather Part III (1990), Frankie and Johnny (1991), Carlito's Way (1993), Heat (1995), Donnie Brasco, The Devil's Advocate (both 1997), The Insider, Any Given Sunday (both 1999), Insomnia (2002), The Recruit (2003), Ocean's Thirteen (2007), Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), and House of Gucci (2021).
On television, Pacino has acted in multiple productions for HBO, including Angels in America (2003) and the Jack Kevorkian biopic You Don't Know Jack (2010), winning a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for each. Pacino starred in the Amazon Prime Video series Hunters (2020–23). He has also had an extensive career on stage. He is a two-time Tony Award winner, winning Best Featured Actor in a Play in Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie? (1969) and Best Actor in a Play for The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel (1977). He has also acted as Shylock in a 2004 feature film adaptation and 2010 stage production of The Merchant of Venice. 
Pacino made his directorial debut with the documentary Looking for Richard (1996). He directed and starred in Chinese Coffee (2000), Wilde Salomé (2011), and Salomé (2013). In 2006, he allowed for his likeness to be used in the video game Scarface: The World Is Yours. Since 1994, he has been the joint president of the Actors Studio.
Alfredo James Pacino was born in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, on April 25, 1940, the only child of Sicilian Italian-American parents Rose (née Gerardi) and Salvatore Pacino. His father had emigrated from San Fratello.[13]: xix [14]: 2  His parents divorced when he was two years old.[15][14]: 2  His mother took him to the South Bronx and they lived with her parents, Kate and James Gerardi.  They had emigrated from Corleone when young.[16][14]: 1–2  Pacino's father moved to California to work as an insurance salesman and restaurateur in Covina, California.[15][17]
In his teenage years, Pacino was known as ""Sonny"" to his friends.[13]: xix  He had ambitions to become a baseball player and was also nicknamed ""The Actor"".[13]: xix  He attended Herman Ridder Junior High School,[18] but soon dropped out of most of his classes except for English. He subsequently attended the High School of Performing Arts,[19] after gaining admission by audition. His mother disagreed with his decision and, after an argument, he left home. To finance his acting studies, Pacino took low-paying jobs as a messenger, busboy, janitor, and postal clerk,[15] as well as once working in the mailroom for Commentary.[20]
Pacino began smoking and drinking at age nine, and used marijuana casually at age 13, but he abstained from hard drugs.[13]: 9  His two closest friends died from drug abuse at the ages of 19 and 30.[13]: 8  Growing up in the South Bronx, Pacino got into occasional fights and was considered something of a troublemaker at school.[13]: 6  He acted in basement plays in New York's theatrical underground, but was rejected as a teenager by the Actors Studio.[13]: xix  Instead, Pacino joined the HB Studio, where he met acting teacher Charlie Laughton,[b] who became his mentor and best friend.[13]: xix  In this period, he was often unemployed or homeless, and sometimes slept on the street, in theaters, or at a friend's home.[13]: 14 [16]
In 1962, Pacino's mother died at the age of 43.[13]: 10  The following year, his maternal grandfather also died.[15] Pacino recalled it as the lowest point of his life and said, ""I was 22 and the two most influential people in my life had gone, so that sent me into a tailspin.""[17]
After four years at HB Studio, Pacino successfully auditioned for the Actors Studio.[13]: xix  The Actors Studio is a membership organization of professional actors, theater directors, and playwrights in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan.[21] Pacino studied ""method acting""[15] under acting coach Lee Strasberg, who appeared with Pacino in the films The Godfather Part II and in ...And Justice for All.[16]
During later interviews, he spoke about Strasberg and the Studio's effect on his career. ""The Actors Studio meant so much to me in my life. Lee Strasberg hasn't been given the credit he deserves ... Next to Charlie, it sort of launched me. It really did. That was a remarkable turning point in my life. It was directly responsible for getting me to quit all those jobs and just stay acting.""[13]: 15  In another interview he added, ""It was exciting to work for him [Lee Strasberg] because he was so interesting when he talked about a scene or talked about people. One would just want to hear him talk, because things he would say, you'd never heard before ... He had such a great understanding ... he loved actors so much.""[22]
In 2000, Pacino was selected as co-president of the Actors Studio, along with Ellen Burstyn and Harvey Keitel.[21]
In 2025, Pacino became the first movie star to meet with Pope Leo XIV.[23]
In 1967, Pacino spent a season at the Charles Playhouse in Boston, performing in Clifford Odets' Awake and Sing! (his first major paycheck: US$125 a week); and in Jean-Claude Van Itallie's America Hurrah. He met actress Jill Clayburgh on this play. They had a five-year romance and moved back to New York City.[14] In 1968, Pacino starred in Israel Horovitz's The Indian Wants the Bronx at the Astor Place Theatre, playing Murph, a street punk. The play opened January 17, 1968, and ran for 177 performances; it was staged in a double bill with Horovitz's It's Called the Sugar Plum, starring Clayburgh. Pacino won an Obie Award for Best Actor for his role, with John Cazale winning for Best Supporting Actor and Horowitz for Best New Play.[24] Martin Bregman saw the play and became Pacino's manager, a partnership that became fruitful in the years to come, as Bregman encouraged Pacino to do The Godfather, Serpico, and Dog Day Afternoon.[25] About his stage career, Pacino said, ""Martin Bregman discovered me ... I was 26, 25 ... he discovered me and became my manager. And that's why I'm here. I owe it to Marty, I really do"".[26]
Pacino took the production of The Indian Wants the Bronx to Italy for a performance at the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto. It was Pacino's first journey to Italy; he later recalled that ""performing for an Italian audience was a marvelous experience"".[14] Pacino and Clayburgh were cast in ""Deadly Circle of Violence"", an episode of the ABC television series NYPD, premiering November 12, 1968. Clayburgh at the time was also appearing on the soap opera Search for Tomorrow, playing the role of Grace Bolton. Her father would send the couple money each month to help with finances.[27]
On February 25, 1969, Pacino made his Broadway debut in Don Petersen's Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie? at the Belasco Theater, produced by A&P heir Huntington Hartford. It closed after 39 performances on March 29, 1969, but Pacino received rave reviews and won the Tony Award on April 20, 1969.[14] Pacino continued performing onstage in the 1970s, winning a second Tony Award for The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel and performing the title role in Richard III.[15] In the 1980s, Pacino again achieved critical success on stage while appearing in David Mamet's American Buffalo, for which Pacino was nominated for a Drama Desk Award.[15] Since 1990, Pacino's stage work has included revivals of Eugene O'Neill's Hughie, Oscar Wilde's Salome and in 2005 Lyle Kessler's Orphans.[28] Pacino found acting enjoyable and realized he had a gift for it while studying at The Actors Studio. However, his early work was not financially rewarding.[16] After his success on stage, Pacino made his film debut in 1969 with a brief appearance in Me, Natalie, an independent film starring Patty Duke.[29] In 1970, Pacino signed with the talent agency Creative Management Associates (CMA).[14] Pacino made his feature film debut portraying a heroin addict in The Panic in Needle Park (1971).
Francis Ford Coppola cast him as Michael Corleone in what became a blockbuster Mafia film, The Godfather (1972).[30] Although Jack Nicholson, Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, and the little-known Robert De Niro tried out for the part, Coppola selected Pacino, to the dismay of studio executives who wanted someone better known.[16][31] Pacino's performance earned him an Academy Award nomination, and offered a prime example of his early acting style, described by Halliwell's Film Guide as ""intense"" and ""tightly clenched"". Pacino boycotted the Academy Award ceremony, insulted at being nominated for the Supporting Acting award, as he noted that he had more screen time than co-star and Best Actor winner Marlon Brando—who also boycotted the awards, but for unrelated reasons.[32] In 1973, Pacino co-starred in Scarecrow with Gene Hackman, which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. That same year, Pacino was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor after starring in Serpico, based on the true story of New York City policeman Frank Serpico, who went undercover to expose the corruption of fellow officers.[32] In 1974, Pacino reprised his role as Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part II, which was the first sequel to win the Best Picture Oscar; Pacino was nominated a third time for an Oscar, this second nomination for the Corleone role being in the lead category.[32] Newsweek has described his performance in The Godfather Part II as ""arguably cinema's greatest portrayal of the hardening of a heart"".[33]
In 1975, he enjoyed further success with the release of Dog Day Afternoon, based on the true story of bank robber John Wojtowicz.[16] It was directed by Sidney Lumet, who had directed him in Serpico a few years earlier, and Pacino was again nominated for Best Actor.[34] In 1977, Pacino starred as a race-car driver in Bobby Deerfield, directed by Sydney Pollack, and received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama for his portrayal of the title role. His next film was the courtroom drama ...And Justice for All. Pacino was lauded by critics for his wide range of acting abilities, and nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for a fourth time.[34] He lost out that year to Dustin Hoffman in Kramer vs. Kramer—a role that Pacino had declined.[34] During the 1970s, Pacino had five Oscar nominations, including four for Best Actor for his performances in Serpico, The Godfather Part II, Dog Day Afternoon, and ...And Justice for All.[16]
Pacino's career slumped in the early 1980s; his appearances in the controversial Cruising, a film that provoked protests from New York's gay community,[35] and the comedy-drama Author! Author!, were critically panned.[15]
However, his performance in Scarface (1983), directed by Brian De Palma, proved to be a career highlight and a defining role.[16] Upon its initial release, the film was critically panned due to violent content, but later received critical acclaim.[36] The film did well at the box office, grossing over US$45 million domestically.[37] Pacino earned a Golden Globe nomination for his role as Cuban drug lord Tony Montana.[38]
In 1983, Pacino became a major donor for The Mirror Theater Ltd, alongside Dustin Hoffman and Paul Newman, matching a grant from Laurance Rockefeller.[39] The men were inspired to invest by their connection with Lee Strasberg, as Strasberg's daughter-in-law Sabra Jones was the founder and Producing Artistic Director of The Mirror. In 1985, Pacino offered the company his production of Hughie by Eugene O'Neill, but the company was unable to do it at the time due to the small cast.[39] In 1985, Pacino worked on his personal project, The Local Stigmatic, a 1969 off-Broadway play by the English writer Heathcote Williams. He starred in the play, remounting it with director David Wheeler and the Theater Company of Boston in a 50-minute film version. The film was not released theatrically, but was later released as part of the Pacino: An Actor's Vision box set in 2007.[16]
His 1985 film Revolution about a fur trapper during the American Revolutionary War, was a commercial and critical failure, which Pacino blamed on a rushed production,[40] resulting in a four-year hiatus from films. At this time Pacino returned to the stage. He mounted workshop productions of Crystal Clear, National Anthems and other plays; he appeared in Julius Caesar in 1988 in producer Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival. Pacino remarked on his hiatus from film: ""I remember back when everything was happening, '74, '75, doing The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui on stage and reading that the reason I'd gone back to the stage was that my movie career was waning! That's been the kind of ethos, the way in which theater's perceived, unfortunately.""[41] Pacino returned to film in 1989's Sea of Love,[16] when he portrayed a detective hunting a serial killer who finds victims through the singles column in a newspaper. The film earned solid reviews.[42] Pacino received an Academy Award nomination for playing Big Boy Caprice in the box office hit Dick Tracy in 1990, of which critic Roger Ebert described Pacino as ""the scene-stealer"".[43] Later in the year he followed this up in a return to one of his most famous characters, Michael Corleone, in The Godfather Part III (1990).[16]
In 1991, Pacino starred in Frankie and Johnny with Michelle Pfeiffer, who co-starred with Pacino in Scarface. Pacino played a recently paroled cook who begins a relationship with a waitress (Pfeiffer) in the diner where they work. It was adapted by Terrence McNally from his own off-Broadway play Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune (1987), that featured Kenneth Welsh and Kathy Bates. The film received mixed reviews, although Pacino later said he enjoyed playing the part.[44] Janet Maslin in The New York Times wrote, ""Mr. Pacino has not been this uncomplicatedly appealing since his Dog Day Afternoon days, and he makes Johnny's endless enterprise in wooing Frankie a delight. His scenes alone with Ms. Pfeiffer have a precision and honesty that keep the film's maudlin aspects at bay.""[45] For his portrayal of the irascible, blind U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade in Martin Brest's Scent of a Woman (1992)[16] Pacino won the Academy Award for Best Actor next year. He was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Glengarry Glen Ross, making Pacino the first male actor ever to receive two acting nominations for two movies in the same year, and to win for the lead role.[16]
Pacino starred alongside Sean Penn in the crime drama Carlito's Way in 1993, in which he played Carlito Brigante, a gangster released from prison with the help of his corrupt lawyer (Penn) and vows to go straight.[46] Pacino starred in Michael Mann's Heat (1995), in which he and Robert De Niro appeared on-screen together for the first time (though both Pacino and De Niro starred in The Godfather Part II, they did not share any scenes).[16][47] In 1996, Pacino starred in his theatrical docudrama Looking for Richard, a performance of selected scenes of William Shakespeare's Richard III and a broader examination of Shakespeare's continuing role and relevance in popular culture. The cast brought together for the performance included Alec Baldwin, Kevin Spacey, and Winona Ryder.[48]
Pacino played Satan in the supernatural thriller The Devil's Advocate (1997) which co-starred Keanu Reeves. The film was a success at the box office, taking US$150 million worldwide.[49] Roger Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times, ""The satanic character is played by Pacino with relish bordering on glee.""[50] In 1997's Donnie Brasco, Pacino played gangster ""Lefty"" in the true story of undercover FBI agent Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp) and his work in bringing down the Mafia from the inside.[51] In 1999, Pacino starred as 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman in the multi-Oscar nominated The Insider opposite Russell Crowe, and in Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday.[52][53]
Pacino won three Golden Globes since 2000; the first being the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2001 for lifetime achievement in motion pictures.[54] In 2000, Pacino starred alongside Jerry Orbach in a low-budget film adaptation of Ira Lewis' play Chinese Coffee, which was released to film festivals.[55] Shot almost exclusively as a one-on-one conversation between two main characters, the project took nearly three years to complete and was funded entirely by Pacino.[55] Chinese Coffee was included with Pacino's two other rare films he was involved in producing, The Local Stigmatic and Looking for Richard, on a special DVD box set titled Pacino: An Actor's Vision, which was released in 2007. Pacino produced prologues and epilogues for the discs containing the films.[56] Pacino turned down an offer to reprise his role as Michael Corleone in the computer game version of The Godfather (2006). As a result, Electronic Arts was not permitted to use Pacino's likeness or voice in the game, although his character does appear in it.[57] He did allow his likeness to appear in the video game adaptation of 1983's Scarface, the quasi-sequel Scarface: The World is Yours.[58]
In October 2002, Pacino starred in Bertolt Brecht's The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui for the National Actor's Theater and Complicite.[59] Directed by Simon McBurney, the production starred a host of Hollywood names, including John Goodman, Charles Durning, Tony Randall, Steve Buscemi, Chazz Palminteri, Paul Giamatti, Jacqueline McKenzie, Billy Crudup, Lothaire Bluteau, Dominic Chianese, and Sterling K. Brown.[60] The production was a critical success in which ""Pacino grabs and holds the attention like a coiled spring about to snap. He is all brooding menace and crocodile grimace, butchering his way to the top with unnervingly sinister glee.""[61] Director Christopher Nolan worked with Pacino on Insomnia, a remake of the Norwegian film of the same name, co-starring Robin Williams. Newsweek stated that ""he [Pacino] can play small as rivetingly as he can play big, that he can implode as well as explode"".[62] The film and Pacino's performance were well received, gaining a favorable rating of 93 percent on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes.[63] The film did moderately well at the box office, taking in $113 million worldwide.[64] His next film, S1m0ne, however, did not receive much critical praise or box office success.[65]

Peter Bradshaw described it as ""glorious"" in The Guardian.[103] Justin Chang wrote, ""De Niro, Pesci and Pacino are at the top of their game, in part because they aren't simply rehashing the iconic gangster types they've played before.""[104]

The Day of the Locust is a 1975 American satirical historical drama film directed by John Schlesinger. It stars Donald Sutherland, Karen Black, William Atherton, Burgess Meredith, Richard Dysart, John Hillerman, and Geraldine Page.
Set in Hollywood, California, just before World War II, the film conveys the alienation and desperation of a disparate group of people whose dreams of success do not come true. The screenplay by Waldo Salt is based on the 1939 novel of the same title by Nathanael West.
The Day of the Locust garnered scholarly attention for its nightmarish depiction and acerbic commentary of the Hollywood film industry, and critical attention for its visually implicit horror elements.
Aspiring artist and recent Yale graduate Tod Hackett arrives in 1930s Hollywood to work as an art department production illustrator at a major film studio. He rents an apartment in the San Bernardino Arms, a rundown bungalow court occupied by various people, many on the fringes of the industry: Among them are Faye Greener, a tawdry aspiring actress; her father Harry, an ex-vaudevillian; Abe Kusich, a dwarf who carries on a tempestuous relationship with his girlfriend, Mary; and Adore Loomis, a  young boy whose mother is hoping to turn him into a child star. Faye later meets Homer Simpson, a repressed accountant who lives in a nearby up-scale neighborhood, and comes to lust after her. Tod's unit has a crack in a wall caused by an earthquake; he puts a bright red flower in the crack. Tod befriends Faye, and attends a screening of a film in which she has a bit part, accompanied by Earle Shoop, a cowboy she is dating. Faye is disappointed with the film after finding that her appearance has been severely truncated. Tod attempts to romance Faye, but she coyly declines him, telling him she would only marry a rich man.
Tod attends a party at the Hollywood Hills mansion, where the partygoers indulge in watching stag films. Despite her hesitations, Faye continues to spend time with Tod. The two have a campfire in a canyon in the hills with Earle and his friend, Miguel. A drunken Tod becomes enraged when Faye dances with Miguel, and chases after her, apparently to rape her, but she fends him off. Some time later, Faye and Homer take Harry to a holy roller church gathering led by a female preacher known as Big Sister, who performs a public ""healing"" of him in an attempt to cure his heart ailment, but he subsequently dies. In order to pay for Harry's funeral costs, Faye begins prostituting herself.
The shy, obsessive Homer continues to vie for Faye's affections, caring for her after her father's death. The two eventually move in together, and Faye continues to hopelessly find employment as a movie extra. While filming a Waterloo-themed period drama, Faye escapes injury during a violent collapse of the set, and reunites with Tod, who witnesses the accident. Faye and Homer subsequently invite Tod to dinner. The three attend a dinner theater featuring a drag show as entertainment. During the dinner, Faye confesses to Tod that her relationship with Homer is sexless, but is loving and offers her security. Later, Faye and Homer host a party attended by Tod, Abe, Earle, Miguel, and Claude Estee, a successful art director. Faye prowls about throughout the party, attempting to impress Claude and the other men. While outside, Homer observes the various men drunkenly fawning over Faye through a window. When Faye notices him, she accuses him of being a peeping tom before throwing a vase through the window. Shortly after, Homer walks in on Faye having sex with Miguel. Tod passively ignores the scene, but Earle discovers it and begins fighting with Miguel.
Later, the premiere of The Buccaneer is taking place at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, attended by celebrities and a large crowd of fans and actors, including Faye. Tod, stuck in traffic due to the event, notices Homer walking aimlessly through the street. He attempts to talk to Homer, but Homer ignores him, seating himself on a bench near the theater. Adore, attending the premiere with his mother, teases Homer with a song that Faye would often sing before hitting him in the head with a rock. Enraged, Homer chases Adore through the crowd and into a parking lot. When Adore trips and falls, Homer begins violently stomping on him, ultimately killing him. Adore's dying screams draw the attention of the crowd, who come upon Homer standing on the child's bloodied corpse. A mob subsequently pursues Homer, beating him viciously, and a full-blown riot soon breaks out. Meanwhile, an announcer at the premiere mistakes the action across the street for excitement over the film. Faye is assaulted in the melee, Tod suffers a compound fracture to his leg, and a car is flipped over, igniting a fire that consumes the neighborhood. As Tod observes the frenzy, he witnesses the apparitions of numerous faceless, Goyaesque figures from his paintings descending on the scene.
On a morning shortly thereafter, Faye wanders into Tod's abandoned apartment. She sees everything was removed except for the flower in the wall crack, and her eyes well with tears.
Film scholar M. Keith Booker views The Day of the Locust as ""one of the nastiest film critiques ever produced of the film industry itself,""[1] that depicts Hollywood as a ""nightmare realm dominated by images of commodified sex and violence.""[2] Booker notes that the film aims to depict Hollywood and greater Los Angeles as a ""dumping ground upon which broken dreams can be discarded to make way for the ever newer dreams constantly being turned out by the American Culture Industry.""[2]
Lee Gambin of ComingSoon.net considers The Day of the Locust a ""non-horror film that is secretly a horror film...  a genuinely terrifying venture into the dark recesses of not only an industry that eats its product, vomits it back up and scoffs it down again, but a wonderful critique on human ugliness and desolation.""[3]
The apartment building was also used as a set for The Fortune.[4]
Released in the spring of 1975, The Day of the Locust was considered a box-office flop upon its release.[5]
In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it ""less a conventional film than it is a gargantuan panorama, a spectacle that illustrates West's dispassionate prose with a fidelity to detail more often found in a gimcracky Biblical epic than in something that so relentlessly ridicules American civilization... The movie is far from subtle, but it doesn't matter. It seems that much more material was shot than could be easily fitted into the movie, even at 144 minutes... It is reality projected as fantasy. Its grossness — its bigger-than-life quality — is so much a part of its style (and what West was writing about) that one respects the extravagances, the almost lunatic scale on which Mr. Schlesinger has filmed its key sequences.""[6]
Jay Cocks of Time said; ""The Day of the Locust looks puffy and overdrawn, sounds shrill because it is made with a combination of self-loathing and tenuous moral superiority. This is a movie turned out by the sort of mentality that West was mocking. 
Salt's adaptation... misses what is most crucial: West's tone of level rage and tilted compassion, his ability to make human even the most grotesque mockery.""[7]
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called it a ""daring, epic film... a brilliant one at times, and with a wealth of sharp-edged performances,"" citing that of Donald Sutherland as ""one of the movie's wonders,"" although he expressed some reservations, noting that ""somewhere on the way to its final vast metaphors, The Day of the Locust misplaces its concern with its characters. We begin to sense that they're marching around in response to the requirements of the story, instead of leading lives of their own. And so we stop worrying about them, because they're doomed anyway and not always because of their own shortcoming.""[8]
In the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum described the film as ""a painfully misconceived reduction and simplification... of the great Nathanael West novel about Hollywood... It misses crucial aspects of the book's surrealism and satire, though it has a fair number of compensations if you don't care about what's being ground underfoot - among them, Conrad Hall's cinematography and... one of Donald Sutherland's better performances.""[9]
Channel 4 deemed it ""fascinating, if flawed"" and ""by turns gaudy, bitter and occasionally just plain weird,"" adding ""great performances and magnificent design make this a spectacular and highly entertaining film.""[10]
Greg Ferrara for TCM, wrote ""...every bit as powerful as any movie on the movie industry out there and, in my opinion, conveys the themes and metaphors of the book in exactly the right tone.  They didn’t get it wrong at all, they got it perfectly right by telling the story, cinematically, in a very different way than the book.  It’s harsh, brutal, cruel and unrelenting.  I’ve rarely beheld a more pessimistic movie but it’s [sic] point, about all this fraud and hopelessness around us is both well-presented and well-taken.""[11]
The film was shown at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition.[12] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 63% from 35 reviews. The consensus summarizes: ""Although its source material's themes are sometimes beyond The Day of the Locust's grasp, this is a consistently watchable adaptation that gains its own emotional power.""[13]

On January 31, 2020, One Medical began trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange.[10][11]
During the early stages of vaccine distribution, One Medical was accused of administering the COVID-19 vaccine to ineligible patients in several states.[12] This resulted in a Congressional investigation.[13][14] The investigation concluded that One Medical sought to use its access to COVID vaccines for financial gain, by pushing those looking for vaccines towards its own paid memberships, and that it provided early access vaccines to those with insider connections at the company.[15]
In September 2021, One Medical acquired Iora Health.[16]
In 2024, Amazon's then-other healthcare offering Amazon Clinic was integrated with One Medical to become its pay-per-visit services.[17]
In July 2022, it was announced that Amazon, Inc. agreed to acquire One Medical for about $3.9 billion in an all-cash deal.[18] Prior to the announcement, pharmacy chain CVS Health had also bid for the company.[19] Amazon formally acquired One Medical on February 22, 2023.[6]
In November 2023, Amazon began offering discounted One Medical memberships to Amazon Prime customers.[20][21][22][23]
Following news of the acquisition, several commentators and public advocacy groups expressed concern that the deal would harm patient privacy.[24][25] U.S. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, urged the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to scrutinize the deal.[26]
Oregon's health agency, the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) was empowered to assess the deal as there were five One Medical clinics operating in the state as of 2022. In December 2022, the OHA ultimately concluded in its preliminary review of the acquisition that the acquisition would not lead to a substantial reduction in affordable healthcare in the state. As such, the OHA approved the acquisition.[27]
In 2023, One Medical was listed as a sponsor of Tru Con, an annual conference of the Truman Center, a national security think tank.[28]
Following the announcement of the acquisition, observers speculated that the deal may face antitrust scrutiny. In September 2022, a SEC filing by 1Life Healthcare revealed that the FTC had begun a probe into the deal.[29]
On February 21, 2023, the FTC ultimately declined to challenge the deal with an antitrust lawsuit before the acquisition was completed.[30] The acquisition was officially completed the next day, on February 22, 2023.[6] The FTC clarified that it is still investigating the merger and may still choose to challenge the acquisition.[30]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A.V._Club,The A.V. Club,"
The A.V. Club is an online newspaper[2] and entertainment website featuring reviews, interviews, and other articles that examine films, music, television, books, games, and other elements of pop-culture media. The A.V. Club was created in 1993 as a supplement to its satirical parent publication, The Onion. While it was a part of The Onion's 1996 website launch, The A.V. Club had minimal presence on the website at that point.
A 2005 website redesign placed The A.V. Club in a more prominent position, allowing its online identity to grow. Unlike The Onion, The A.V. Club is not satirical.[3] The publication's name is a reference to audiovisual (AV) clubs typical of American high schools.[4]
In 1993, five years after the founding of The Onion, Stephen Thompson, a student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, launched an entertainment section of the newspaper.[5] Its name refers to audio visual clubs offered by American high schools during the late 20th century for students to use and learn about equipment like speakers and projectors.[4]
Alongside The Onion's move from Madison, Wisconsin, to New York City in early 2001, the A.V. Club staff also left Madison to move into The Onion's satellite office in Chicago. However, Thompson chose to stay in Madison, and in December 2004, Thompson was fired from his position as founding editor.[6][7]
In 1996, both The Onion and The A.V. Club debuted on the Internet.[8] The A.V. Club was originally a subsection of the main theonion.com domain.[9] The supplement was moved to its own domain name, theavclub.com,[10] before the 2005 acquisition of the shorter avclub.com domain name.[11] The latter change coincided with a redesign that incorporated reader comments and blog content. In 2006, the website shifted its content model to add content on a daily, rather than weekly, basis. Some contributors have become established as freelance writers and editors.[citation needed]
According to Sean Mills, then-president of The Onion, the A.V. Club website first reached more than 1 million unique visitors in October 2007.[12] In late 2009, the website was reported to have received more than 1.4 million unique visitors and 75,000 comments per month.[13]
At its peak, the print version of The A.V. Club was available in 17 different cities.[14] Localized sections of the website were also maintained with reviews and news relevant to specific cities. The print version and localized websites were gradually discontinued, and in December 2013, print publication ceased production in the last three markets.[15]
On 9 December 2010, the website ComicsComicsMag revealed that a capsule review for the book Genius, Isolated: The Life and Art of Alex Toth had been fabricated. The book had not yet been published nor even completed by the authors.[16] After the review was removed, editor Keith Phipps posted an apology on the website, stating that the reporter being assigned to review the book could not locate a copy of it (""for obvious reasons""), so they fabricated it.[17] Leonard Pierce, the author of the review, was terminated from his freelance role with the website.[18]
On 13 December 2012, long-time writer and editor Keith Phipps, who oversaw the website after Stephen Thompson left, stepped down from his role as editor of The A.V. Club. He said, ""Onion, Inc. and I have come to a mutual parting of the ways.""[19][20][21] On 2 April 2013, long-time film review editor and critic Scott Tobias stepped down as film editor of The A.V. Club. He said via Twitter, ""After 15 great years @theavclub, I step down as Film Editor next Friday.""[22]
On 26 April 2013, long-time writers Nathan Rabin, Tasha Robinson, and Genevieve Koski announced they would also be leaving the website to begin work on a new project with Scott Tobias and Keith Phipps.[23] Koski also said that she would continue to write freelance articles.[24] Writer Noel Murray announced he would be joining their new project, while continuing to contribute to The A.V. Club in a reduced capacity.[23] On 30 May 2013, those six writers were announced as becoming part of the senior staff of The Dissolve, a film website run by Pitchfork Media.[25]
In April and June 2014, senior staff writers Kyle Ryan, Sonia Saraiya, and Emily St. James left the website for positions at Entertainment Weekly, Salon, and Vox Media, respectively.[26][27] In 2015, Ryan returned to Onion, Inc. for a position in development.[28] Following his departure from The Dissolve earlier that month, Nathan Rabin returned to write freelance for the A.V. Club website in May 2015.[29] He renewed his regular column ""My World of Flops"" Archived 6 November 2013 at the Wayback Machine. The Dissolve folded in July 2015.[30]
In January 2016, Univision Communications acquired a 40% controlling stake in Onion Inc., the parent company of The A.V. Club.[31] Later that year, Univision also purchased Gawker Media and reorganized several of Gawker's sites into the new Gizmodo Media Group, a division of Fusion Media Group.[32]
On 16 February 2017, The A.V. Club's editor-at-large, John Teti, posted an article on the website announcing the upcoming release of a television series, titled The A.V. Club, based on the website.[33] The series, hosted by Teti, began airing on Fusion on 16 March 2017 and ran for one season.[34] The series featured news, criticism, and discussions about various popular-culture topics and featured staff members from the website.
The site was subsequently migrated from Bulbs, an internal content management system developed by Onion Inc. to the Gawker-developed Kinja platform.[35][36] Audience reviews hosted on the previous site were deleted and the Kinja comment system was heavily derided by the site's commenting community, leading to a sharp decline in activity.
In March 2018, employees announced they had unionized with the Writers Guild of America, East.[37] The union comprises ""all of the creative staffs at Onion Inc.: The A.V. Club, The Onion, ClickHole, The Takeout, Onion Labs, and Onion Inc.'s video and art departments.""[38] (ClickHole was acquired by Cards Against Humanity in February 2020.[39]) The union was recognized on 20 April 2018 and reached a contract agreement with management on 20 December 2018.[40] The contract includes ""annual pay increases, minimum pay grades, strong diversity and anti-harassment language, just cause, union security, editorial independence, intellectual property rights, and an end to permalancers.""[41]
In July 2018, Univision announced it was looking for a buyer for the entire Gizmodo Group.[42] In April 2019, Gizmodo and The Onion were sold to private-equity firm Great Hill Partners, which combined them into a new company named G/O Media.[43][44] In July 2019, executive editor Laura M. Browning and managing editor Caitlin PenzeyMoog left.[45] In early 2020, former People magazine and Entertainment Weekly editor Patrick Gomez was named editor-in-chief, and it was announced that the site was opening a Los Angeles bureau.[46] In August 2021, Yahoo! Entertainment and E! Online alum Scott Robson joined to lead the team.[47]
On 18 January 2022, the union representing staff at the website announced that all seven staff members based in Chicago had taken severance as opposed to accepting a mandatory move of work location to Los Angeles.[48] This predominantly affected the senior staff of the site and comprised the managing editor, film editor, TV editor, associate editor, senior writer, assistant editor, and editorial coordinator.[49]
In March 2024, it was reported that G/O Media had sold The A.V. Club to Paste Media, who had previously bought the dormant G/O Media sites Jezebel and Splinter News for a relaunch.[44][50] This resulted in The A.V. Club being completely separated from The Onion, with G/O Media selling The Onion to Global Tetrahedron the following month.[51] Two employees were laid off as part of the transition. Paste Media CEO Josh Jackson stressed that Paste and The A.V. Club would not be consolidated together and assured that the comments, briefly disabled by G/O Media, would be restored.[52]
In June 2024, various changes were announced, including that the A.V. Undercover web series would be revived after a 7-year hiatus, A.I. written articles during the G/O Media era would be removed, familiar writers would return (including Nathan Rabin and Ignatiy Vishnevetsky), and a subscriber program will be introduced.[53] In July 2024, Danette Chavez, a writer and editor for The A.V. Club from 2015 to 2022, rejoined the website as editor-in-chief.[54]
In 2017, The A.V. Club won an Eisner Award for ""Best Comics-related Periodical/Journalism"" (for works published in 2016).[55] The award went to writers Oliver Sava, Caitlin Rosberg, Shea Hennum, and Tegan O'Neil. The award also went to editor Caitlin PenzeyMoog.[56]
Starting in 1999, only lists written by individual writers were published. Beginning in 2006, The A.V. Club began publishing website-consensus, year-end album and film rankings, together with lists created by individual writers, followed by annual rankings of television shows from 2010 onward. Additionally, decade-end lists were published for the 2000s and 2010s.[57][58]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauer_Consumer_Media,Bauer Media Group,"
Heinrich Bauer Publishing (German: Heinrich Bauer Verlag KG), trading as Bauer Media Group, is a German multimedia conglomerate headquartered in Hamburg. It operates worldwide and owns more than 600 magazines, over 400 digital products and 50 radio and TV stations, as well as print shops, postal, distribution and marketing services. It also operates out-of-home advertising across Europe, following its takeover of Clear Channel Europe in April 2025. Bauer has a workforce of approximately 11,000 in 17 countries.[2]
Bauer Verlagsgruppe has been managed by five generations of the Bauer family.[3] In November 2010, Heinz Heinrich's daughter Yvonne Bauer became CEO and 85% owner of the Bauer Media Group after joining the family business in 2005.[4]
In February 2021, Bauer Media Group announced it was to acquire Ireland's Communicorp Group, subject to regulatory approval.[5] The acquisition was completed on 1 June 2021.
The company was founded in 1875 by the German lithographer Johann Andreas Ludolph Bauer (1852–1941). He opened a printing shop in Hamburg at the age of 23. The focus was on the production of business cards. The company was initially taken over by his son Heinrich Friedrich Matthias (1874–1949) and later continued by his grandson Alfred (1898–1984), who joined the company in 1918 and became a partner in 1935. In 1903, the company bought the Rothenburgsorter Zeitung, a for free advertising paper, and incorporated a stationery business. A high-speed printing press and a typesetting machine were among the new working capital of the general partnership J. A. L. Bauer & Sons, also founded in 1903, which now employed around 20 people.
CEO Alfred Bauer became member of the Nazi Party in 1939. By ingratiation of Bauer Verlag to the Nazi regime, the Bauer journals had more success. This was identified in research conducted in 2020 by the Norddeutscher Rundfunk media magazine Zapp and the news magazine Der Spiegel, which demonstrated a proximity of the content of Rundfunkkritik or Funk-Wacht (Radio Watch) to Nazi ideology. In 1942, however, Funk-Wacht was discontinued due to a lack of paper.[6]
In 2024 the company commissioned a comprehensive study from the Historiker-Genossenschaft eG, a cooperative of historical researchers, to examined the corporate history of the Bauer Media Group during the Nazi era, and published the results.[6]
Originally a small printing house in Germany, Bauer Media Group entered the UK with the launch of Bella magazine in 1987. Under the name of H Bauer Publishing they became Britain's third largest publisher. Bauer further expanded in the UK with the purchase of Emap Consumer Media and Emap Radio in 2008.[4]
In the UK there are two divisions of the Bauer Media Group. The original UK business trades as H Bauer Publishing. Its sister company is known as Bauer Media (Bauer Consumer Media Ltd) with CEO Paul Keenan.[4]
Titles include women's weekly and TV listings magazines Bella, Take a Break, that's life!, TV Choice and Total TVGuide along with a number of puzzle magazines.[citation needed]
In 1987, Bella was H Bauer's first venture into publishing in the UK. In 1990, H Bauer launched a weekly women's magazine named Take a Break. H Bauer also has a sister title, that's life! that launched in 1995. The H Bauer Publishing brand also includes puzzle magazines that carry the Take a Break name.[7]
In 1991, Bauer launched its first TV listings publishing with the launch of TV Quick magazine. (Prior to the de-regulation of TV listings in March 1991, BBC listings had been restricted by law to Radio Times and ITV/Channel 4 listings to TV Times.) TV Quick ceased publication in July 2010. In 1999 H Bauer launched TV Choice at a much lower price point than other titles on the market. TV Choice overtook its main competitor in the February 2008 audited ABCs and has been the number one weekly newsstand magazine in the UK since. In September 2003, H Bauer launched Total TV Guide to cover the increasing number of programmes available on Freeview and satellite or cable services.[8]

Q began as a music magazine published monthly in the United Kingdom. Originally it was to be called Cue (named after the act of cueing a record to play).

The Q music brand has expanded to Radio and Television, with Q Radio and Q TV being music entertainment that specialises in indie, rock and alternative. Q also holds annual music awards in the UK, known as Q Awards. In spring 2010, Bauer attempted to unilaterally impose a new contract on all photographers and writers, which was set to take away their copyright and off-load liability for libel or copyright infringement from the publisher onto the contributor. 200 photographers and writers from Q and Bauer's other music magazines, Kerrang! and Mojo, were reported as refusing to work under the new terms.[12][needs update]
In 2020, Q magazine was scrapped alongside sister publication Planet Rock[13] (joining real-life publication Simply You, Practical Photography and car magazine Modern Classics as titles closed by Bauer) as a buyer could not be found to continue the publication beyond issue Q415, with Kelsey Media deciding to buy Sea Angler, Car Mechanics and Your Horse instead.[14]
Kerrang! is a brand that specialises in rock music.[15] It was originally a magazine with Kerrang! Radio being launched in 2004.

On 2 April 2020, Bauer Media Group announced that it would wind up its New Zealand magazine titles in direct response to magazines having been stopped from being published under New Zealand's Level 4 restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. This led to the suspension of several titles including Woman's Day, New Zealand Woman's Weekly, the New Zealand Listener, The Australian Women's Weekly, North & South, Next, Metro, Air New Zealand's inflight magazine Kia Ora, and Your Home & Garden, leaving about 200 former employees unemployed. While Broadcasting Minister Kris Faafoi said that the Government could have provided financial relief through a wage subsidy scheme or the business finance guarantee, the company had not sought it.[40][41][42][43] Many of the magazines previously owned by Bauer publish articles on the website Noted (noted.co.nz).[44] In June 2020, Bauer Media Australia was sold to Mercury Capital.[45][46] In September 2020, Bauer Media Australia was rebranded as Are Media.[47][48]
In 2017, Bauer Media Group was successfully sued by the Australian actor Rebel Wilson for defamation in the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia. This was the biggest payout for defamation of its kind in Australian legal history.[49]
Bauer Media Group printed a series of lies and false articles against the actress in an attempt to defame her. This reportedly led to the actress being overlooked for a number of big Hollywood roles. Wilson was awarded A$4,567,472. The award consisted of $650,000 in general damages and $3,917,472 in special damages.[50]
Wilson's lawyer Richard Leder, said ""Today's verdict is a significant record — it's about four times the highest previous verdict in a defamation case in Australia"".
While the guilty defamation decision stands the amount of payment was later appealed and reduced.[51] Wilson announced in July 2018 she will be taking the matter further to a higher court in Australia.

In June 2015, Penske Media Corporation formed a partnership with Shutterstock to be the exclusive licensor of imagery from PMC's fashion and entertainment archives.[21] The following month, PMC purchased Gold Derby, a data platform and website that utilizes user and professional predictions to predict the outcome and winners of global awards shows and events.[22] In January 2016, PMC acquired independent film and television publication IndieWire from SnagFilms, Inc. for an undisclosed amount of money.[23]
In January 2017, Penske Media Corporation entered into a joint venture for the Robb Report with Rockbridge, the private equity firm of Dan Gilbert.[24] In December 2017, Penske Media acquired a majority stake of Rolling Stone magazine from Wenner Media.[25] In 2018, it expanded further into music with an investment in BuzzAngle Music.[26] Additional acquisitions from 2017 to 2018 include SHE Media, Sourcing Journal,[27][28] and Art Media Holdings, which includes Art in America and ARTnews.[29]
On September 23, 2020, it was announced that PMC would assume operations of the MRC Media & Info publications, including Variety's main competitor, The Hollywood Reporter, and Billboard magazine, under a joint venture with MRC known as PMRC. In turn, MRC will form a second joint venture that will develop content tied to PMRC publications.[30] In 2021, it purchased a 50 percent stake in South by Southwest,[31] and sold Hollywood Life,[32] website about entertainment, celebrity, and fashion news targets women ages 18 to 35 and attracts an audience of 35 million visitors per month, founded and run by former US Weekly, Marie Claire, and Glamour editor, Bonnie Fuller.[33][34]
In 2022, the company acquired a majority stake in Las Vegas' Life Is Beautiful Music & Art Festival, which was placed under the Rolling Stone division.[35] The same year, it acquired the contemporary art magazine Artforum and Bookforum. Bookforum subsequently ceased publications on December 12 of that year.[36][37] It also launched the LA3C, a music festival in Los Angeles, California.[38]
In January 2023, a stake in Dick Clark Productions was sold to PMC via the joint venture Penske Media Eldridge.[39][40] In February 2023, PMC became the largest shareholder in Vox Media, acquiring a 20% stake in the company with Jay Penske joining Vox Media's board.[41]
In August 2025, PMC sold Boy Genius Report and TVLine to Static Media.[42][43]
PMC owns and operates Variety magazine, a trade paper for the entertainment industry founded in 1905, as well as its various digital and data platforms. PMC purchased the publication in 2012 from Reed Elsevier for approximately $30 million.[16]
PMC first became the majority owner of Rolling Stone by purchasing a 51 percent stake in the company from Wenner Media in 2017,[25] and then acquired the 49 percent stake held by BandLab Technologies in January 2019 to become its full owner.[44] Rolling Stone is an international[45][46] media brand which focuses on popular culture, now including magazines published in 15 countries[47] such as China, Australia, India and the United Kingdom. The original American Rolling Stone magazine  was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by magazine publisher Jann Wenner and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine shifted focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors and popular AT40-based music. Under PMC, Rolling Stone became a monthly publication in America, but still mixed music coverage with politics and articles on popular culture.[48]
The Robb Report is an American English-language luxury-lifestyle magazine featuring various products, including automobiles, aviation, boating, real estate, and watches.
Deadline, also known as Deadline Hollywood or Deadline.com and previously known as news blog Deadline Hollywood Daily, is an online magazine founded by Nikki Finke in 2006. The blog had initially been operated by publisher LA Weekly prior to being purchased by Penske Media in June 2009.
Fairchild Fashion Media is a digital media, publishing, and events company that owns multiple fashion-related content properties. PMC purchased Fairchild properties from Condé Nast in late 2014. These publications included WWD (Women's Wear Daily), Footwear News, Beauty Inc., M, and Fairchild Summits. WWD is often considered the ""Bible of the fashion industry.""[49] The other properties are considered leading business-to-business publications offering news and insights into various fashion and beauty niches.[49]
On April 2, 2020, PMC announced that it would launch Sportico—a new vertical focusing on sports business and media.[50] It launched on June 30, 2020,[51] hiring several reporters who previously worked at the sports business division of Bloomberg News.[52] On December 14, 2020, Sportico acquired The Intercollegiate, adding two writers from the college sports media outlet, to grow its coverage of the college sports industry.[53]
BollywoodLife.com is an entertainment and celebrity news website reporting on Indian popular culture. It is part of Penske Media Corporation, having reportedly attained more than 20 million monthly active users, as well as over 5 million social media followers.[54][55][56]
Gold Derby was founded in 2000 as an entertainment news forum, and was acquired by PMC in 2015 after the site pivoted to awards predictions.[57][58] It has awarded the Gold Derby TV and Film Awards since 2002.[59]
Other properties under the PMC banner include the Boy Genius Report (or BGR.com), TVLine, SHE Media, and Sourcing Journal. BGR.com is a tech and gadget blog originally founded by Jonathan Geller and purchased by PMC in 2010.[13] PMC has also been an investor in the strategic event management company LDJ Productions since 2020.[60]
Penske Media co-owns its headquarters at 475 Fifth Avenue after partnering with RFR Holding to purchase it in 2022.[61]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Awards,Empire Awards,"
The Empire Awards was an annual British awards ceremony honouring cinematic achievements in the local and global film industry. Winners were awarded the Empire Award statuette. The awards, first presented in 1996, were presented by the British film magazine Empire with the winners voted by the readers of the magazine.
The 23rd Empire Awards was the final ceremony, held on 18 March 2018 in London to honour films released in 2017.[1] The awards were sponsored by Jameson Irish Whiskey from the 14th Empire Awards[2][3] and were thenceforth officially called the Jameson Empire Awards. The official sponsor of the Awards changed to Rakuten TV for the 23rd Empire Awards. The Empire Awards ceremonies were discontinued after 2018 for unknown reasons.
As of the 19th Empire Awards four honorary awards were handed out:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research,Wikipedia:No original research,"
Wikipedia articles must not contain original research. On Wikipedia, original research means material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published source exists. By ""exists"", the community means that the reliable source must have been published and still exist—somewhere in the world, in any language, whether or not it is reachable online—even if no source is currently named in the article.[a] This includes any analysis or synthesis of published material that  reaches or implies a conclusion not stated by the sources. To demonstrate that one is not adding original research, one must be able to cite reliable, published sources that are directly related to the topic of the article and directly support[b] the material being presented.
The prohibition against original research means that all material added to articles must be verifiable, in the sense that it must be possible for an editor to find a reliable, published source that directly supports this material.  An inline citation to a reliable source must be provided for all direct quotations, contentious matter about living people, and for anything challenged or likely to be challenged—but even for material that is not required to have an inline citation, a reliable source that could be cited in support this material must have been published and still exist.[c] For example, the statement ""the capital of France is Paris"" does not require a source to be cited, nor is it original research, because it is not something that one thought up, and because it is easily verifiable; therefore, no one is likely to object to it, and everyone knows that sources exist for it, even if they are not cited. The statement is verifiable, even if not verified.
Despite the need for reliable sources, one must not plagiarize them or violate their copyrights. Rewriting source material in one's own words while retaining the substance is not considered original research.
""No original research"" (NOR) is one of three core content policies that, along with Neutral point of view and Verifiability, determines the type and quality of material acceptable in articles. Because these policies work in harmony, they should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should familiarize themselves with all three. For questions about whether any particular edit constitutes original research, see the No original research noticeboard.
This policy does not apply to talk pages and other pages which evaluate article content and sources, such as deletion discussions or policy noticeboards.
Wikipedia is fundamentally built on research that has been collected and organized from reliable sources, as described in content policies such as this one. If no reliable independent sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article about it. If a user discovers something new, Wikipedia is not the place to announce such a discovery.
The best practice is to research the most reliable sources on the topic and summarize what they say in one's own words, with each statement in the article being verifiable in a source that makes that statement explicitly. Source material should be carefully summarized or rephrased without changing its meaning or implication, going beyond what the sources express, or using them in ways inconsistent with the intention of the source, such as using material out of context. In short, one must stick to the sources.
Any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be supported by a reliable source. Material for which no reliable source can be found is considered original research. The only way one can show that one's edit is not original research is to cite a reliable published source that contains the same material. Even with well-sourced material, if one uses it out of context, or to state or imply a conclusion not directly and explicitly supported by the source, one is engaging in original research, which see below.
In general, the most reliable sources are:
However, note that higher standards than this are required for medical claims.
As a rule of thumb, the more people engaged in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the writing, the more reliable the publication. Self-published material, whether on paper or online, is generally not regarded as reliable. See self-published sources for exceptions.
Information in an article must be verifiable in the references cited. In general, article statements should not rely on unclear or inconsistent passages or on passing comments. Any passages open to multiple interpretations should be precisely cited or avoided. A summary of extensive discussion should reflect the conclusions of the source. Drawing conclusions not evident in the reference is original research regardless of the type of source. References must be cited in context and on topic.
Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources, and to a lesser extent, on tertiary sources and primary sources. Secondary or tertiary sources are needed to establish the topic's notability and avoid novel interpretations of primary sources. All analyses and interpretive or synthetic claims about primary sources must be referenced to a secondary or tertiary source and must not be an original analysis of the primary-source material by Wikipedia editors.
Appropriate sourcing can be a complicated issue, and these are general rules. Deciding whether primary, secondary, or tertiary sources are appropriate in any given instance is a matter of good editorial judgment and common sense, and should be discussed on article talk pages. A source may be considered primary for one statement but secondary for a different one. Even a given source can contain both primary and secondary source material for one particular statement. For the purposes of this policy, primary, secondary and tertiary sources are defined as follows:[d]


Do not combine material from multiple sources to state or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. Similarly, do not combine different parts of one source to state or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by the source. If one reliable source says A and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C not mentioned by either of the sources. This would be improper editorial synthesis of published material to imply a new conclusion, which is original research.[k] ""A and B, therefore, C"" is acceptable only if a reliable source has published the same argument concerning the topic of the article. If a single source says ""A"" in one context, and ""B"" in another, without connecting them, and does not provide an argument of ""therefore C"", then ""therefore C"" cannot be used in any article.
Here are two sentences showing simple examples of improper editorial synthesis. Both halves of the first sentence may be reliably sourced but are combined to imply that the UN has failed to maintain world peace. If no reliable source has combined the material in this way, it is original research.
N The United Nations' stated objective is to maintain international peace and security, but since its creation there have been 160 wars throughout the world.
In this second sentence, the opposite is implied using the same material, illustrating how easily such material can be manipulated when the sources are not adhered to:
N The United Nations' stated objective is to maintain international peace and security, and since its creation there have been only 160 wars throughout the world.
Here are two paragraphs showing more complex examples of editorial synthesis. They are based on an actual Wikipedia article about a dispute between two authors, here called Smith and Jones. This first paragraph is fine because each of the sentences is carefully sourced, using a source that refers to the same dispute:
Y Smith stated that Jones committed plagiarism by copying references from another author's book. Jones responded that it is acceptable scholarly practice to use other people's books to find new references.
This second paragraph demonstrates improper editorial synthesis:
N If Jones did not consult the original sources, this would be contrary to the practice recommended in the Harvard Writing with Sources manual, which requires citation of the source actually consulted. The Harvard manual does not call violating this rule ""plagiarism"". Instead, plagiarism is defined as using a source's information, ideas, words, or structure without citing them.
The second paragraph is original research because it expresses a Wikipedia editor's opinion that, given the Harvard manual's definition of plagiarism, Jones did not commit it. Making the second paragraph policy-compliant would require a reliable source specifically commenting on the Smith and Jones dispute and making the same point about the Harvard manual and plagiarism. In other words, that precise analysis must have been published by a reliable source concerning the topic before it can be published on Wikipedia.
Because of copyright laws in several countries, there may be relatively few images available for use on Wikipedia. Editors are therefore encouraged to upload their own images, releasing them under appropriate Creative Commons licenses or other free licenses. Original images created by a Wikimedian are not considered original research, so long as they do not illustrate or introduce unpublished ideas or arguments, the core reason behind the ""No original research"" policy. Image captions are subject to this policy no less than statements in the body of the article.
It is not acceptable for an editor to use photo manipulation to distort the facts or position illustrated by an image. Manipulated images should be prominently noted as such. Any manipulated image where the encyclopedic value is materially affected should be posted to Wikipedia:Files for discussion.
Images of living persons must not present the subject in a false or disparaging light; see WP:Biographies of living persons § Images.
Most images wholly generated by AI should not be used in mainspace; see WP:Image use policy § AI-generated images.
Faithfully translating sourced material into English, or transcribing spoken words from audio or video sources, is not considered original research. For information on how to handle sources that require translation, see WP:Verifiability § Non-English sources.
Source information does not need to be in prose form: Any form of information, such as maps, charts, graphs, and tables may be used to provide source information. Any straightforward reading of such media is not original research provided that there is consensus among editors that the techniques used are correctly applied and a meaningful reflection of the sources.
Routine calculations do not count as original research, provided there is consensus among editors that the results of the calculations are correct, and a meaningful reflection of the sources. Basic arithmetic, such as adding numbers, converting units, or calculating a person's age, is almost always permissible. See also Category:Conversion templates.
Mathematical literacy may be necessary to follow a ""routine"" calculation, particularly for articles on mathematics or in the hard sciences. In some cases, editors may show their work in a footnote.
Comparisons of statistics present particular difficulties. Editors should not compare statistics from sources that use different methodologies.
Wikipedia's content is determined by previously published information rather than by the personal beliefs or experiences of its editors. Even if you're sure something is true, it must be verifiable before you can add it. The policy says that all challenged or likely to be challenged material and all quotations need a reliable source; what counts as a reliable source is described at WP:Verifiability § Reliable sources.
The prohibition against original research limits the extent to which editors may present their own points of view in articles. By reinforcing the importance of including verifiable research produced by others, this policy promotes the inclusion of multiple points of view. Consequently, this policy reinforces our neutrality policy. In many cases, there are multiple established views of any given topic. In such cases, no single position, no matter how well researched, is authoritative. It is not the responsibility of any individual editor to research all points of view. But when incorporating research into an article, editors must provide context for this point of view by indicating how prevalent the position is and whether it is held by a majority or minority.
The inclusion of a view that is held by only a tiny minority may constitute original research. Jimbo Wales has said of this:
"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:When_to_cite,Wikipedia:When to cite,"The list of featured-article criteria calls for inline citations where appropriate. The English Wikipedia's Verifiability policy requires inline citations for quotations, whether using direct or indirect speech, and for material that is challenged or likely to be challenged. Editors are also advised to add in-text attribution whenever a source's words are copied or closely paraphrased. You can make clear which sources support your article using:
Material that is actually challenged by another editor requires a source or it may be removed; and anything likely to incur a reasonable challenge should be sourced to avoid disputes and to aid readers (see WP:BURDEN). In practice, this means that most material is backed by an inline citation. In case of multiple possible references for a statement, the best reliable sources should be used.
Because the lead will usually repeat information also in the body, editors should balance the desire to avoid redundant citations in the lead with the desire to aid readers in locating sources. Leads are usually written at a greater level of generality than the body, and information in the lead section of non-controversial subjects is less likely to be challenged and less likely to require a source. There is not, however, an exception to citation requirements specific to leads. Complex, current, or controversial subjects may require many citations; others, few or none. Contentious material about living persons must always be cited, regardless of the level of generality.
The distance between material and its source is a matter of editorial judgment. The source of the material should always be clear, and editors should exercise caution when rearranging cited material to ensure that the text–source relationship isn't broken.
If you write a multi-sentence paragraph that draws on material from one source, the source need not be cited after every single sentence unless the material is particularly contentious. When multiple sources are used within a paragraph, these can be bundled into a single footnote if desired, so long as the footnote makes clear which source supports which points in the text.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Project_namespace#Content,Wikipedia:Project namespace,"
The project namespace or Wikipedia namespace is a namespace consisting of administration pages with information or discussion about Wikipedia. Pages in this namespace will always have the prefix Wikipedia:. They can also be reached by alias WP: or the standard (for any MediaWiki site) prefix Project:. Its namespace number is four (4).
Pages within the ""Project namespace"" themselves are not part of the encyclopedia proper. These administrative pages are intended for use by editors or by automated tools for the organization and governance of the encyclopedia. Consequently, they do not generally need to conform to the same content protocols or  style conventions as articles. Nevertheless, these pages, as with all pages, should be accessible and must comply with Wikipedia's conduct and legal policies.
The project namespace is not a free web host and should not be used as a long-term archive to host pages that look like articles. Articles in the project namespace under construction may be moved to the draft namespace or userspace draft allowing time for their development and feedback before being moved to Wikipedia's mainspace. Stalled or abandoned drafts and pages in the project namespace that violate policies applicable to non-content pages may be subject to deletion. Editors may not violate copyrights or harass anywhere on Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, these types of pages are subject to expeditious deletion. See below for more information.

The project namespace pages are organized according to their function within the overall project schema. This includes Wikipedia official policies and guidelines, process pages, discussion pages, optional essays, maintenance pages, informative pages, and historical pages. 
For lists of pages in the project namespace, see:
A main gateway for the project namespace is Community portal. The Community Portal includes categorized links to the more commonly used pages related to the project. A link to the Community Portal page is available in the sidebar.
Policies and guidelines  pages describe Wikipedia's best practice and clarify principles that are widely accepted by the community and have been through the Wikipedia review process. These pages are marked with the {{policy}}, {{guideline}} or {{MoS guideline}} template. For summaries of key policies, see  List of policies. For summaries of key guidelines, see List of guidelines. For summaries of guidelines about Wikipedia's house style, see the Manual of Style contents page. For information on editing policies or guidelines see Edits to policies and guidelines.
Process pages help facilitate application of the policies and guidelines governing all Wikipedia pages (e.g., Wikipedia:Articles for deletion). See Wikipedia processes for details.
Many pages in the Wikipedia namespace have nothing to do with rules or implementation of those rules, and thus do not belong in the above categories. See Wikipedia:The difference between policies, guidelines and essays for more information.
Some pages are designed for discussions, such as the Village pumps. Others serve as noticeboards to draw attention to discussions taking place elsewhere, such as the centralized discussions page and various requests for comments pages. While many of these pages operate like talk pages, some of them have posting rules (at the top of the page) which may be administratively enforced, and they also have their own talk pages, usually about the management of the noticeboard or other process in question. To ask a question or make a request, see the request directory. For a listing of ongoing discussions and current requests, see the dashboard. 
Maintenance pages are used to help facilitate the organization and clean-up of articles to bring them up to encyclopedic standards. These editor- and bot-generated pages typically contain articles and other pages requiring maintenance or attention. (e.g., Wikipedia:Dusty articles). The Special namespace also contains bot generated maintenance reports (e.g. Special:UncategorizedPages). See Wikipedia maintenance for details.
Informative and instructional pages are typically edited by the community; while not policies or guidelines themselves, they are intended to supplement or clarify Wikipedia guidelines, policies, or other Wikipedia processes and practices that are communal norms. Where essay pages offer advice or opinions through viewpoints, information pages should supplement or clarify technical or factual information about Wikipedia impartially. In comparison to policies and guidelines, information pages, like essay pages, have a limited status, and can reflect varying levels of consensus and vetting. These pages are typically marked with the {{Information page}}, {{Wikipedia how-to}}, or {{Supplement}}[a] template.
There is a large amount of overlap between the Help namespace (which provides mainly technical information) and the Wikipedia namespace (which provides mainly procedural information and interpretation). For this reason, redirects and hatnotes are often set up between these two namespaces. See Help:About help pages for more information. For a listing of how-to and information pages, see the help directory.
Essays about Wikipedia may be written by anyone; some represent widespread norms, others only represent minority viewpoints. Essays can be long monologues or short theses, serious or funny, informative or opinionated. Essays, like information pages, have no official status, and do not speak for the Wikipedia community as they may be created and edited without overall community oversight. Essays are typically marked with one of the various essay templates. See Wikipedia:Essays for more information. For a listing of essays, see the essay directory.
Pages of a WikiProject are the central place for editor collaboration and organization on a particular topic area. Many  WikiProjects compose ""advice essays"" about how to apply Wikipedia's policies and guidelines  to their specific subject area. Pages with Wikipedia:WikiProject prefix form a WikiProject pseudo-namespace. These pages are typically marked with the {{WikiProject status}} or {{WikiProject advice}} template. For a listing of projects, see the directory of WikiProjects. For additional resources, or if you have any questions, please visit the WikiProject Council. 
A historical page or process is one which is no longer in use, or is no longer relevant or consensus has changed about its content. They are kept as records of past Wikipedia processes to give context to historical discussions and to inform future discussions on similar topics. These pages are typically marked with the {{historical}}, {{superseded}} or {{dormant}} templates. See HISTORICAL for more details.
Essays and information pages may be established by writing them and adding {{Essay}}, {{Information page}}, {{Wikipedia how-to}}, or similar templates to the page. Essays and information pages in the ""Wikipedia namespace"" should not be used to create an alternative rule set. Creation of new guideline and policy pages require discussion and a high level of consensus from the entire community before publication (see WP:PROPOSAL for procedural details). For general recommendations about the creation and improvement of existing guideline and policy pages, see Wikipedia:Policy writing is hard.
The project namespace contains many pages and a lot of information. Try to avoid creating new pages unnecessarily. Before creating a new page, you should consider looking through the topical index, essay directory and help directory to see if the material belongs at a page that already exists. It is strongly recommended that you propose a WikiProject at the proposal page, if there are enough willing editors to participate in the project. Already existing WikiProjects can be found in the directory of WikiProjects.
If editing can improve the page, this should be done rather than deleting the page. Disputes over page content are usually not dealt with by deleting the page, except in severe cases. The content issues should be discussed at the relevant talk page, and other methods of dispute resolution should be used first, such as listing on ""requests for comments"" for further input. If a project page clearly satisfies a ""general"" speedy deletion criterion, it should be tagged  with the appropriate template. 
The usual deletion process is to post a request at miscellany for deletion to have project pages deleted. Make sure that a notice of the request is posted to the talk page of the affected project. If the project is under a parent WikiProject, a notice should be posted there as well. 
Essays, information pages, and other informal pages that are only supported by a small minority of the community may be moved to the primary author's userspace over deletion. The Wikipedia community has historically tolerated a wide range of Wikipedia related subjects and viewpoints on user pages.
It is generally preferable that inactive WikiProjects not be deleted, but instead be marked as {{WikiProject status|inactive}}, or redirected to a relevant WikiProject, or changed to a task force of a parent WikiProject, unless the WikiProject was incompletely created or is entirely undesirable. See WP:INACTIVEWP for more details. 
Policies, guidelines and process pages should not be nominated for deletion, as such nominations will probably be considered disruptive, and the ensuing discussions closed early. The {{Disputed tag}} template is typically used for claims that an essay, WikiProject advice or information page was recently assigned guideline or policy status without proper or sufficient consensus being established. See WP:Local consensus for more details.
If the entire project page is a copyright violation, nominate it for G12 speedy deletion with {{db-copyvio|url=link to the source text}}. For issues only affecting specific revisions on a page (where other page versions are fine), revision delete is usually more appropriate. To request revision-deletion for copyright violations, see {{Copyvio-revdel}} for details.
The Wikipedia namespace began after the January 2002 release of the Phase II software. Prior to that, an index of related pages was maintained at Wikipedia utilities, which remained for some time afterwards at Wikipedia:Utilities. This list of pages in the project namespace has been replaced by the pages as described above.
By default, Wikipedia's search engine  looks in the Article namespace. To search in the Wikipedia namespace, you would type the project page prefix Wikipedia: (Wikipedia followed by a colon) or   WP: (WP followed by a colon), followed by some text identifying or relating to the search target. You can also use the Special:Search box below to locate Wikipedia/Project namespace pages. See Help:Searching for more information.
See Wikipedia:Template messages/Wikipedia namespace for a listing of Wikipedia namespace banners.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style,Wikipedia:Manual of Style,"
This Manual of Style (MoS or MOS) is the style manual for all English Wikipedia articles.[a] This primary page is supported by further detailed subpages, which may be cross-referenced here and are listed at Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Contents. If any contradiction arises, this page has precedence.[b]
Editors should write articles using straightforward, succinct, and easily understood language. Editors should structure articles with consistent, reader-friendly layouts and formatting (which are detailed in this guide).
Where more than one style or format is acceptable under the MoS, one should be used consistently within an article and should not be changed without good reason. Edit warring over stylistic choices is unacceptable.[c]
New content added to this page should directly address a persistently recurring style issue.
Sometimes the MoS provides more than one acceptable style or gives no specific guidance. When either of two styles is acceptable it is generally considered inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change.[d]
Edit warring over style, or enforcing optional style in a bot-like fashion without prior consensus, is disruptive and is never acceptable.[c][e]
Unjustified changes from one acceptable, consistently applied style in an article to a different style may generally be reverted. Seek opportunities for commonality to avoid disputes over style.
If you believe an alternative style would be more appropriate for a particular article, seek consensus by discussing this at the article's talk page or – if it raises an issue of more general application or with the MoS itself – at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style. If a discussion does not result in consensus for the change at the article, continue to use the already-established style there. If discussion fails to reach a consensus regarding which of two or more competing styles to use at all, then default to the style that was used in the first post-stub version of the article in which one of the applicable styles appeared. (This fall-back position does not give unchallengeable primacy to that particular style during consensus discussion, nor give the editor who imposed that earliest style any more say in the discussion.)
For retention of an article's established national variety of English (and potential reasons to change it), see § National varieties of English.
A title should be a recognizable name or description of the topic, balancing the criteria of being natural, sufficiently precise, concise, and consistent with those of related articles.
For formatting guidance see the Wikipedia:Article titles § Article title format section, noting the following:
Subject both to the above and to Wikipedia:Article titles, the rest of the MoS, particularly § Punctuation, applies also to the title.
See also Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles of works, for cases where an article about a published work has a title that coincides with the work's title.
An article's content should begin with an introductory lead section – a concise summary of the article – which is never divided into sections (see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section). The remainder of the article is typically divided into sections.
Infoboxes, images, and other related content in the lead section must be right-aligned.
Certain standardized templates and wikitext that are not sections go at the very top of the article, before the content of the lead section, and in the following order:
In the Vector 2022 skin, the table of contents is separate from the article content. In some older skins, a navigable table of contents appears automatically just after the lead if an article has at least four section headings.
If the topic of a section is covered in more detail in a dedicated article (see Wikipedia:Summary style), insert {{main|Article name}} or {{further|Article name}} immediately under the section heading.
As explained in detail in Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout § Standard appendices and footers, several kinds of material (mostly optional) may appear after the main body of the article, in the following order:
Stand-alone list articles have some additional layout considerations.
Section headings should generally follow the guidance for article titles (above), and should be presented in sentence case (Funding of UNESCO projects in developing countries), not title case (Funding of UNESCO Projects in Developing Countries).[f]

The heading must be on its own line, with one blank line just before it; a blank line just after is optional and ignored (but do not use two blank lines, before or after, because that will add unwanted visible space).
For technical reasons, section headings should:
These technical restrictions are necessary to avoid technical complications and are not subject to override by local consensus.
As a matter of consistent style, section headings should:

Hidden comments referring to a section heading or a whole section are best placed in the line below the heading. They can also be placed within the same line as the heading, but in that case they must be inside the == == markup:[j]

Before changing a heading, consider whether you might be breaking existing links to it. If there are many links to the old title,[k] create an anchor with that title to ensure that these still work. Similarly, when linking to a section, leave an invisible comment at the heading of the target section, naming the linking articles, so that if the heading is later altered these can be easily fixed, or alternatively another anchor can be created if there are many.[k] For example:
which will be saved in the article as:

The advantage of using {{subst:Anchor}}, or simply inserting the <span> tags directly, is that when edits are made to the section in the future, the anchor will not be included in page history entries as part of the section name. When {{Anchor}} is used directly, that undesirable behavior does occur. Note: if electing to insert the span directly, do not abbreviate it by using a self-closing tag, as in , since in HTML5 that XML-style syntax is valid only for certain tags, such as <br/>.[1] See Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking § Avoiding broken section links for further discussion.
The guidance above for section headings, specifically sentence case, redundancy, images and questions, also applies to table headings (and of table columns and rows). However, table headings can incorporate citations and may begin with, or be, numbers. Unlike page headings, table headers do not automatically generate link anchors. Aside from sentence case in glossaries, the heading advice also applies to the term entries in description lists. If using template-structured glossaries, terms will automatically have link anchors, but will not otherwise. Citations for description-list content go in the {{term}} or {{defn}} element, as needed.
National varieties of English (for example, American English or British English) differ in vocabulary (elevator vs. lift ), spelling (center vs. centre), and occasionally grammar (see § Plurals, below). Articles such as English plurals and Comparison of American and British English provide information about such differences. All national varieties of Standard English are equally acceptable on English Wikipedia, which uses a formal, encyclopedic register or tone.
An article's date formatting (November 1, 2025 vs. 1 November 2025) is also related to national varieties of English – see MOS:DATEFORMAT and especially MOS:DATETIES and MOS:DATEVAR.
The conventions of a particular variety of Standard English should be followed consistently within a given article. Exceptions include:
For an international encyclopedia, using vocabulary common to all varieties of English is preferable.
For assistance with specific terms, see Comparison of American and British English § Vocabulary, and American and British English spelling differences; most dictionaries also indicate regional terms.
An article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation should use the standard (formal, not colloquial) English of that nation. For example:
For topics with strong ties to the Commonwealth of Nations, or multiple Commonwealth countries or other former British territories, use British spelling.
When an English variety's consistent usage has been established in an article, maintain it in the absence of consensus to the contrary. There is only very exceptionally (such as when a topic has strong national ties, or the change reduces ambiguity) a valid reason for changing from one acceptable option to another. When no English variety has been established and discussion does not resolve the issue, use the variety found in the first post-stub revision that introduced an identifiable variety. An exception to this is do not change the variety of English within a quotation.
The established variety in a given article is documented by placing the appropriate Use X English template on the article page. The appropriate variety of English template can also be placed on its talk page.
An article should not be edited or renamed simply to switch from one variety of English to another. {{subst:uw-engvar}} may be placed on an editor's talk page to explain this.
Wikipedia article titles and section headings use sentence case, not title case; see Wikipedia:Article titles and § Section headings. For capitalization of list items, see § Bulleted and numbered lists. Other points concerning capitalization are summarized below. Full information can be found at Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters. The central point is that Wikipedia does not capitalize something unless it is consistently capitalized in a substantial majority of independent, reliable sources.
Generally, do not capitalize the word the in mid-sentence: throughout the United Kingdom, not throughout The United Kingdom. Conventional exceptions include certain proper names (he visited The Hague) and most titles of creative works (Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings – but be aware that the might not be part of the title itself, e.g., Homer composed the Odyssey).
There are special considerations for band names, institution names, nicknames, titles of works, and trademarks.
The English-language titles of compositions (books and other print works, songs and other audio works, films and other visual media works, paintings and other artworks, etc.) are given in title case, in which every word is given an initial capital except for certain less important words (as detailed at Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters § Composition titles). The first and last words in an English-language title are always capitalized.
Capitalization in non-English language titles varies, even over time within the same language; generally, retain the style of the original for modern works, and follow the usage in current[l] English-language reliable sources for historical works. When written in the Latin alphabet, many of these items should also be in italics, or enclosed in quotation marks.
When using taxonomic (""scientific"") names, capitalize and italicize the genus: Berberis, Erithacus. (Supergenus and subgenus, when applicable, are treated the same way.) Italicize but do not capitalize taxonomic ranks at the level of species and below: Berberis darwinii, Erithacus rubecula superbus, Acacia coriacea subsp. sericophylla; no exception is made for proper names forming part of scientific names. Higher taxa (order, family, etc.) are capitalized in Latin (Carnivora, Felidae) but not in their English equivalents (carnivorans, felids); they are not italicized in either form, except for viruses, where all names accepted by the ICTV are italicized (Retroviridae).
Cultivar and cultivar group names of plants are not italicized, and are capitalized (including the word Group in the name); cultivar names appear within single quotes (Malus domestica 'Red Delicious'), while cultivar groups do not (Cynara cardunculus Scolymus Group).
English vernacular (""common"") names are given in lower case in article prose (plains zebra, mountain maple, and southwestern red-tailed hawk) and in sentence case at the start of sentences and in other places where the first letter of the first word is capitalized.[f] They are additionally capitalized where they contain proper names: Przewalski's horse, California condor, and fair-maid-of-France. This applies to species and subspecies, as in the previous examples, as well as to general names for groups or types of organism: bird of prey, oak, great apes, Bryde's whales, livestock guardian dog, poodle, Van cat, wolfdog. When the common name coincides with a scientific taxon, do not capitalize or italicize, except where addressing the organism taxonomically: A lynx is any of the four medium-sized wild cat species within the genus Lynx. Non-English vernacular names, when relevant to include, are handled like any other non-English terms: italicized as such, and capitalized only if the rules of the native language require it. Non-English names that have become English-assimilated are treated as English (ayahuasca, okapi).
Standardized breeds should generally retain the capitalization used in the breed standards.[n] Examples: German Shepherd, Russian White goat, Berlin Short-faced Tumbler. As with plant cultivars, this applies whether or not the included noun is a proper name, in contrast to how vernacular names of species are written. However, unlike cultivars, breeds are never put in single quotation marks, and their names are never part of a scientific name. A species term appended at the end for disambiguation (""cat"", ""hound"", ""horse"", ""swine"", etc.) should not be capitalized, unless it is a part of the breed name itself and is consistently presented that way in the breed standards (rare cases include Norwegian Forest Cat and American Quarter Horse).
Create redirects from alternative capitalization and spelling forms of article titles, and from alternative names, e.g., Adélie Penguin, Adelie penguin, Adelie Penguin and Pygoscelis adeliae should all redirect to Adélie penguin.
The words sun, earth, moon, and solar system do not take capitals in general use (The sun was over the mountain top; The tribal people thought of the whole earth as their home). They are capitalized when the entity is personified (Sol Invictus ('Unconquered Sun') was the Roman sun god) or when used as the name of a specific body in a scientific or astronomical context (The Moon orbits the Earth; but Io is a moon of Jupiter).
Names of planets, moons, asteroids, comets, stars, constellations, and galaxies are proper names, and therefore capitalized (The planet Mars is in the constellation Gemini, near the star Pollux). The first letter of every word in such a name is capitalized (Alpha Centauri and not Alpha centauri; Milky Way, not Milky way). Words such as comet and galaxy should be capitalized when they form part of a proper name, but not when they are used as a generic term (Halley's Comet is the most famous of the comets; the Andromeda Galaxy is a spiral galaxy).
Do not capitalize directions such as north or their related forms (We took the northern road) except when they are parts of proper names (Great North Road, Great Western Drive, South Pole).
Capitalize names of regions if they have attained proper-name status, including informal conventional names (Southern California; the Western Desert), and derived terms for people (e.g., a Southerner as someone from the Southern United States). Do not capitalize descriptive names for regions that have not attained the status of proper names, such as southern Poland.
Composite directions may or may not be hyphenated, depending on the variety of English adopted in the article. Southeast Asia and northwest are more common in American English; but South-East Asia and north-west in British English. In cases such as north–south dialogue and east–west orientation, use an en dash; see § En dashes: other uses.
Capitalize names of particular institutions (the founding of the University of Delhi; the history of Stanford University) but not generic words for institutions (the high school is near the university). Do not capitalize the at the start of an institution's name, regardless of the institution's preferred style. There are rare exceptions, when a leading The is represented by a T in the organization's acronym: The International Cat Association (TICA).
Treat political or geographic units similarly: The city has a population of 55,000; The two towns merged to become the City of Smithville. Do not mimic the style of local newspapers which refer to their municipality as the City or The City, except for the City of London in some circumstances.
This guidance extends to the output of institutions, companies, and other organizations. For example, the full name of legislation like Online Safety Act 2023 would be capitalized, but subsequent references to the act would not.
Ligatures should be used in languages in which they are standard (hence Moreau's last words were clin d'œil is preferable to Moreau's last words were clin d'oeil) but not in English (encyclopedia or encyclopaedia, not encyclopædia), except in proper names (Æthelstan, not Aethelstan).
Abbreviations are shortened forms of words or phrases. In strict analysis, they are distinct from contractions, which use an apostrophe (e.g., won't, see § Contractions), and initialisms. An initialism is formed from some or all of the initial letters of words in a phrase. Below, references to abbreviations should be taken to include acronyms, and the term acronym should also apply to initialisms.
When an abbreviation will be used in an article, introduce it using the full expression, and the abbreviation in parentheses:
Do not use capitals in the full version merely because capitals are used in the abbreviation: an early Local Area Network (LAN).
Except in special circumstances, common abbreviations (such as PhD, DNA, or USSR) need not be expanded even on first use.
Pluralize acronyms by adding -s or -es: Three CD-ROMs and two BIOSes were released. Do not use a greengrocer's apostrophe to form plurals: Three CD-ROM's and two BIOS's were released.
An abbreviation may or may not be terminated with a full point (also called a period or full stop). A consistent style should be maintained within an article. North American usage is typically to end all abbreviations with a period/point (Dr. Smith of 42 Drummond St.) but in common British and Australian usage, no period/point is used if the abbreviation (contraction) ends in the last letter of the unabbreviated form (Dr Smith of 42 Drummond St) unless confusion could result. This is also common practice in scientific writing. Regardless of punctuation, words that are abbreviated to more than one letter are spaced (op. cit. not op.cit. or opcit). There are some exceptions: PhD (see above) for ""Philosophiae Doctor""; BVetMed for ""Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine"". In most situations, Wikipedia uses no such punctuation inside acronyms and initialisms: GDP, not G.D.P.
US is a commonly used abbreviation for United States, although U.S. – with periods and without a space – remains common in North American publications, including in news journalism. Multiple American style guides, including The Chicago Manual of Style (since 2010), now deprecate U.S. and recommend US.
For commonality reasons, use US by default when abbreviating, but retain U.S. in American or Canadian English articles in which it is already established, unless there is a good reason to change it. Because use of periods for abbreviations and acronyms should be consistent within any given article, always use US in an article with other country abbreviations. In longer abbreviations that incorporate the country's initials (USN, USAF), never use periods. When the United States is mentioned with one or more other countries in the same sentence, US (or U.S.) may be too informal, especially at the first mention or as a noun instead of an adjective (France and the United States, not France and the US). Do not use the spaced U. S. or the archaic U.S. of A., except when quoting.
Do not use U.S.A. or USA except in a quotation, as part of a proper name (Team USA), or in certain technical and formal uses (e.g., the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3, FIFA, and IOC country codes).
To indicate approximately, the use of {{circa}}, showing as c., is preferred over circa, c., ca., or approx.

Avoid abbreviations when they might confuse the reader, interrupt the flow, or appear informal. For example:
Avoid devising new abbreviations, especially acronyms. For example, World Union of Billiards is good as a translation of Union Mondiale de Billard, but neither it nor the reduction WUB is used by the organization or by independent sources; use the original name and its official abbreviation, UMB.
If it is necessary to abbreviate in a tight space, such as a column header in a table, use widely recognized abbreviations. For example, for New Zealand gross national product, use NZ and GNP, with a link if the term has not already been written out in the article: NZ GNP. Do not make up initialisms such as NZGNP.
Either <abbr> or {{abbr}} can be used for abbreviations and acronyms: <abbr title=""World Health Organization"">WHO</abbr> or {{abbr|WHO|World Health Organization}} will generate WHO; hovering over the rendered text causes a tooltip of the long form to pop up.
In normal text and headings, use and instead of the ampersand (&): January 1 and 2, not January 1 & 2. But retain an ampersand when it is a legitimate part of the style of a proper noun, the title of a work, or a trademark, such as in Up & Down or AT&T. Elsewhere, ampersands may be used with consistency and discretion where space is extremely limited (e.g., tables and infoboxes). Quotations may be cautiously modified, especially for consistency where different editions are quoted, as modern editions of old texts routinely replace ampersands with and (just as they replace other disused glyphs, ligatures, and abbreviations). Another frequent permissible but not required use is in short bibliographic references to works by multiple authors, e.g.: <ref>Lubbers & Scheepers (2002); Van Hiel & Mervielde (2002); Swyngedouw & Giles (2007); Van Hiel (2012).</ref>.
Italics are used for emphasis, rather than boldface or capitals. But overuse diminishes its effect: consider rewriting instead.
Use <em>...</em> or {{em|...}} for emphasis. This allows user style sheets to handle emphasis in a customized way, and helps reusers and translators.[2]
Use italics for the titles of works (such as books, films, television series, named exhibitions, computer games, music albums, and artworks). The titles of articles, chapters, songs, episodes, storylines, research papers and other short works instead take double quotation marks.
Italics are not used for major religious works (the Bible, the Quran, the Talmud).
Many of these titles should also be in title case.
Use italics when mentioning a word or character (see Use–mention distinction) or a string of words up to one sentence (the term panning is derived from panorama; the most common letter in English is e). When a whole sentence is mentioned, double quotation marks may be used instead, with consistency (The preposition in She sat on the chair is on; or The preposition in ""She sat on the chair"" is ""on""). Quotation marks may also be used for shorter material to avoid confusion, such as when italics are already heavily used in the page for another purpose (e.g., for many non-English words and phrases). Mentioning (to discuss grammar, wording, punctuation, etc.) is different from quoting (in which something is usually expressed on behalf of a quoted source). Quotation is done with quotation marks, never italics, nor both at once (see § Quotations for details).
A closely related use of italics is when introducing or distinguishing terms: The natural numbers are the integers greater than 0.
Italics are indicated for non-English phrases and isolated non-English words that are not commonly used in everyday English. However, proper names (such as place names) in other languages are not usually italicized, nor are terms in non-Latin scripts. The {{lang}} template and its variants support all ISO 639 language codes, correctly identifying the language and automatically italicizing for you. Please use these templates rather than just manually italicizing non-English material. (See WP:Manual of Style/Accessibility § Other languages for more information.)
Use italics for the scientific names of plants, animals, and all other organisms except viruses at the genus level and below (italicize Panthera leo and Retroviridae, but not Felidae). The hybrid sign is not italicized (Rosa × damascena), nor is the ""connecting term"" required in three-part botanical names (Rosa gallica subsp. officinalis).
Do not put quotations in italics. Quotation marks (or block quoting) alone are sufficient and the correct ways to denote quotations. Italics should only be used if the quoted material would otherwise call for italics. (See below.)
Use italics within quotations to reproduce emphasis that exists in the source material or to indicate the use of non-English words. The emphasis is better done with {{em}}. If it is not clear that the source already included italics (or some other styling) for emphasis, or to indicate when emphasis was not used in the original text but was editorially added later, add the editorial note [emphasis in original] or [emphasis added], respectively, after the quotation.
Italicize only the elements of the sentence affected by the emphasis. Do not italicize surrounding punctuation.
Brief quotations of copyrighted text may be used to illustrate a point, establish context, or attribute a point of view or idea. While quotations are an indispensable part of Wikipedia, excessive use of them is incompatible with an encyclopedic writing style and may be copyright infringement, so most of the content should be in the editor's own words. Consider paraphrasing quotations into plain and concise text when appropriate (while being aware that close paraphrasing can still violate copyright). Do not put quotations in italics unless the material would be italicized for some other reason.
Per the verifiability policy, direct quotations must be accompanied by an inline citation from a reliable source that supports the material. This is especially important in articles that are about or contain material about living or recently deceased people (BLPs).

Quotations must be verifiably attributed, and the wording of the quoted text must be faithfully reproduced. This is referred to as the principle of minimal change. Where there is good reason to change the wording, square bracket the changed text; for example, ""Ocyrhoe told him his fate"" might be quoted as ""Ocyrhoe told [her father] his fate"". If there is a significant error in the original, follow it with {{sic}} (producing  [sic] ) to show that the error was not made by Wikipedia. (for example, ""his interview with the Dolly Llama  [sic]"")  However, insignificant spelling and typographic errors should simply be silently corrected (for example, correct basicly to basically). When applied to text that is linked, the syntax of the template may be adjusted to {{sic|nolink=y}} (producing  [sic] in the resulting linked text; for example in the link:  [sic] template).[o] For the sake of accuracy and indexing, the titles of referenced sources should not be corrected for spelling, but minor typographic adjustments (like changing curly quotes to straight) may be made silently. Inline citations in the quoted text, to sources not used in the Wikipedia article, should be silently removed.
Use ellipses to indicate omissions from quoted text. Legitimate omissions include extraneous, irrelevant, or parenthetical words, and unintelligible speech (umm and hmm), but do not omit text where doing so would remove important context or alter the meaning of the text. Vulgarities and obscenities should be shown exactly as they appear in the quoted source; Wikipedians should never bowdlerize words (G-d d--n it!), but if the text being quoted itself does so, copy the text verbatim and use {{sic}} to indicate that the text is quoted as shown in the source.
In direct quotations, retain dialectal and archaic spellings, including capitalization (but not archaic glyphs and ligatures, as detailed below in § Typographic conformity).
Quotation should be used, with attribution, to present emotive opinions that cannot be expressed in Wikipedia's own voice, but never to present cultural norms as simply opinional:
Concise opinions that are not overly emotive can often be reported with attribution instead of direct quotation. Use of quotation marks around simple descriptive terms can imply something doubtful regarding the material being quoted; sarcasm or weasel words such as supposedly or so-called, might be inferred.
A quotation is not a facsimile and, in most cases, it is not a requirement that the original formatting be preserved. Formatting and other purely typographical elements of quoted text[p] should be adapted to English Wikipedia's conventions without comment, provided that doing so will not change or obscure meaning or intent of the text. These are alterations which make no difference when the text is read aloud, for example:
See Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles § Typographic conformity for special considerations in normalizing the typography of titles of works.

However, national varieties should not be changed, as these may involve changes in vocabulary. For example, a quotation from a British source should retain British spelling, even in an article that otherwise uses American spelling. (See § Consistency within articles.)
Numbers also usually should not be reformatted.
Direct quotation should not be used to preserve the formatting preferred by an external publisher (especially when the material would otherwise be unchanged), as this tends to have the effect of scare-quoting:
Italics can be used to mark a particular usage as a term of art (a case of ""words as words""), especially when it is unfamiliar or should not be reworded by a non-expert:
When quoting a complete sentence, it is usually recommended to keep the first word capitalized. However, if the quoted passage has been integrated into the surrounding sentence (for example, with an introduction such as ""X said that""), the original capital letter may be lower-cased.
It is normally unnecessary to note changes in capitalization. However, for more precision, the altered letter may be put inside square brackets: ""The"" → ""[t]he"".
The reader must be able to determine the source of any quotation, at the very least via a footnote. The source must be named in article text if the quotation is an opinion (see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view § Attributing and specifying biased statements). When attributing a quotation, avoid characterizing it in a biased manner.
See § For a quotation within a quotation.
Be conservative when linking within quotations; link only to targets that correspond to the meaning clearly intended by the quote's author. Where possible, link from text outside of the quotation instead – either before it or soon after. (If quoting hypertext, add an editorial note, [link in original] or [link added], as appropriate, to avoid ambiguity as to whether the link was made by the original author.)
Format a long quotation (more than about forty words or a few hundred characters, or consisting of more than one paragraph, regardless of length) as a block quotation, using the {{blockquote}} template. The text presented in block quotations and quote boxes (see below) should not itself be enclosed in quotation marks (including large, ""decorative""-type quotation marks). Block quotations and quote boxes using a colored background are also discouraged.
Use {{blockquote}} and similar markup only for actual quotations; indentation for other purposes is done differently.
It is conventional to precede a block quotation with an introductory sentence (or sentence fragment) and append the source citation to that line. Alternatively, the {{blockquote}} template provides parameters for attribution and citation which will appear below the quotation. (For use of dashes with attributions, see § Other uses for em dashes.) This below-quotation attribution style is intended for famous quotations and is unusual in articles because it may strike an inappropriate tone. A quotation with no cited source should be flagged with {{quote without source}}, or deleted.
Since line breaks and indentation are generally ignored inside {{blockquote}} or <blockquote>, use <poem> or {{poem quote}} for poetry, lyrics, and similar material. Such material can also be quoted inline, with line breaks indicated by {{nbsp}}/, and paragraph or stanza breaks by {{nbsp}}//. For example:
""And, as in uffish thought he stood, /
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, /
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, /
And burbled as it came! //
One, two! One, two! And through and through /
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!""

A {{Quote box}} is an alternative to an inline quote or a block quote. Quote boxes are displayed in a stand-alone manner (similar to images) and are best suited to noteworthy or important quotations. They can create  point of view or undue weight issues, because the quotations are not integrated into the text of the article proper and put in context. They must therefore be used with particular care.
Pull quotes do not belong in Wikipedia articles. These are the news and magazine style of ""pulling"" material already in the article to reuse it in attention-grabbing decorative quotations. This unencyclopedic approach is a form of editorializing, produces out-of-context and undue emphasis, and may lead the reader to conclusions not supported in the material.
Excessive quotation of copyrighted text (whether or not formatted as a blockquote, and even if credited to its source) is prohibited. See WP:COPYQUOTE.
Quotations from non-English language sources should appear with a translation into English, preferably a modern[l] one. Quotations that are translations should be explicitly distinguished from those that are not. Indicate the original source of a translation (if it is available, and not first published within Wikipedia), and the original language (if that is not clear from the context).
If the original, untranslated text is available, provide a reference for it or include it, as appropriate.
When editors themselves translate text into English,[q] care must always be taken to include the original text, in italics (except for non-Latin-based writing systems, and best done with the {{lang}} or {{langx}} templates which both italicize as appropriate and provide language metadata); and to use actual and (if at all possible) common English words in the translation. Unless you are certain of your competency to translate something, see Wikipedia:Translation for assistance.
In the material below, the term quotation includes conventional uses of quotation marks such as for titles of songs, chapters, episodes, and so on. Quotation marks are also used in other contexts, such as in cultivar names.
Most quotations take double quotation marks (Bob said: ""Jim ate the apple."").[r]
Exceptions:
Use single quotes:
For deeper nesting, alternate between single and double quotes:
For quote marks in immediate succession, add a sliver of space by using {{"" '}}, {{' ""}}, or (as in the example just given) {{"" ' ""}}:
In the bolded text typically appearing at the opening of an article:
If a non-quoted but otherwise identical construction would work grammatically without a comma, using a comma before a quotation embedded within a sentence is optional:
The comma-free approach is often used with partial quotations:
A comma is required when it would be present in the same construction if none of the material were a quotation:
Do not insert a comma if it would confuse or alter the meaning:
It is clearer to use a colon to introduce a quotation if it forms a complete sentence, and this should always be done for multi-sentence quotations:
No additional punctuation is necessary for an explicit words-as-words scenario:
Quotation marks should be used for the following names and titles:
Correct: The Beatles wrote ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" for their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
Do not use quotation marks or italics for:
Many, but not all, of the above items should also be in title case.
Use the logical quotation style in all articles, regardless of the variety of English in which they are written. Include terminal punctuation within the quotation marks only if it was present in the original material, and otherwise place it after the closing quotation mark. For the most part, this means treating periods and commas in the same way as question marks: keep them inside the quotation marks if they apply only to the quoted material and outside if they apply to the whole sentence. Examples are given below.
If the quotation is a single word or a sentence fragment, place the terminal punctuation outside the closing quotation mark. When quoting a full sentence, the end of which coincides with the end of the sentence containing it, place terminal punctuation inside the closing quotation mark.
If the quoted sentence is followed by a clause that should be preceded by a comma, omit the full stop (period), and do not replace it with a comma inside the quotation.[t] Other terminal punctuation, such as question marks or exclamation marks, may be retained.
If the quoted sentence is followed by a clause identifying the speaker, use a comma outside the quotation mark instead of a full stop inside it, but retain any other terminal punctuation, such as a question mark.
Do not follow quoted words or fragments with commas inside the quotation marks, except where a longer quotation has been broken up and the comma is part of the full quotation.
External links to article titles should have the title in quotes inside the link. The CS1 and CS2 citation templates do this automatically, and untemplated references should do the same.
Internal links (wikilinks) accompanied by quotation marks should usually have the quotes outside the link. This applies to titles of works in quotation marks (songs, episodes, etc.)
However, quotation marks are needed inside wikilinks when the quotation mark is part of the link, or where the linked display text includes quotation marks indicating slang, nicknames, common names, or similar usage.
This section applies to both round brackets ( ), often called parentheses, and square brackets [ ].
If a sentence contains a bracketed phrase, place the sentence punctuation outside the brackets (as shown here). However, where one or more sentences are wholly inside brackets, place their punctuation inside the brackets. There should be no space next to the inner side of a bracket. An opening bracket should usually be preceded by a space. This may not be the case if it is preceded by an opening quotation mark, another opening bracket, or a portion of a word:
There should be a space after a closing bracket, except where a punctuation mark follows (though a spaced dash would still be spaced after a closing bracket) and in unusual cases similar to those listed for opening brackets.
Avoid adjacent sets of brackets. Either put the parenthetical phrases in one set separated by semicolons, or rewrite:
Square brackets are used to indicate editorial replacements and insertions within quotations, though this should never alter the intended meaning. They serve three main purposes:

If a sentence includes subsidiary material enclosed in square or round brackets, it must still carry terminal punctuation after those brackets, regardless of any punctuation within the brackets.  However, if the entire sentence is within brackets, the closing punctuation falls within the brackets. (This sentence is an example.)
Square brackets inside of links must be escaped:
He said, ""John [Doe] answered.""
He said, ""John [Doe] answered.""
On the first day [etc.]
On the first day [etc.]
The <nowiki> markup can also be used: <nowiki>[Doe]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[etc.]</nowiki>.
If a URL itself contains square brackets, the wiki-text should use the URL-encoded form https://example.com/foo.php?query=%5Bxxx%5Dyyy, rather than ...query=[xxx]yyy. This will avoid truncation of the link after xxx.
Use an ellipsis (plural ellipses) if material is omitted in the course of a quotation, unless square brackets are used to gloss the quotation (see § Brackets and parentheses, and the points below).
A pair of commas can bracket an appositive, relative clause, or parenthetical phrase (as can brackets or dashes, though with greater interruption of the sentence). For example:
Always use a pair of commas for this, unless another punctuation mark takes the place of the second comma:
Don't let other punctuation distract you from the need for a comma, especially when the comma collides with a bracket or parenthesis:

In geographical references that include multiple levels of subordinate divisions (e.g. city, state/province, country), a comma separates each element and follows the last element unless followed by terminal punctuation or a closing parenthesis. The last element is treated as parenthetical.
Also include commas when the geographical element is used as a disambiguator:
Include a second comma also when a construction with a comma modifies a noun or compound noun:

Dates in month–day–year format require a comma after the day, as well as after the year, unless followed by other punctuation. The last element is treated as parenthetical.

Place quotation marks by following § Punctuation inside or outside. This is known as ""logical quotation"".
A comma may be included before a quotation embedded within a sentence (see § Quotation marks).
A serial comma (sometimes also known as an Oxford comma or Harvard comma) is a comma used immediately before a conjunction (and, or, nor) in a list of three or more items.
Editors may use either convention so long as each article is internally consistent. Serial commas are more helpful when article text is complex, such as a list with multi-word items (especially if one contains its own ""and"") or a series of probably unfamiliar terms.
However, there are cases in which either omitting or including the serial comma results in ambiguity:
In such cases of ambiguity, clarify one of four ways:
A colon (:) introduces something that demonstrates, explains, or modifies what has come before, or is a list of items that has just been introduced. The items in such a list may be separated by commas, or if they are more complex and perhaps themselves contain commas, the items should be separated by semicolons or arranged in a bulleted list.
A colon may also be used to introduce direct speech enclosed within quotation marks. (See § Quotation marks.)
In most cases, a colon works best with a complete grammatical sentence before it. When what follows the colon is also a complete sentence, start it with a capital letter, but otherwise do not capitalize after a colon except where doing so is needed for another reason, such as for a proper name. When a colon is being used as a separator in an article title, section heading, or list item, editors may choose whether to capitalize what follows, taking into consideration the existing practice and consistency with related articles.
Except in technical usage (a 3:1 ratio), no sentence should contain multiple colons, no space should precede a colon, and a space (but never a hyphen or dash) should follow the colon.
A semicolon (;) is sometimes an alternative to a full stop (period), enabling related material to be kept in the same sentence; it marks a more decisive division in a sentence than a comma. If the semicolon separates clauses, normally each clause must be independent (meaning that it could stand on its own as a sentence). In many cases, only a comma or only a semicolon will be correct in a given sentence.
Above, ""Though he had been here before"" cannot stand on its own as a sentence, and therefore is not an independent clause.
This incorrect use of a comma between two independent clauses is known as a comma splice; however, in certain kinds of cases, a comma may be used where a semicolon would seem to be called for:
A sentence may contain several semicolons, especially when the clauses are parallel in construction and meaning; multiple unrelated semicolons are often signs that the sentence should be divided into shorter sentences or otherwise refashioned.
Semicolons are used in addition to commas to separate items in a listing, when commas alone would result in confusion.
The meaning of a sentence containing a trailing clause that starts with the word however depends on the punctuation preceding that word. A common error is to use the wrong punctuation, thereby changing the meaning to one not intended.
When the word however is an adverb meaning ""nevertheless"", it should be preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma. Example:
When the word however is a conjunction meaning ""in whatever manner"", or ""regardless of how"", it may be preceded by a comma but not by a semicolon, and should not be followed by punctuation. Example:
In the first case, the clause that starts with ""however"" cannot be swapped with the first clause; in the second case this can be done without change of meaning:
If the two clauses cannot be swapped, a semicolon is required.
A sentence or clause can also contain the word however in the middle, if it is an adverb meaning ""although"" that could have been placed at the beginning but does not start a new clause in mid-sentence. In this use, the word may be enclosed between commas. Example:
Hyphens (-) indicate conjunction. There are three main uses:
Multi-word hyphenated items: It is often possible to avoid multi-word hyphenated modifiers by rewording (a four-CD soundtrack album may be easier to read as a soundtrack album of four CDs). This is particularly important where converted units are involved (the 6-hectare-limit (14.8-acre-limit) rule might be possible as the rule imposing a limit of six hectares (14.8 acres), and the ungainly 4.9-mile (7.9 km) -long tributary as simply 4.9-mile (7.9 km) tributary).
For optional hyphenation of compound points of the compass such as southwest/south-west, see § Compass points.
Do not use a capital letter after a hyphen except for a proper name following the hyphen: Graeco-Roman and Mediterranean-style, but not Gandhi-Like. In titles of published works, when given in title case, follow the capitalization rule for each part independently (The Out-of-Towners), unless reliable sources consistently do otherwise in a particular case (The History of Middle-earth).
Hyphenation rules in other languages may be different. Thus, in French a place name such as Trois-Rivières ('Three Rivers') is hyphenated, when it would not be in English. Follow reliable sources in such cases.
Spacing: A hyphen is never followed or preceded by a space, except when hanging (see above) or when used to display parts of words independently, such as the prefix sub- and the suffix ‑less.
Image filenames and redirects: Image filenames are not part of the encyclopedic content; they are tools. They are most useful if they can be readily typed, so they usually use hyphens instead of dashes. Similarly, article titles with dashes should also have a corresponding redirect from a copy of the title with hyphens: for example, Michelson-Morley experiment redirects to Michelson–Morley experiment.
Non-breaking: A non-breaking hyphen ({{nbhyph}}) will not be used as a point of line-wrap.

Soft hyphens: Use soft hyphens to mark locations where a word will be broken and hyphenated if necessary at the end of a line of text, usually in very long words or narrow spaces (such as captions, narrow table columns, or text adjacent to a very wide image), for example: {{shy|Penn|syl|va|nia and Mass|a|chu|setts style themselves com|mon|wealths.}}. Use sparingly to avoid making wikitext difficult to read and edit. For more information, see Help:Line-break handling.
Encoding: The hyphen is represented by the ASCII/UNICODE HYPHEN-MINUS character, which is entered by the hyphen or minus key on all standard keyboards. Do not use the UNICODE HYPHEN character.
Two forms of dash are used on Wikipedia: en dash (–) and em dash (—). To enter them, click on them in the CharInsert toolbar, or on a Windows keyboard enter them manually as:
On a Mac keyboard the en dash is entered as ⌥ Opt+-, and the em dash as ⇧ Shift+⌥ Opt+-. 
Do not use a double hyphen (--) to stand in for a dash. (See also: Wikipedia:How to make dashes.)
Sources use dashes in varying ways. For consistency and clarity, Wikipedia adopts the following principles.
Dashes are often used to mark divisions within a sentence: in pairs (parenthetical dashes, instead of parentheses or pairs of commas) or singly (perhaps instead of a colon). They may also indicate an abrupt stop or interruption in reporting quoted speech. In all such cases, either unspaced em dashes or spaced en dashes can be used, with consistency maintained throughout a given article:
Ideally, an en dash should be preceded by a non-breaking space; this prevents the dash from appearing at the beginning of a line. The {{snd}} template may be used for this:
Do not insert any spaces where an en dash should be unspaced (see § Other uses for en dashes).
Dashes can clarify a sentence's structure when commas, parentheses, or both are also being used.

Use dashes sparingly. More than two in a single sentence makes the structure unclear; it takes time for the reader to see which dashes form a pair, if any.
For ranges between numbers, dates, or times, use an en dash:
Do not change hyphens to dashes in filenames, URLs, or templates such as {{Bibleverse}} (which formats verse ranges into URLs), even if a range is embedded in them.
Do not mix en dashes with between or from.
The en dash in a range is always unspaced, except when either or both elements of the range include at least one space, hyphen, or en dash; in such cases, {{snd}} between them will provide the proper formatting.
If negative values are involved, an unspaced en dash might be confusing:
Here, the relationship is thought of as parallel, symmetric, equal, oppositional, or at least involving separate or independent elements. The components may be nouns, adjectives, verbs, or any other independent part of speech. Often, if the components are reversed there would be little change of meaning.
Generally, use a hyphen in compounded proper names of single entities.

Use an en dash between the names of nations or nationalities when referring to an association between them. For people and things identifying with multiple nationalities, use a hyphen when using the combination adjectivally and a space when they are used as nouns, with the first used attributively to modify the second.
A slash or some other alternative may occasionally be better to express a ratio, especially in technical contexts (see § Slashes).
Use an en dash for the names of two or more entities in an attributive compound.
Do not use an en dash for hyphenated personal names, even when they are used as adjectives:
Do not use spaces around the en dash in any of the compounds above.
When the compound itself includes a space:
A hyphen:
A dash:
The form of category names follows the corresponding main articles, e.g., Category:Trans–New Guinea languages. However, the principle is not extended when compounding other words in category names,[4] e.g., Category:Tennis-related lists and Category:Table tennis-related lists both use hyphens.
Spaced en dashes are sometimes used between parts of list items. For example:
or
Editors may choose whether to capitalize what follows, taking into consideration the existing practice and consistency with related articles.
The en dash (–) has several common functions beyond its use in lists and running text. It is used to join components less strongly than a hyphen would (see § Hyphens); conversely, it may also separate components less strongly than a slash would (see § Slashes). Consider the relationship that exists between two components when deciding what punctuation to place between them.
An indented em dash may be used when attributing the source of a passage, such as a block quotation or poem. This dash should not be fully spaced: however, for reasons related to metadata and accessibility, it is best to place a hair space between the dash and the name.[x] Most of Wikipedia's quotation templates provide this formatting automatically.
For example, {{in5}}—{{hair space}}Charlotte Brontë produces:
     — Charlotte Brontë
In article titles, do not use a hyphen (-) as a substitute for an en dash, for example in eye–hand span (since eye does not modify hand). Nonetheless, to aid searching and linking, provide a redirect with hyphens replacing the en dash(es), as in eye-hand span. Similarly, provide category redirects for categories containing dashes. When an en dash is being used as a separator in an article title or section heading, editors may choose whether to capitalize what follows, taking into consideration the existing practice and consistency with related articles.
Do not use typewriter approximations or other substitutes, such as two hyphens (--), for em or en dashes.
For a negative sign or subtraction operator use U+2212 − MINUS SIGN (&minus;), which can also be generated by clicking on the − following the ± in the Insert toolbar beneath the edit window. Do not use U+2212 − MINUS SIGN inside a <math> tag, as the character gives a syntax error; instead use a normal hyphen U+002D - HYPHEN-MINUS.
Generally, avoid joining two words with a slash (a.k.a. forward slash, stroke, or solidus), because it suggests that the words are related without specifying how. Replace with clearer wording. In circumstances involving a distinction or disjunction, the en dash (see above) is usually preferable to the slash: the digital–analog distinction.
For example: The parent/instructor must be present at all times.
An unspaced slash may be used:
A spaced slash may be used:
To avoid awkward linebreaks, code spaced slashes (and fraction slashes) with a non-breaking space on the left and a normal space on the right, as in: My mama told me&nbsp;/ You better shop around. For short constructions, both spaces should be non-breaking: x&nbsp;/&nbsp;y. On the other hand, if two long words are connected by an unspaced slash, a {{wbr}} added after the slash will allow a linebreak at that point.
Do not use the backslash character ( \ ) in place of a slash.
Prefer the division operator ( ÷ ) to slash or fraction slash when representing elementary arithmetic in general text: 10 ÷ 2 = 5. In more advanced mathematical formulas, a vinculum or slash is preferred: 







x

n



n
!






{\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}}

 or xn/n! (see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers § Common mathematical symbols and Help:Displaying a formula).
Avoid writing and/or unless other constructions would be lengthy or awkward. Instead of Most had trauma and/or smoke inhalation, write simply trauma or smoke inhalation (which would normally be interpreted as an inclusive or to imply or both); or, for emphasis or precision or both, write trauma or smoke inhalation or both. Where more than two possibilities are present, instead of x, y, and/or z write one or more of x, y, and z or some or all of x, y, and z.
Unicode symbols are preferred over composed ASCII symbols for improved readability and accessibility. Be mindful of presentations that may require ASCII, like sourcecode. Keys for these symbols can be found at the bottom of the Source Editor.
Avoid using the # symbol (known as the number sign, hash sign, pound sign, or octothorpe) when referring to numbers or rankings. Instead write number, No. or Nos.; do not use the symbol №. For example:
Exceptions:
When using the abbreviations, write {{abbr|Vol.|Volume}}, {{abbr|Iss.|Issue}}, {{abbr|No.|Number}}, or {{abbr|Nos.|Numbers}}, at first occurrence.
In normal text, never put a space before a comma, semicolon, colon, period/full stop, question mark, or exclamation mark (even in quoted material; see § Typographic conformity).
Some editors place two spaces after a period or full stop (see Sentence spacing); these are condensed to one space when the page is rendered, so it does not affect what readers see.
Where a word or phrase that includes terminal punctuation ends a sentence, do not add a second terminal punctuation mark. If a quoted phrase or title ends in a question mark or exclamation mark, it may confuse readers as to the nature of the article sentence containing it, and so is usually better reworded to be mid-sentence. Where such a word or phrase occurs mid-sentence, new terminal punctuation (usually a period) must be added at the end.
Reference tags (<ref>...</ref>) are used to create footnotes (also called endnotes or simply notes), as citation footnotes and sometimes explanatory notes. All reference tags should immediately follow the text to which the footnote applies, with no intervening space.[y] Apart from the exceptions listed below, references are placed after adjacent punctuation, not before. Adjacent reference tags should have no space between them, nor should there be any between tags and inline dispute and cleanup templates.
When reference tags are used, a footnote list must be added, and this is usually placed in the References section, near the end of the article in the standard appendices and footers.
Exceptions: Reference tags are placed before dashes, not after. If a footnote applies only to material within parentheses, the tags belong just before the closing parenthesis.
Sentences should place punctuation after mathematical formulae as if they were normal body text. See Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Mathematics § Punctuation after formulae.
Dates should be linked only when they are germane and topical to the subject, as discussed at Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking § Chronological items. For ranges of dates and times, see § Other uses for en dashes.
Times of day are normally expressed in figures rather than words. Context determines whether the 12- or the 24-hour format is more appropriate.
Full dates are formatted 10 June 1921 or June 10, 1921; or where the year is omitted, use 10 June or June 10.
More information on all the above topics can be found at Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers § Chronological items, including the handling of dates expressed in different calendars, and times corresponding to different time zones.
Terms such as ""current"", ""now"", and ""recent""[l] should be avoided. What is current today may not be tomorrow; situations change over time. Instead, use date- and time-specific text. To help keep information updated use {{As of}}, which will allow editors to catalog and update dated statements.
For the possessive of singular nouns, including proper names and words ending in s, add 's (my daughter's achievement, my niece's wedding, Cortez's men, the boss's office, Illinois's largest employer, the US's partners, Descartes's philosophy, Verreaux's eagle). Exception: abstract nouns ending with an /s/ sound when followed by sake (for goodness' sake, for his conscience' sake). If a name ending in s or z would be difficult to pronounce with 's added, consider rewording (Jesus's teachings becomes the teachings of Jesus).
For a normal plural noun ending with a pronounced s, form the possessive by adding just an apostrophe (my sons' wives, my nieces' toys). For a plural noun not ending with a pronounced s, add 's (women's careers, people's habits, mice's whiskers; The two Dumas's careers were controversial, but where rewording is an option, this may be better: The career of each Dumas was controversial).
Official names (of companies, organizations, or places) should not be altered. (St Thomas' Hospital should therefore not be rendered as St Thomas's Hospital or St. Thomas Hospital, even for consistency.)
A possessive construction must immediately be followed by what is possessed. For example:
To maintain an objective and impersonal encyclopedic voice, an article should never refer to its editors or readers using I, my, we, us, our, or similar words: We note that some believe that bats are bugs. But some of these words are acceptable in certain figurative uses. For example:
Avoid addressing the reader using you or your, which sets an inappropriate tone (see also § Instructional and presumptuous language).
Refer to a person with pronouns (and other gendered words) that reflect their latest self-identification in recent reliable sources. Singular they/them/their are appropriate in reference to anyone who uses those, as replacements for neopronouns, and in generic reference to persons of unknown gender. (For considerably more detail, see WP:Manual of Style/Biography § Gender identity.)
Ships (military or private-sector) may be referred to by either neuter pronouns (it, its) or feminine pronouns (she, her). Both usages are acceptable, but each article should be internally consistent and exclusively employ only one style.[aa] As with all optional styles, articles should not be changed from one style to another without clear and substantial reason.[ab] Try to avoid close, successive uses of the same referent for a ship, by using different referents in rotation; for example, it or she, the ship, and the ship's name. The she/her optional style does not apply to other vessel/vehicle types, such as trains.[ac] (See Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Military history § Pronouns.)
(See the next section, ""Plurals"", for singular it or plural they in reference to organizations and other collective nouns.)
Words adopted into English take the plurals shown in appropriate English dictionaries, otherwise we follow the pluralization conventions of the native language.
Some collective nouns – such as team (and proper names of them), army, company, crowd, fleet, government, majority, mess, number, pack, and party – may refer either to a single entity or to the members that compose it. In British English, such words are sometimes treated as singular, but more often treated as plural, according to context (but singular is not actually incorrect). In North American English, these words are almost invariably treated as singular; the major exception is that when a sports team is referred to by its short name, plural verbs are commonly used, e.g. the Heat are playing the Lakers tonight.
Names of towns and countries usually take singular verbs (even when grammatically plural: the United States is in North America, the Netherlands is also known as Holland), but exceptionally in British English, typically when used to refer to a sports team named after a town or country or when discussing actions of a government, plural is used. For example, in England are playing Germany tomorrow, England refers to a football team; but in England is in the Northern hemisphere, it refers to the country. See also § National varieties of English including § Opportunities for commonality.
By default, write articles in the present tense, including those covering works of fiction (see Wikipedia:Writing better articles § Tense in fiction) and products or works that have been discontinued. Generally, use past tense only for past events, and for subjects that are dead or no longer meaningfully exist, such as deceased people or defunct companies. Use past tense for articles about periodicals no longer produced, with common-sense exceptions.
Tense can be used to distinguish between current and former status of a subject: Dún Aonghasa is the ruin of a prehistoric Irish cliff fort. Its original shape was presumably oval or D-shaped, but parts of the cliff and fort have since collapsed into the sea. (Emphasis added to distinguish the different tense usages; Dún Aonghasa is a structure that was later damaged by an event.)
Always use present tense for verbs that describe genres, types, and classes, even if the subject of the description (e.g. program, library, device) no longer exists, is discontinued, is unsupported or is unmaintained. Present tense is also used for discontinued television shows.
Avoid contractions, which have little place in formal writing. For example, write do not instead of don't. Use of o'clock is an exception. Contracted titles such as Dr. and St generally should not be used but may apply in some contexts (e.g., quoted material, place names, titles of works).
Use gender-neutral language – avoiding the generic he, for example – if this can be done with clarity and precision. This does not apply to direct quotations or the titles of works (The Ascent of Man), which should not be altered, or to wording about one-gender contexts, such as an all-female school (When any student breaks that rule, she loses privileges).
References to space programs, past, present and future, should use gender-neutral phrasing: human spaceflight, robotic probe, astronaut, cosmonaut, uncrewed mission, crewed spacecraft, piloted, unpiloted, not manned or unmanned. Direct quotations and proper nouns that use gendered words should not be changed, like Manned Maneuvering Unit.
Avoid words and phrases that give the impression of straining for formality, that are unnecessarily regional, or that are not widely accepted. See List of commonly misused English words; see also § Identity.
Avoid phrases such as remember that and note that, which address readers directly in an unencyclopedic tone and lean toward instructional. They are a subtle form of Wikipedia self-reference, ""breaking the fourth wall"". Similarly, phrases such as of course, naturally, obviously, clearly, and actually make presumptions about readers' knowledge, may express a viewpoint, and may call into question the reason for including the information in the first place.
Do not tell readers that something is interesting, ironic, surprising, unexpected, amusing, coincidental, etc. Simply present sourced facts neutrally and let readers draw their own conclusions. Such constructions can usually just be deleted, leaving behind proper sentences with a more academic and less pushy tone: Note that this was naturally subject to controversy in more conservative newspapers. becomes This was subject to controversy in more conservative newspapers.
Similar variants which indirectly instruct readers, such as It should be noted that or It is important to note that, may be rewritten by leaving out those words: It is important to note that the colloquial dialect of Portuñol is similar to but different from Mirandese becomes just The colloquial dialect of Portuñol is similar to but different from Mirandese. 
Avoid rhetorical questions, especially in headings. Use a heading of Active listening and text such as The term active listening, coined in ..., not What is active listening?
For issues in the use of cross-references – e.g., (see also Bulverism) – see § Second-person pronouns.
A subset term identifies a set of members of a larger class. Common subset terms are including, among, and etc. Avoid redundant subset terms (e.g., mis-constructions like Among the most well-known members of the fraternity are included two members of the Onassis family or The elements in stars include hydrogen, helium, etc.). The word including does not introduce a complete list; instead, use consisting of, or composed of.
When there is a discrepancy between the term most commonly used by reliable sources for a person or group and the term that person or group uses for themselves, use the term that is most commonly used by recent[l] reliable sources. If it is unclear which is most used, use the term that the person or group uses.
Disputes over how to refer to a person or group are addressed by Wikipedia content policies, such as those on verifiability, and neutral point of view (and article titles when the term appears in the title of an article).
Use specific terminology. For example, it is often more appropriate for people or things from Ethiopia (a country in Africa) to be described as Ethiopian, not carelessly (with the risk of stereotyping) as African.
Specific guidelines apply to any person whose gender might be questioned, and any living transgender or non-binary person. In summary:
For examples and finer points, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography § Gender identity.
Non-English terms should be used sparingly. In general, use italics for phrases and words that are not current in English. This is best done with the {{lang}} template using the appropriate ISO language code, e.g., {{lang|es|casa}}. There are alternatives to the {{lang}} template which also provide additional information about a non-English word or phrase, such as a link to the language name; see Category:Wikipedia multilingual support templates. As Wikipedia does not apply italics to names of people, places, or organizations, the alternative template {{langr}} can be used to apply the language markup without italicizing.[ad] Templates like {{lang}} automatically italicize text written using the Latin alphabet, so specifying italics is unnecessary. 
Text written in non-Latin scripts such as Greek, Cyrillic, and Chinese should not be italicized or put in bold, as the difference in script is already sufficient to visually distinguish the text. Generally, any non-Latin text should be accompanied by an appropriate romanization.
Loanwords and borrowed phrases that have common usage in English – Gestapo, samurai, vice versa – do not require italics. A rule of thumb is to not italicize words that appear unitalicized in major general-purpose English dictionaries.
Names and terms originally written using a non-Latin script—such as the Greek alphabet, the Cyrillic alphabet, or Chinese characters—must be romanized for English-language use. If a particular romanization of the subject's name is most common in English (Tchaikovsky, Chiang Kai-shek), that form should be used. Otherwise, the romanization of names should adhere to a particular widely used system for the language in question (Aleksandr Tymoczko, Wang Yanhong). 
The use of diacritics in non-English words is neither encouraged nor discouraged. Use generally depends on whether they appear in reliable English-language sources, though with some additional constraints imposed by site guidelines. Provide redirects from alternative forms that include or exclude diacritics.
Proper names in languages written using the Latin alphabet can include letters with diacritics, ligatures, and other characters that are not commonly used in contemporary English. Wikipedia normally retains these special characters, except where there is a well-established English spelling that replaces them with English standard letters. Examples:
Use of diacritics is determined on a topic-by-topic basis; a small group of editors cannot prohibit or require the use of diacritics within a given class of articles.[ae]
Spell a name consistently in the title and the text of an article. (Relevant policy: Wikipedia:Article titles; see also Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English-language sources).) For a non-English name, phrase, or word, adopt the spelling most commonly used in English-language reliable sources, including but not limited to those already cited in the article.[af] For punctuation of compounded forms, see relevant guidelines in § Punctuation.
Proper names in non-English languages should generally not be italicized, unless another reason applies; such as with titles of major published works, e.g., Les Liaisons dangereuses; or when being compared to other names for the same subject in a words-as-words manner, e.g., Nuremberg (German: Nürnberg). When non-English text should not be italicized, it can still be properly tagged by using the {{lang}} template with the |italic=unset parameter: {{lang|de|Nürnberg|italic=unset}}.
Sometimes usage will be influenced by other guidelines, such as § National varieties of English, which may lead to different choices in different articles.
Some topics are necessarily technical; however, editors should seek to write articles accessible to the greatest possible number of readers. Minimize the use of jargon, and adequately explain its meaning when it is used. Overly technical material can be tagged with {{Technical}} or {{Technical statement}}, so that it can be addressed by other editors. For topics that require a more technical approach, the creation of a separate introductory article (like Introduction to general relativity) may be a solution.
Excessive wikilinking (linking within Wikipedia) can result from trying too hard to avoid putting explanations in parenthetical statements, like the one that appeared earlier in this sentence. Do not introduce specialized words solely to teach them to the reader when more widely understood alternatives will do. 
When the concepts underlying the jargon used in an article are too complex to explain concisely in a parenthetical, write one level down. For example, consider adding a brief background section with {{main}} tags pointing to articles with a fuller treatment of the prerequisite material. This approach is practical only when the prerequisite concepts are central to the exposition of the article's main topic and when such prerequisites are not too numerous. Short articles, such as stubs, generally do not have such sections.
For italicization and other markup of introduced terms, see: Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting § Words as words.
Geographical or place names are the nouns used to refer to specific places and geographic features. These names often give rise to conflict, because the same places are called different things by different peoples speaking different languages. Many place names have a historical context that should be preserved, but common sense should prevail. There can be few places that have not been parts of more than one culture or have had only one name. As proper nouns, all such place names (but not terms for types of places) have major words capitalized.
A place should generally be referred to consistently by the same name as in the title of its article (see Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)). An exception may be made when there is a widely accepted historical English name appropriate to the given context. In cases where such a historical name is used, it should be followed by the modern[l] name in round brackets (parentheses) on the first occurrence of the name in applicable sections of the article. As with linking, this should not be done to the detriment of style. On the other hand, it is probably better to provide such a variant too often than too rarely. If more than one historical name is applicable for a given context, the other names should be added after the modern English name, that is: ""<historical name> (<modern name>, <other historical names>)"".
This is an English-language encyclopedia, so established English names are preferred if they exist, and spellings in non-English alphabets should always be transcribed into the Roman alphabet. In general, other articles should refer to places by the names which are used in the articles on those places, according to the rules described at Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names). If a different name is appropriate in a given historical or other context, then that may be used instead, although it is normal to follow the first occurrence of such a name with the standard modern name in parentheses.
At the start of an article, provide notable equivalent names from other languages, including transcriptions where necessary: 
Names in languages with no particular present-day or historical ties to the place in question (English excepted, of course) should not be listed as alternatives.
Avoid anachronism. An article about Junípero Serra should say he lived in Alta Mexico, not in California, because the latter entity did not yet exist in Serra's time. The Romans invaded Gaul, not France, and Thabo Mbeki was the president of the Republic of South Africa, not of the Cape Colony. For clarity, consider also mentioning the current name of the area (for example, ""in what is now France""), especially if no English name exists for that area in the relevant historical period.
Textual information should always be transmitted as text, rather than in an image, so that it can be easily searched, selected, copied, and manipulated by readers. These tasks are generally difficult or impossible with text presented in an image: images are slower to download and generally cannot be searched or processed by screen readers used by the visually impaired. Any important textual information in an image should be provided somewhere as text, generally either in the image's caption or alt text. However, its presentation can also be adjusted using CSS.
For entering textual information as audio, see Wikipedia:WikiProject Spoken Wikipedia.
Media files should have captions, unless they are unambiguous depictions of the subject of the article or are ""self-captioning"" (such as reproductions of album or book covers). In biography articles, a caption is not necessary for a portrait of the subject pictured alone, but one might be used to give the year, the subject's age or name, or other circumstances of the portrait.
Make links only where they are relevant and helpful in the context. Excessive use of hyperlinks can be distracting and may slow the reader down. Redundant links (like the one in the tallest people on Earth) clutter the page and make future maintenance harder. High-value links that are worth pursuing should stand out clearly.
Linking to sections: A hash sign (#) followed by the appropriate heading will lead to a relevant part of a page. For example, [[Apostrophe#Use in non-English names]] links to a particular section of the article Apostrophe.
Initial capitalization: Wikipedia's MediaWiki software does not require that wikilinks begin with an upper-case character. Capitalize the first letter only where this is naturally called for, or when specifically referring to the linked article by its name (see also related rule for italics in cross-references): Snakes are often venomous, but lizards only rarely (see Poison).
Check links: Ensure the destination is the intended one; many dictionary words lead to disambiguation pages and not to complete or well-chosen articles.
External links should not normally be used in the body of an article. Instead, articles can include an External links section at the end, pointing to further information outside Wikipedia as distinct from citing sources. The standard format is a primary heading, == External links ==, followed by a bulleted list of links. Identify the link and briefly indicate its relevance to the article. For example:
These will appear as:
Where appropriate, use external link templates such as {{Official website}} and {{URL}}.
Add external links with discretion; Wikipedia is not a link repository.
Other things being equal, keep markup simple. This makes wikitext easier to understand and edit, and the results seen by the reader more predictable. Use HTML and CSS markup sparingly. See: KISS principle.
In general, wikitext formatting is considered easier to use than HTML and wikitext is preferred if there are equivalents; see Help:HTML in wikitext. Obsolete elements and attributes should be updated or removed. There are many templates that allow HTML markup to be used without putting it in articles directly, such as {{em}} (see MOS:EMPHASIS) and {{strong}} (see MOS:BOLD).
An HTML character entity is sometimes better than the equivalent Unicode character, which may be difficult to identify in edit mode; for example, &Alpha; is explicit whereas Α (the upper-case form of Greek α) may be misidentified as the Latin A.
Modifications in font size, blank space, and color (see § Color coding) are an issue for the Wikipedia site-wide style sheet and should be reserved for special cases only.
Typically, the use of custom font styles:
Specify font sizes relatively (for example with font-size: 85%) rather than absolutely (like font-size: 8pt). The resulting font size of any text should not drop below 85% of the page's default font size.
Do not use color alone to mark differences in text: they may be invisible to people with color blindness and useless in black-and-white printouts or displays.
Choose colors such as maroon and teal that are distinguishable by readers with the most common form of colorblindness, and additionally mark the differences with change of font or some other means (maroon and alternative font face, teal). Avoid low contrast between text and background colors. See also color coding.
Even for readers with unimpaired color vision, excessive background shading of table entries impedes readability and recognition of Wikilinks. Background color should be used only as a supplementary visual cue and should be subtle (consider using lighter, less-dominant pastel hues) rather than glaring.
Do not use quotation templates to indent non-quotations. Various templates are available for indentation, including {{block indent}} to indent an entire block and {{in5}} to indent inline.
Do not use : (description list markup) to indent text in articles, even though it is common on talk pages. It causes accessibility problems and outputs invalid HTML. See Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility § Indentation for alternatives.
To display a mathematical formula in its own indented paragraph, use <math display=""block"">...</math>. See Help:Displaying a formula#Block for more details.
It is sometimes desirable to force a text segment to appear entirely on a single line‍—‌that is, to prevent a line break (line wrap) from occurring anywhere within it.
It is desirable to prevent line breaks where breaking across lines might be confusing or awkward. For example:
Whether a non-breaking space is appropriate depends on context: whereas it is appropriate to use 12{{nbsp}}MB in prose, it may be counterproductive in a table (where an unattractive break may be acceptable to conserve precious horizontal space) and unnecessary in a short parameter value in an infobox (where a break would never occur anyway).
A line break may occur at a thin space (&thinsp;, or {{thinsp}}), which is sometimes used to correct too-close placement of adjacent characters. An undesirable line break may also occur at special characters such as in bit/s. To prevent these, consider using {{nobr}} e.g. {{nobr|100 Mbit/s}}.
Insert non-breaking and thin spaces as named character reference (&nbsp; or &thinsp;), or as templates that generate these ({{nbsp}}, {{thinsp}}), and never by entering them directly into the edit window from the keyboard – they are visually indistinguishable from regular spaces, and later editors will be unable to see what they are. Inside wikilinks, a construction such as [[World War&nbsp;II]] works but [[World War{{nbsp}}II]] doesn't.
Elements that can selectively display or hide content can interfere with the ability of readers to access said content. These mechanisms include scrolling lists, and templates like {{collapse}} that can be toggled between collapsed and uncollapsed states using a [hide / show] button. These mechanisms should not be used to conceal ""spoiler"" information. Templates should generally not be used to store relevant article text, as it interferes with editors' ability to find and edit it. Moreover, content in an article should not be collapsed by default. This applies equally to content in footnotes, tables, and embedded lists, image galleries, and image captions.
If such mechanisms are used, care must be taken to ensure the content remains accessible for all users, including those with limited CSS or JavaScript support. When collapsing is desired, it must be done using the collapsible parameter of relevant templates, or certain manually added CSS classes (see Help:Collapsing). Other methods of hiding content should not be used, as they may render content inaccessible to many users, such as those browsing Wikipedia with JavaScript disabled or using proxy services.
Collapsed or auto-collapsing cells or sections may be used with tables if they simply repeat information covered in the main text (or are purely supplementary, e.g., several past years of statistics in collapsed tables for comparison with a table of uncollapsed current stats). Auto-collapsing is often a feature of navboxes. A few infoboxes also use pre-collapsed sections for infrequently accessed details. If information in a list, infobox, or other non-navigational content seems extraneous or trivial enough to inspire pre-collapsing it, consider raising a discussion on the article (or template) talk page about whether it should be included at all. If the information is important and the concern is article density or length, consider dividing the article into more sections, integrating unnecessarily list-formatted information into the article prose, or splitting the article.
Editors use ""invisible"" comments – not shown in the rendered page seen by readers of the article, but visible when an editor opens the article for editing – to communicate with one another.
Invisible comments are useful for alerting other editors to issues such as common mistakes that regularly occur in the article, a section title being the target of an incoming link, or pointing to a discussion that established a consensus relating to the article. They should not be used to instruct other editors not to perform certain edits, as this could be perceived as expressing a form of ownership over an article. However, where existing local consensus is against making an edit, invisible comments may help draw an editor's attention to that consensus.
Do not add too many invisible comments, as they can clutter the wiki source for other editors. Ensure that your invisible comment does not change the formatting, for example by introducing unwanted white space in the rendered page.
Manually you can enclose the text you intend to be read only by editors between <!-- and -->. For example:
The VisualEditor toolbar (not the source editor toolbar) can also be used:
This will produce <!-- Invisible comment -->, or if text is selected it will nest the text between <!-- and -->.
Pronunciation in Wikipedia is indicated in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). In most situations, for ease of understanding by the majority of readers and across variants of the language, quite broad IPA transcriptions are best for English pronunciations. See Help:IPA/English and Help:IPA (general) for keys, and {{IPA}} for templates that link to these keys. For English pronunciations, pronunciation respellings may be used in addition to the IPA.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Broad-concept_article,Wikipedia:Broad-concept article,"A broad-concept article is an article that addresses a concept that may be difficult to write about because it is abstract, or because it covers the sometimes-amorphous relationship between a wide range of related concepts. Due to the difficulty of explaining this relationship (and the comparative ease of merely listing articles to which the title relates), editors often create disambiguation pages for such titles, even though there is an unambiguous meaning that can be discerned from the relationship between the listed topics.
However, if the primary meaning of a term proposed for disambiguation is a broad concept or type of thing that is capable of being described in an article, and a substantial portion of the links asserted to be ambiguous are instances or examples of that concept or type, then the page located at that title should be an article describing it, and not a disambiguation page. Where the primary topic of a term is a general topic that can be divided into subtopics, such as chronologically (e.g., History of France) or geographically (e.g., Rugby union in the British Isles), the unqualified title should contain an article about the general topic rather than a disambiguation page.
A disambiguation page should not be created just because it is difficult to write an article on a topic that is broad, vague, abstract, or highly conceptual. Where there are additional meanings that are not instances or examples of a ""Foo"" primary concept or type, those should be included on a ""Foo (disambiguation)"" page.
There are some common tests that can be used to determine whether an article can potentially be considered a broad concept article. One of these is the ""expert"" test: could a person reasonably represent themselves as an expert in [name of page], without having to be an expert in multiple fields of knowledge (i.e. without having degrees from different departments in a typical university)? For example, although there are many species of tuna that are called ""bluefin tuna"" an icthyologist could be an expert in ""bluefin tuna"" without needing to specify a particular species. Compare that to a person claiming to be a ""Mercury"" expert, or a ""battery"" expert. The expert on ""Mercury"" would need to have both Roman mythology and astronomy in their knowledge base, along with chemistry. The expert on ""battery"" would need both chemical engineering and legal training, as well as some history in the military and (depending how significant the subtopic was considered) baseball.
In writing articles on these subjects, it is useful to directly address the scope of the term, and the history of how the concept has developed. Each of the examples of the concept or type of thing should be included at some point in the article, possibly in a list, so that no information is lost from what would have been presented in the disambiguation page format. Consider using summary style to incorporate information about the subtopics into the main article.
Pages needing to be expanded to describe the concept may be tagged with {{Broad-concept article}}. This template automatically categorizes tagged disambiguation pages under Category:Disambiguation pages to be converted to broad concept articles. If the requested BCA is eventually created, the above template should be removed and the article should be manually categorized under Category:Broad-concept articles instead.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reader,Wikipedia:Reader,"A reader is someone who visits Wikipedia articles to read rather than edit the content. Editors, often referred to as Wikipedians if logged in, also read Wikipedia, of course, but other than reading they also edit the pages to help build the encyclopedia.
Wikipedia currently has 7,083,931 articles that are edited by 115,137 active editors. Since 2007, Wikipedia has been one of the ten most popular websites,[1] and the Main Page receives hundreds of millions of pageviews per month. In June 2012, it had 227 million pageviews.[2] Individual articles vary in popularity depending on the shifting Zeitgeist.
The majority of visitors are readers so it is important that pages and articles are optimised for this readership.
According to the 2011 readership survey, the average reader is 36 years old. About 44% of readers are female and 56% male.
About half of readers—and the overwhelming majority of readers in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and Japan—visit Wikipedia more than once a week.
Wikipedia can be divided into content and project pages, although not all pages fit neatly into this dichotomy. Some pages may belong to both types, and there is disagreement as to what does actually constitute content. Article pages are clearly part of the content of Wikipedia, as are categories that contain content articles.
The Help and Wikipedia namespaces are a mix of content and project pages, although the vast majority of Wikipedia namespace pages are used for the project itself. {{Reader-facing page}} may be used to tag talk pages that are intended for non-editing readers.
It is important to attract editors to help with the project, but this should not be done at the expense of readability. Virtually every page on Wikipedia has an associated ""Talk"" page for any related discussion, and this is one of the links where new editors can jump to the project side and become involved. There are other links from content to project: the Community portal link on the left-hand side of the pages can be used, and the maintenance and warning templates often contain links to the project side.

"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence,Wikipedia:Verifiability,"
In the English Wikipedia, verifiability means that people can check that facts or claims correspond to reliable sources. Wikipedia's content is determined by published information rather than editors' beliefs, experiences, or previously unpublished ideas or information. Even if you are sure something is true, it must have been previously published in a reliable source before you can add it.[a] If reliable sources disagree with each other, then maintain a neutral point of view and present what the various sources say, giving each side its due weight.
Each fact or claim in an article must be verifiable. Additionally, four types of information must be accompanied by an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] the material:
When material that needs an inline citation appears in two or more articles, an inline citation is needed in each.
Any material that needs an inline citation but does not have one may be removed. Please immediately remove contentious material about living people (or existing groups) that is unsourced or poorly sourced.
For how to write citations, see citing sources. Verifiability, no original research, and neutral point of view are Wikipedia's core content policies. They work together to determine content, so editors should understand the key points of all three. Articles must also comply with the copyright policy.
All content must be verifiable.  A fact or claim is ""verifiable"" if a reliable source that supports it could be cited, even if there is no citation for it in the article at the moment. The burden to demonstrate verifiability lies with the editor who adds or restores material, and it is satisfied by providing an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] the contribution.[c]
The cited source must clearly support the material as presented in the article. Cite the source clearly, ideally giving page number(s)—though sometimes a section, chapter, or other division may be appropriate instead; see Wikipedia:Citing sources for details of how to do this.
Facts or claims without an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] them may be removed. They should not be restored without an inline citation to a reliable source. 
Whether or how quickly material should be removed for lacking an inline citation to a reliable source depends on the material and the overall state of the article. Consider adding a citation needed tag as an interim step to removing unsourced material, to allow references to be added.[d] When tagging or removing material for lacking an inline citation, state your concern that it may not be possible to find a published reliable source, and the material therefore may not be verifiable.[e] If you think the material is verifiable, you are encouraged to provide an inline citation yourself before removing or tagging it.
Do not leave unsourced or poorly sourced material in an article if it might damage the reputation of living people or existing groups, and do not move it to the talk page. Be aware of how Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons also applies to groups.
A cited source on Wikipedia is often a specific portion of text (such as a short article or a page in a book). But when editors discuss sources (for example, to debate their appropriateness or reliability) they are usually talking about one or more related characteristics:
All four can affect reliability.
Base articles on reliable, independent, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Source material must be published, on Wikipedia meaning made available to the public in some form.[f] Unpublished material is not considered reliable. Use sources that directly support the material presented in an article and are appropriate to the claims made. The appropriateness of any source depends on the context. Be especially careful when sourcing content related to living people or medicine.
If available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources on topics such as history, medicine, and science.
Editors may also use material from reliable non-academic sources, particularly if it appears in respected mainstream publications. Other reliable sources include:
Editors may also use electronic media, subject to the same criteria (see details in Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources).
The best sources have a professional structure for checking or analyzing facts, legal issues, evidence, and arguments. The greater the degree of scrutiny given to these issues, the more reliable the source.
Some newspapers, magazines, and other news organizations host online pages or columns they call blogs. These may be acceptable sources if the writers are professionals, but use them with caution because blogs may not be subject to the news organization's normal fact-checking process.[g] If a news organization publishes an opinion piece in a blog, attribute the statement to the writer, e.g. ""Jane Smith wrote ..."" Never use the blog comments that are left by the readers as sources. For personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources, see § Self-published sources below.
To discuss the reliability of a specific source for a particular statement, consult Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard, which seeks to apply this policy to particular cases. For a guideline discussing the reliability of particular types of sources, see Wikipedia:Reliable sources. In case of conflict between this policy and the Wikipedia:Reliable sources guideline, or any other guideline related to sourcing, this policy has priority.
Questionable sources are those that have a poor reputation for checking the facts, lack meaningful editorial oversight, or have an apparent conflict of interest.
Such sources include websites and publications expressing views widely considered by other sources to be promotional, extremist, or that rely heavily on unsubstantiated gossip, rumor, or personal opinion. Questionable sources should be used only as sources for material on themselves, such as in articles about themselves; see below. They are not suitable sources for contentious claims.
Predatory open access journals are questionable due to the absence of quality control in the peer-review process.
Anyone can create a personal web page, self-publish a book, or claim to be an expert. Self-published material, such as books, patents, newsletters, personal websites, open wikis, personal or group blogs (as distinguished from newsblogs, above), content farms, podcasts, Internet forum postings, and social media postings, are largely not acceptable as sources. Self-published sources may be considered reliable if published by an established subject-matter expert, whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable, independent publications.[g] Be careful when using such sources: if the information in question is suitable for inclusion, someone else will likely have published it in independent, reliable sources.[1] Never use self-published sources as third-party sources about living people, even if the author is an expert, well-known professional researcher, or writer.
Self-published and questionable sources may be used as sources of information about themselves, usually in articles about themselves or their activities, without the self-published source requirement that they are established experts in the field, so long as:
This policy also applies to material made public by the source on social networking websites such as Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Reddit, Instagram and Facebook.
Do not use articles from Wikipedia (whether English Wikipedia or Wikipedias in other languages) as sources, since Wikipedia is a user-generated source. Do not use websites mirroring Wikipedia content or publications relying on material from Wikipedia as sources. Content from a Wikipedia article is not considered reliable unless it is backed up by citing reliable sources. Confirm that these sources support the content, then use them directly.[2]
An exception is allowed when Wikipedia itself is being discussed in the article. These may cite content from Wikipedia or a sister project to support a statement about Wikipedia. Wikipedia or the sister project is a primary source in this case and may be used following the policy for primary sources. Any such use should avoid original research, undue emphasis on Wikipedia's role or views, and inappropriate self-reference. The article text should say that the material is sourced from Wikipedia.
Do not reject reliable sources just because they are difficult or costly to access. Some reliable sources are not easily accessible. For example, an online source may require payment, and a print-only source may be available only through libraries. Rare historical sources may even be available only in special museum collections and archives. If you have trouble accessing a source, others might do so for you (see WikiProject Resource Exchange).

Citations to non-English reliable sources are allowed on the English Wikipedia. However, because this project is in English, English-language sources are preferred over non-English ones when they are available and of equal quality and relevance. As with sources in English, if a dispute arises involving a citation to a non-English source, editors may request a quotation of relevant portions of the original source be provided, either in text, in a footnote, or on the article talk page.[h] (See Template:Request quotation.)

If you quote a non-English reliable source (whether in the main text or in a footnote), a translation into English should accompany the quote. Translations published by reliable sources are preferred over translations by Wikipedians, but translations by Wikipedians are preferred over machine translations. When using a machine translation of source material, editors should be reasonably certain that the translation is accurate and the source is appropriate. Editors should not rely upon machine translations of non-English sources in contentious articles or biographies of living people. If needed, ask an editor who can translate it for you.
The original text is usually included with the translated text in articles when translated by Wikipedians, and the translating editor is usually not cited. When quoting any material, whether in English or in some other language, be careful not to violate copyright; see the fair-use guideline.
While information must be verifiable for inclusion in an article, not all verifiable information must be included. Consensus may determine that inclusion of a verifiable fact or claim does not improve an article, and other policies may indicate that the material is inappropriate. Such information should be omitted or presented instead in a different article.
The responsibility for achieving consensus for inclusion is on those seeking to include disputed content.
If you want to request an inline citation for an unsourced statement, you can tag a sentence with the {{citation needed}} template. You can also leave a note on the talk page asking for a source, or move the material to the talk page and ask for a source there. To request verification that a reference supports the text, tag it with {{verification needed}}. Material that fails verification may be tagged with {{failed verification}} or removed. It helps other editors to explain your rationale for using templates to tag material in the template, edit summary, or on the talk page.
Take special care with contentious material about living and recently deceased people. Unsourced or poorly sourced material that is contentious, especially text that is negative, derogatory, or potentially damaging, should be removed immediately rather than tagged or moved to the talk page.

Any exceptional claim requires multiple high-quality sources.[3] Warnings (red flags) that should prompt extra caution include:
Do not plagiarize or breach copyright when using sources. Summarize source material in your own words as much as possible; when quoting or closely paraphrasing a source, use an inline citation, and in-text attribution where appropriate.
Do not link to any source that violates the copyrights of others per contributors' rights and obligations. You can link to websites that display copyrighted works as long as the website has licensed the work or uses the work in a way compliant with fair use. Knowingly directing others to material that violates copyright may be considered contributory copyright infringement. If there is reason to think a source violates copyright, do not cite it. This is particularly relevant when linking to sites such as Scribd or YouTube, where due care should be taken to avoid linking to material violating copyright.
Even when information is cited to reliable sources, you must present it with a neutral point of view (NPOV). Articles should be based on thorough research of sources. All articles must adhere to NPOV, fairly representing all majority and significant-minority viewpoints published by reliable sources, in rough proportion to the prominence of each view. Tiny-minority views need not be included, except in articles devoted to them. If there is a disagreement between sources, use in-text attribution: ""John Smith argues X, while Paul Jones maintains Y,"" followed by an inline citation. Sources themselves do not need to maintain a neutral point of view. Indeed, many reliable sources are not neutral. Our job as editors is simply to summarize what reliable sources say.
If no reliable, independent sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it (i.e., the topic is not notable).
However, notability is based on the existence of suitable sources, not on the state of sourcing in an article.
The no original research policy (NOR) is closely related to the Verifiability policy. Among its requirements are:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Culture_(France),Ministry of Culture (France),"
The Ministry of Culture (French: Ministère de la Culture [ministɛʁ də la kyltyʁ]) is the ministry of the Government of France in charge of national museums and the monuments historiques. Its goal is to maintain the French identity through the promotion and protection of the arts (visual, plastic, theatrical, musical, dance, architectural, literary, televisual and cinematographic) on national soil and abroad. Its budget is mainly dedicated to the management of the Archives Nationales (six national sites and hundred decentralised storage facilities) and the regional Maisons de la culture (culture centres).
Its main office is in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement of Paris on the Rue de Valois.[1][2] It is headed by the Minister of Culture, a cabinet member. The current officeholder has been Rachida Dati since 11 January 2024.
Deriving from the Italian and Burgundian courts of the Renaissance, the notion that the state had a key role to play in the sponsoring of artistic production and that the arts were linked to national prestige was found in France from at least the 16th century on. During the pre-revolutionary period, these ideas are apparent in such things as the creation of the Académie française, the Académie de peinture et de sculpture and other state-sponsored institutions of artistic production, and through the cultural policies of Louis XIV's minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert.
The modern post of Minister of Culture was created by Charles de Gaulle in 1959 and the first officeholder was the writer André Malraux. Malraux was responsible for realising the goals of the droit à la culture ('right to culture'), an idea which had been incorporated in the Constitution of France and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), by democratising access to culture, while also achieving the Gaullist aim of elevating the ""grandeur"" ('greatness') of post-war France. To this end, he created numerous regional cultural centres throughout France and actively sponsored the arts. Malraux's artistic tastes included the modern arts and the avant-garde, but on the whole he remained conservative.
Under President François Mitterrand the Minister of Culture was Jack Lang who showed himself to be far more open to popular cultural production, including jazz, rock and roll, rap music, graffiti, bande dessinées, fashion and food. His famous phrase ""économie et culture, même combat"" ('economy and culture: it's the same fight') is representative of his commitment to cultural democracy and to active national sponsorship and participation in cultural production. In addition to the creation of the Fête de la Musique and overseeing the French Revolution bicentennial (1989), he was in charge of the massive architectural program of the François Mitterrand years (the so-called Grands travaux; 'Great Works') that gave permission for the building of the Bibliothèque nationale, the new Louvre, the Arab World Institute, the Musée d'Orsay, the Opéra-Bastille, the ""Grande Arche"" of La Défense (the Parisian business quarter), the new seat of the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance, the Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre, and the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie and Cité de la Musique, both in the Parc de la Villette.
The Ministry of Jacques Toubon was notable for a number of laws (the ""Toubon Laws"") enacted for the preservation of the French language, both in advertisements (all ads must include a French translation of foreign words) and on the radio (35% of songs on French radio stations must be in French), ostensibly in reaction to the presence of English.
The following people were appointed Minister of Culture of France:
Since the French constitution does not identify specific ministers (merely speaking of ""the minister in charge of"" this or that), each government may label each ministry as they wish, or even have a broader ministry in charge of several governmental sectors. Hence, the ministry has gone through a number of different names:

The Ministry of Culture is made up of a variety of internal divisions, including:
The Ministry has access to one inter-ministerial division:
The Ministry also runs three ""delegations"" (administrative boards):
Finally, the Ministry shares in the management of the National Centre of Cinema (Centre national de la cinématographie, CNC), a public institution.[3]
The Alliance française is run by the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs.[4]
On the national level, the Ministry also runs:
The Ministry of Culture is responsible for, or a major sponsor of, a number of annual cultural activities, including the Fête de la Musique, the Maison de la culture de Grenoble, the Festival d'Avignon, the Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles, the Joconde (online database of objects in French museums), the Base Mérimée (database of listed heritage monuments), and the Maître d'art program.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Brittany,University of Western Brittany,"The University of Western Brittany (French: Université de Bretagne-Occidentale; UBO) is a French university, located in Brest, in the Academy of Rennes. On a national scale, in terms of graduate employability, the university oscillates between 18th and 53rd out of 69 universities depending on fields of study.[1] Overall, the university is ranked 12th out of 76 universities in France.[2]
The University of Western Brittany is in Brittany, on the north-western coast of France. It is a multicampus university, with the main site in Brest and satellite campuses in Quimper and Morlaix.
Brest is an hour from Paris by air, or four hours by train.
Brest is one of the world's marine science capitals and is home to 60% of French marine researchers, as well as several major organizations such as IFREMER and IPEV. The city is also famous for its sailing activities. Brittany's economic development is driven by the agri-food, health, and telecommunications sectors.
French universities function via a system of collegiate administration. Each institution is led by a team of lecturer-researchers and overseen by a president, bringing together representatives from all affiliated faculties and institutes, as well as student-elected delegates. Universities are chiefly financed by the French government.
6 faculties
7 specialized institutes
1 engineering school
1 midwifery school
The university is an active member of the University of the Arctic.[3] UArctic is an international cooperative network based in the Circumpolar Arctic region, consisting of more than 200 universities, colleges, and other organizations with an interest in promoting education and research in the Arctic region.[4]
The university also participates in UArctic's mobility program north2north. The aim of that program is to enable students of member institutions to study in different parts of the North.[5]
French research is essentially academic in nature, encompassing the work of university laboratories and their partner organisations. UBO is home to 37 laboratories, some of which are supported by prestigious French research bodies, such as CNRS, INSERM, and IRD.
There are four principal areas of research at UBO :

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Restoration_in_France,Bourbon Restoration in France,"The Bourbon Restoration was the period of French history during which the House of Bourbon returned to power after the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814 and 1815. The second Bourbon Restoration lasted until the July Revolution of 1830, during the reigns of Louis XVIII (1814–1815, 1815–1824) and Charles X (1824–1830), brothers of the late King Louis XVI. Exiled supporters of the monarchy returned to France, which had been profoundly changed by the French Revolution. Exhausted by the Napoleonic Wars, the kingdom experienced a period of internal and external peace, stable economic prosperity and the preliminaries of industrialisation.[4]
Following the collapse of the Directory in the Coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799), Napoleon Bonaparte became ruler of France as leader of the Consulate. By the Consulate's end with the creation of the First French Empire on 18 May 1804, Napoleon had consolidated his power into an authoritarian personal rule. After Napoleon spent the next ten years expanding his empire by successive military victories, a coalition of European powers defeated him in the War of the Sixth Coalition, ended the First Empire in 1814, and restored the monarchy to the brothers of Louis XVI. The first Bourbon Restoration lasted from 6 April 1814 to 20 March 1815, when Napoleon managed to escape from exile on the island of Elba and seized power once more. Following Napoleon's final defeat at Waterloo, he was exiled to Saint Helena for the rest of his life. On 8 July 1815 the kingdom was restored, existing until 2 August 1830, after the July Revolution.[citation needed]
At the Congress of Vienna, the Bourbons were treated politely by the victorious monarchies, but had to give up nearly all the territorial gains made by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France since 1789.[5]
Unlike the absolutist Ancien Régime, the Restoration government was a constitutional monarchy, which limited the King's power. The new King, Louis XVIII, had been sober enough to realize during two decades in exile that France would not tolerate an attempt to resurrect the 18th century. He accepted the vast majority of reforms instituted from 1792 to 1814. Continuity was his basic policy. He did not try to recover land and property taken from the émigrés. He continued in peaceful fashion the main objectives of Napoleon's foreign policy, such as the limitation of Austrian influence. He reversed Napoleon's actions regarding Spain and the Ottoman Empire, restoring the friendships that had prevailed until 1792.[6]
Politically, the period was characterised by a conservative reaction, and consequent minor but persistent civil unrest and disturbances.[7] Otherwise, the political establishment was stable until the subsequent reign of Charles X.[4] It also saw the reestablishment of the Catholic Church as a major power in French politics.[8] Throughout the Bourbon Restoration, France experienced a period of stable economic prosperity and the preliminaries of industrialisation.[4]
The eras of the French Revolution and Empire brought a series of major changes to France which the Bourbon Restoration did not reverse.[9][10][11]
Administration: First, France was now highly centralised, with all important decisions made in Paris. The political geography was completely reorganised and made uniform, dividing the country into more than 80 départements which have endured into the 21st century. Each department had an identical administrative structure, and was tightly controlled by a prefect appointed by the government in Paris. The thicket of overlapping legal jurisdictions of the pre-Revolutionary regime had all been abolished, and there was now one standardised legal code, administered by judges appointed by Paris, and supported by police under national control.[citation needed]
The Church: The Revolutionary governments had confiscated all the lands and buildings of the Catholic Church, selling them to innumerable buyers, and it was politically impossible to restore them. The bishop still ruled his diocese (which was aligned with the new department boundaries) and communicated with the Pope through the government. Bishops, priests, nuns, and other religious, once severely persecuted, were paid state salaries.[citation needed]
All the old religious rites and ceremonies were retained, and the government maintained France's religious buildings. The Church was allowed to operate its own seminaries and to some extent local schools as well, although this became a central political issue into the 20th century. Bishops were much less powerful than before, and had no political voice. The Catholic Church refocused on a new emphasis on personal piety, influencing the faithful.[12]
Education: Public education was centralised, with the Grand Master of the University of France controlling every element of the national educational system from Paris. New technical universities were opened in Paris which to this day have a critical role in training the elite.[13]
The aristocracy: Conservatism was bitterly split into the returning ancient aristocracy and the new elite arising under Napoleon after 1796. The new elite, the 'noblesse d'empire', ridiculed the older group as an outdated remnant of a discredited regime that had led the nation to disaster. Both groups shared a fear of social disorder, but the level of distrust as well as the cultural differences were too great for political cooperation to be possible.[14]
The returning old aristocracy recovered much of the land they had owned directly. However, they lost all their old seigneurial rights to the rest of the farmland, and the peasants were no longer under their control. The pre-Revolutionary aristocracy had dallied with the ideas of the Enlightenment, but now was much more conservative and supportive of the Catholic Church. For the best jobs, meritocracy was the new policy, and aristocrats had to compete directly with the growing business and professional class.[citation needed]
Citizens' rights: Public anti-clerical sentiment in Paris became stronger, but was now based in certain elements of the middle class and even the peasantry; the greatest masses of French people, who were peasants in the countryside, supported the Church. Citizens gained new rights and a new sense of possibilities. Although relieved of many of the old burdens, controls, and taxes, the peasantry was still highly traditional in its social and economic behaviour. Many eagerly took on mortgages to buy as much land as possible for their children, so debt was an important factor in their calculations. The working class in the cities was a small element, freed of many restrictions imposed by mediaeval guilds. However, France was very slow to industrialise, and much of the work remained drudgery without machinery or technology to help. France was still split into localities, especially in terms of language, but now there was an emerging French nationalism that focused on national pride in the army and foreign affairs.[15]
In April 1814, the Armies of the Sixth Coalition restored Louis XVIII to the throne, the brother and heir of the late Louis XVI. A popular constitution was granted by the King: the Charter of 1814. It presented all Frenchmen as equal before the law[16] while retaining substantial prerogatives for the King and nobility and limited voting to those paying at least 300 francs a year in direct taxes.
The King was the supreme head of the state. He commanded the land and sea forces, declared war, made treaties of peace, alliance, and commerce, appointed all public officials, and made the necessary regulations and ordinances for the execution of the laws and the security of the state.[17] Louis XVIII was relatively liberal and willing to compromise, choosing many centrist cabinets.[18]
Louis XVIII died in September 1824 and was succeeded by his brother, who reigned as Charles X. The new King pursued a more conservative form of governance than Louis XVIII. His laws included the Anti-Sacrilege Act (1825–1830). Exasperated by Parisian resistance and disrespect, the King and his ministers attempted to curb liberalism by intervening in the general election of 1830 through the July Ordinances. This sparked a revolution in the streets of Paris, Charles X abdicated along with his son the Dauphin in favour of Henri, Duke of Bordeaux, appointing Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans regent. Instead, Louis Philippe hid the King's request and allowed the Chamber of Deputies to proclaim him 'King of the French', ushering in the July Monarchy, which would collapse in 1848.
Louis XVIII's restoration to the throne in 1814 was effected largely through the support of Napoleon's former foreign minister, Talleyrand, who convinced the victorious Allied Powers of the desirability of a Bourbon Restoration.[19] The Allies had initially split on the best candidate for the throne: Britain favoured the Bourbons, the Austrian Habsburgs considered a regency for Napoleon's son (as his Habsburg mother would have been the regent), and the Russians were open to either the Duke of Orléans, Louis Philippe, or Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, Napoleon's former Marshal, who was heir-presumptive to the Swedish throne. Napoleon was offered to keep the throne in February 1814, on the condition that France return to its 1792 frontiers, but he refused.[19] The feasibility of the Restoration was in doubt, but the allure of peace to a war-weary French public, and demonstrations of support for the Bourbons in Paris, Bordeaux, Marseille, and Lyon, helped reassure the Allies.[20]
Louis, in accordance with the Declaration of Saint-Ouen,[21] granted a written constitution, the Charter of 1814, which guaranteed a bicameral legislature with a hereditary/appointive Chamber of Peers and an elected Chamber of Deputies – their role was consultative (except on taxation), as only the King had the power to propose or sanction laws, and appoint or recall ministers.[22] The franchise was limited to men with considerable property holdings, and just 1% of people could vote.[22] Many of the legal, administrative, and economic reforms of the Revolutionary period were left intact; the Napoleonic Code,[22] which guaranteed legal equality and civil liberties, the peasants' biens nationaux, and the new system of dividing the country into départments were not undone by the King. Relations between Church and state remained regulated by the Concordat of 1801. The constitution was not imposed on the King, the preamble declaring it to be a 'concession and grant', given 'by the free exercise of our royal authority'.[23]
Napoleon, on 20 March 1815, returned to Paris from Elba to find the city indifferent or even against his return. On his route, most troops sent to stop his march, including some that were nominally royalist, felt more inclined to join the former Emperor than to stop him.[24] Louis XVIII left Paris for Ghent on 19 March where he established the Ghent government-in-exile.[25][26]
After Napoleon was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo and sent again into exile, Louis XVIII returned. During his absence a small revolt in the traditionally pro-royalist Vendée was put down, but there were otherwise few subversive acts favouring the Restoration, even though Napoleon's popularity was low.[27]
Talleyrand was again influential in seeing that the Bourbons were restored to power, as was Joseph Fouché,[28][29] Napoleon's minister of police during the Hundred Days. This Second Restoration saw the beginning of the Second White Terror, largely in the south, where unofficial groups supporting the monarchy sought revenge against those who had aided Napoleon's return: about 200–300 were killed while thousands fled. About 70,000 government officials were dismissed. The pro-Bourbon perpetrators were often known as the Verdets because of their green cockets, which was the colour of the Count of Artois – this being the title of the future Charles X at the time, who was associated with the hardline ultra-royalists, or Ultras. After a period in which local authorities did not stop the violence, the King and his ministers sent out officials to restore order.[30]
A new Treaty of Paris was signed on 20 November 1815, which had more punitive terms than the 1814 treaty. France was ordered to pay 700 million francs in indemnities and the country's borders were reduced to their 1790 status, rather than 1792 as in the previous treaty. Until 1818, France was occupied by 1.2 million foreign soldiers, including around 200,000 under the command of the Duke of Wellington, and France was made to pay the costs of their accommodation and rations.[31][32] The promise of tax cuts, prominent in 1814, was impracticable because of these payments. The legacy of this, and the White Terror, left Louis XVIII with a formidable opposition.[31]
Louis's chief ministers were at first moderate,[33] including Talleyrand, the Duke of Richelieu, and Élie, Duke of Decazes; Louis XVIII himself followed a cautious policy.[34] The chambre introuvable, elected in 1815, given the nickname 'unobtainable' by Louis, was dominated by an overwhelming ultra-royalist majority which quickly acquired the reputation of being 'more royalist than the King'. The legislature threw out the Talleyrand-Fouché government and sought to legitimize the White Terror, passing judgement against enemies of the state, sacking 50,000–80,000 civil servants, and dismissing 15,000 army officers.[31] Richelieu, an émigré who had left in October 1789, who 'had nothing at all to do with the new France',[34] was appointed Prime Minister. The chambre introuvable, meanwhile, continued to aggressively uphold the place of the monarchy and the Church, and called for more commemorations for historical royal figures.[b] Over the course of the parliamentary term, the ultra-royalists increasingly began to fuse their brand of politics with state ceremony, much to Louis' distress.[36] Decazes, perhaps the most moderate minister, moved to stop the politicisation of the National Guard (many Verdets had been drafted in) by banning political demonstrations by the militia in July 1816.[37]
Owing to tension between the King's government and the ultra-royalist Chamber of Deputies, the latter began to assert their rights. After they attempted to obstruct the 1816 budget, the government conceded that the chamber had the right to approve state expenditure. However, they were unable to gain a guarantee from the King that his cabinets would represent the majority in parliament.[38]
In September 1816, the chamber was dissolved by Louis XVIII, and electoral manipulation[citation needed] resulted in a more liberal chamber in 1816. Richelieu served until 29 December 1818, followed by Jean-Joseph, Marquis Dessolles until 19 November 1819, and then Decazes (in reality the dominant minister from 1818 to 1820)[39][40] until 20 February 1820. This was the era in which the Doctrinaires dominated policy, hoping to reconcile the monarchy with the French Revolution. The following year, the government changed the electoral laws, resorting to gerrymandering, and altering the franchise to allow some rich men of trade and industry to vote,[41] in an attempt to prevent the ultras from winning a majority in future elections. Press censorship was clarified and relaxed, some positions in the military hierarchy were made open to competition, and mutual schools were set up that encroached on the Catholic monopoly of public primary education.[42][43] Decazes purged a number of ultra-royalist prefects and sub-prefects, and in by-elections, an unusually high proportion of Bonapartists and republicans were elected, some of whom were backed by ultras resorting to tactical voting.[39] The ultras were strongly critical of the practice of giving civil service employment or promotions to deputies, as the government continued to consolidate its position.[44]
By 1820, the opposition liberals—who, with the ultras, made up half the chamber—proved unmanageable, and Decazes and the king were looking for ways to revise the electoral laws again, to ensure a more tractable conservative majority. In February 1820, the assassination by a Bonapartist of the Duc de Berry, the ultrareactionary son of Louis' ultrareactionary brother and heir-presumptive, the future Charles X, triggered Decazes' fall from power and the triumph of the Ultras.[45]
Richelieu returned to power for a short interval, from 1820 to 1821. The press was more strongly censored, detention without trial was reintroduced, and Doctrinaire leaders, such as François Guizot, were banned from teaching at the École Normale Supérieure.[45][46] Under Richelieu, the franchise was changed to give the wealthiest electors a double vote, in time for the November 1820 election. After a resounding victory, a new Ultra ministry was formed, headed by Jean-Baptiste de Villèle, a leading Ultra who served for six years. The ultras found themselves back in power in favourable circumstances: Berry's wife, the duchesse de Berry, gave birth to a ""miracle child"", Henri, seven months after the duc's death; Napoleon died on Saint Helena in 1821, and his son, the duc de Reichstadt, remained interned in Austrian hands. Literary figures, most notably Chateaubriand, but also Hugo, Lamartine, Vigny, and Nodier, rallied to the ultras' cause. Both Hugo and Lamartine later became republicans, whilst Nodier was formerly.[47][48] Soon, however, Villèle proved himself to be nearly as cautious as his master, and, so long as Louis lived, overtly reactionary policies were kept to a minimum.[citation needed]

The ultras broadened their support, and put a stop to growing military dissent in 1823, when intervention in Spain, in favour of Spanish Bourbon King Ferdinand VII, and against the Liberal Spanish Government, fomented popular patriotic fervour. Despite British backing for the military action, the intervention was widely seen as an attempt to win back influence in Spain, which had been lost to the British under Napoleon. The French expeditionary army, called the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis, was led by the duc d'Angoulême, the comte d'Artois's son. The French troops marched to Madrid and then to Cádiz, ousting the Liberals with little fighting (April to September 1823), and would remain in Spain for five years. Support for the ultras amongst the voting rich was further strengthened by doling out favours in a similar fashion to the 1816 chamber, and fears over the charbonnerie, the French equivalent of the carbonari. In the 1824 election, another large majority was secured.[49]
Louis XVIII died on 16 September 1824 and was succeeded by his brother, the Comte d'Artois, who took the title of Charles X.[citation needed]
The accession to the throne of Charles X, the leader of the ultra-royalist faction, coincided with the ultras' control of power in the Chamber of Deputies; thus, the ministry of the comte de Villèle was able to continue. The restraint Louis had exercised on the ultra-royalists was removed.[citation needed]
As the country underwent a Christian revival in the post-revolutionary years, the ultras worked to raise the status of the Roman Catholic Church once more. The Church and State Concordat of 11 June 1817 was set to replace the Concordat of 1801, but, despite being signed, it was never validated. The Villèle government, under pressure from the Chevaliers de la Foi including many deputies, voted in the Anti-Sacrilege Act in January 1825, which punished by death the theft of consecrated hosts. The law was unenforceable and only enacted for symbolic purposes, though the act's passing caused a considerable uproar, particularly among the Doctrinaires.[50] Much more controversial was the introduction of the Jesuits, who set up a network of colleges for elite youth outside the official university system. The Jesuits were noted for their loyalty to the Pope and gave much less support to Gallican traditions. Inside and outside the Church they had enemies, and the king ended their institutional role in 1828.[51]
New legislation paid an indemnity to royalists whose lands had been confiscated during the Revolution. Although this law had been engineered by Louis, Charles was influential in seeing that it was passed. A bill to finance this compensation, by converting government debt (the rente) from 5% to 3% bonds, which would save the state 30 million francs a year in interest payments, was also put before the chambers. Villèle's government argued that rentiers had seen their returns grow disproportionately to their original investment, and that the redistribution was just. The final law allocated state funds of 988 million francs for compensation (le milliard des émigrés), financed by government bonds at a value of 600 million francs at 3% interest. Around 18 million francs were paid per year.[52] Unexpected beneficiaries of the law were some one million owners of biens nationaux, the old confiscated lands, whose property rights were now confirmed by the new law, leading to a sharp rise in its value.[53]
On 29 May 1825 the Coronation of Charles X took place at Reims Cathedral, the traditional site of French coronations.
In 1826, Villèle introduced a bill reestablishing the law of primogeniture, at least for owners of large estates, unless they chose otherwise. The liberals and the press rebelled, as did some dissident ultras, such as Chateaubriand. Their vociferous criticism prompted the government to introduce a bill to restrict the press in December, having largely withdrawn censorship in 1824. This only inflamed the opposition even more, and the bill was withdrawn.[54]
The Villèle cabinet faced increasing pressure in 1827 from the liberal press, including the Journal des débats, which sponsored Chateaubriand's articles. Chateaubriand, the most prominent of the anti-Villèle ultras, had combined with other opponents of press censorship (a new law had reimposed it on 24 July 1827) to form the Société des amis de la liberté de la presse; Choiseul-Stainville, Salvandy and Villemain were among the contributors.[55] Another influential society was the Société Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera, which worked within the confines of legislation banning the unauthorized meetings of more than 20 members. The group, emboldened by the rising tide of opposition, was of a more liberal composition (associated with Le Globe) and included members such as Guizot, Rémusat, and Barrot.[56] Pamphlets were sent out which evaded the censorship laws, and the group provided organizational assistance to liberal candidates against pro-government state officials in the November 1827 election.[57]
In April 1827, the King and Villèle were confronted by an unruly National Guard. The garrison which Charles reviewed, under orders to express deference to the king but disapproval of his government, instead shouted derogatory anti-Jesuit remarks at his devoutly Catholic niece and daughter in law, Marie Thérèse, Madame la Dauphine. Villèle suffered worse treatment, as liberal officers led troops to protest at his office. In response, the Guard was disbanded.[57] Pamphlets continued to proliferate, which included accusations in September that Charles, on a trip to Saint-Omer, was colluding with the Pope and planned to reinstate the tithe, and had suspended the Charter under the protection of a loyal garrison army.[58]
By the time of the election, the moderate royalists (constitutionalists) were also beginning to turn against Charles, as was the business community, in part due to a financial crisis in 1825, which they blamed on the government's law of indemnification.[59][60] Hugo and a number of other writers, dissatisfied with the reality of life under Charles X, also began to criticize the regime.[61] In preparation for the 30 September registration cut-off for the election, opposition committees worked furiously to get as many voters as possible signed up, countering the actions of préfects, who began removing certain voters who had failed to provide up-to-date documents since the 1824 election. 18,000 voters were added to the 60,000 on the first list; despite préfect attempts to register those who met the franchise and were supporters of the government, this can mainly be attributed to opposition activity.[62] Organization was mainly divided behind Chateaubriand's Friends and the Aide-toi, which backed liberals, constitutionnels, and the contre-opposition (constitutional monarchists).[63]
The new chamber did not result in a clear majority for any side. Villèle's successor, the vicomte de Martignac, who began his term in January 1828, tried to steer a middle course, appeasing liberals by loosening press controls, expelling Jesuits, modifying electoral registration, and restricting the formation of Catholic schools.[64] Charles, unhappy with the new government, surrounded himself with men from the Chevaliers de la Foi and other ultras, such as the Prince de Polignac and La Bourdonnaye. Martignac was deposed when his government lost a bill on local government. Charles and his advisers believed a new government could be formed with the support of the Villèle, Chateaubriand, and Decazes monarchist factions, but chose a chief minister, Polignac, in November 1829 who was repellent to the liberals and, worse, Chateaubriand. Though Charles remained nonchalant, the deadlock led some royalists to call for a coup, and prominent liberals for a tax strike.[65]
At the opening of the session in March 1830, the King delivered a speech that contained veiled threats to the opposition; in response, 221 deputies (an absolute majority) condemned the government, and Charles subsequently prorogued and then dissolved parliament. Charles retained a belief that he was popular amongst the unenfranchised mass of the people, and he and Polignac chose to pursue an ambitious foreign policy of colonialism and expansionism, with the assistance of Russia. France had intervened in the Mediterranean a number of times after Villèle's resignation, and expeditions were now sent to Greece and Madagascar. Polignac also initiated the French conquest of Algeria; victory was announced over the Dey of Algiers in early July. Plans were drawn up to invade Belgium, which was shortly to undergo its own revolution. However, foreign policy did not prove sufficient to divert attention from domestic problems.[66][67]
Charles's dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, his July Ordinances which set up rigid control of the press, and his restriction of suffrage resulted in the July Revolution of 1830. The major cause of the regime's downfall, however, was that, while it managed to keep the support of the aristocracy, the Catholic Church and even much of the peasantry, the ultras' cause was deeply unpopular outside of parliament and with those who did not hold the franchise,[68] especially the industrial workers and the bourgeoisie.[69] A major reason was a sharp rise in food prices, caused by a series of bad harvests 1827–1830. Workers living on the margin were very hard-pressed, and angry that the government paid little attention to their urgent needs.[70]
Charles abdicated in favor of his grandson, the Comte de Chambord, and left for England. However, the liberal, bourgeois-controlled Chamber of Deputies refused to confirm the Comte de Chambord as Henry V. In a vote largely boycotted by conservative deputies, the body declared the French throne vacant, and elevated Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans, to power.[citation needed]
There is still considerable debate among historians as to the actual cause of the downfall of Charles X. What is generally conceded, though, is that between 1820 and 1830, a series of economic downturns combined with the rise of a liberal opposition within the Chamber of Deputies, ultimately felled the conservative Bourbons.[71]
Between 1827 and 1830, France faced an economic downturn, industrial and agricultural, that was possibly worse than the one that sparked the revolution. A series of progressively worsening grain harvests in the late 1820s pushed up the prices on various staple foods and cash crops.[72] In response, the rural peasantry throughout France lobbied for the relaxation of protective tariffs on grain to lower prices and ease their economic situation. However, Charles X, bowing to pressure from wealthier landowners, kept the tariffs in place. He did so based upon the Bourbon response to the ""Year Without a Summer"" in 1816, during which Louis XVIII relaxed tariffs during a series of famines, caused a downturn in prices, and incurred the ire of wealthy landowners, who were the traditional source of Bourbon legitimacy. Thus, between 1827 and 1830, peasants throughout France faced a period of relative economic hardship and rising prices.
At the same time, international pressures, combined with weakened purchasing power from the provinces, led to decreased economic activity in urban centers. This industrial downturn contributed to the rising poverty levels among Parisian artisans. Thus, by 1830, multiple demographics had suffered from the economic policies of Charles X.[citation needed]
While the French economy faltered, a series of elections brought a relatively powerful liberal bloc into the Chamber of Deputies. The 17-strong liberal bloc of 1824 grew to 180 in 1827, and 274 in 1830. This liberal majority grew increasingly dissatisfied with the policies of the centrist Martignac and the ultra-royalist Polignac, seeking to protect the limited protections of the Charter of 1814. They sought both the expansion of the franchise, and more liberal economic policies. They also demanded the right, as the majority bloc, to appoint the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.[citation needed]
Also, the growth of the liberal bloc within the Chamber of Deputies corresponded roughly with the rise of a liberal press within France. Generally centered around Paris, this press provided a counterpoint to the government's journalistic services, and to the newspapers of the right. It grew increasingly important in conveying political opinions and the political situation to the Parisian public, and can thus be seen as a crucial link between the rise of the liberals and the increasingly agitated and economically suffering French masses.[citation needed]
By 1830, the Restoration government of Charles X faced difficulties on all sides. The new liberal majority clearly had no intention of budging in the face of Polignac's aggressive policies. The rise of a liberal press within Paris which outsold the official government newspaper indicated a general shift in Parisian politics towards the left. And yet, Charles' base of power was certainly toward the right of the political spectrum, as were his own views. He simply could not yield to the growing demands from within the Chamber of Deputies. The situation would soon come to a head.[citation needed]
The Charter of 1814 had made France a constitutional monarchy. While the king retained extensive power over policy-making, as well as the sole power of the Executive, he was, nonetheless, reliant upon the Parliament to accept and pass his legal decrees.[73] The Charter also fixed the method of election of the Deputies, their rights within the Chamber of Deputies, and the rights of the majority bloc. Thus, in 1830, Charles X faced a significant problem. He could not overstep his constitutional bounds, and yet, he could not pursue his policies with a liberal majority within the Chamber of Deputies. He was ready for stark action and made his move after a final no-confidence vote by the liberal house majority, in March 1830. He set about to alter the Charter of 1814 by decree. These decrees, known as the ""Four Ordinances"", dissolved the Chamber of Deputies, suspended the liberty of the press, excluded the more liberal commercial middle-class from future elections, and called for new elections.[74]
Opinion was outraged. On 10 July 1830, before the king had even made his declarations, a group of wealthy, liberal journalists and newspaper proprietors, led by Adolphe Thiers, met in Paris to decide upon a strategy to counter Charles X. It was decided then, nearly three weeks before the Revolution, that in the event of Charles' expected proclamations, the journalistic establishment of Paris would publish vitriolic criticisms of the king's policies in an attempt to mobilise the masses. Thus, when Charles X made his declarations on 25 July 1830, the liberal journalism machine mobilised, publishing articles and complaints decrying the despotism of the king's actions.[75]
The urban mobs of Paris also mobilised, driven by patriotic fervour and economic hardship, assembling barricades and attacking the infrastructure of Charles X. Within days, the situation escalated beyond the ability of the monarchy to control it. As the Crown moved to shut down liberal periodicals, the radical Parisian masses defended those publications. They also launched attacks against pro-Bourbon presses, and paralysed the coercive apparatus of the monarchy. Seizing the opportunity, the liberals in Parliament began drafting resolutions, complaints, and censures against the king. The king finally abdicated on 30 July 1830. Twenty minutes later, his son, Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, who had nominally succeeded as Louis XIX, also abdicated. The Crown nominally then fell upon the son of Louis Antoine's younger brother, who was in line to become Henry V. However, the newly empowered Chamber of Deputies declared the throne vacant, and on 9 August, elevated Louis-Philippe, to the throne. Thus, the July Monarchy began.[76]
Louis Philippe I ascended the throne on the strength of the July Revolution of 1830, and ruled, not as ""King of France"" but as ""King of the French"", marking the shift to national sovereignty. The Orléanists remained in power until 1848. Following the ousting of the last king to rule France during the February 1848 Revolution, the French Second Republic was formed with the election of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte as President (1848–1852). In the French coup of 1851, Napoleon declared himself Emperor Napoleon III of the Second Empire, which lasted from 1852 to 1870.[citation needed]
Political parties saw substantial changes of alignment and membership under the Restoration. The Chamber of Deputies oscillated between repressive ultra-royalist phases and progressive liberal phases. The repression of the White Terror excluded opponents of the monarchy from the political scene, but individuals of influence who had different visions of the French constitutional monarchy still clashed.[77][78]
All parties remained fearful of the common people, who had no voting rights and whom Adolphe Thiers later referred to by the term ""cheap multitude"". Their political sights were set on a class favoritism. Political changes in the Chamber were due to abuse by the majority tendency, involving a dissolution and then an inversion of the majority, or critical events; for example, the assassination of the Duc de Berry in 1820.[citation needed]
Disputes were a power struggle between the powerful (royalty against deputies) rather than a fight between royalty and populism. Although the deputies claimed to defend the interests of the people, most had an important fear of common people, of innovations, of socialism and even of simple measures, such as the extension of voting rights.[citation needed]
The principal political parties during the Restoration are described below.
The Ultra-royalists wished for a return to the Ancien Régime which prevailed before 1789: absolute monarchy, domination by the nobility, and the monopoly of politics by ""devoted Christians"". They were anti-Republican, anti-democratic, and preached Government on High. Although they tolerated vote censitaire, a form of democracy limited to those paying taxes above a high threshold, they found the Charter of 1814 to be too revolutionary. They wanted a re-establishment of privileges, a major political role for the Catholic Church, and a politically active, rather than ceremonial, king: Charles X.[79]
Prominent ultra-royalist theorists were Louis de Bonald and Joseph de Maistre. Their parliamentary leaders were François Régis de La Bourdonnaye, comte de La Bretèche and, in 1829, Jules de Polignac. The main royalist newspapers were La Quotidienne and La Gazette, supplemented by the Drapeau Blanc, named after the Bourbon white flag, and the Oriflamme, named after the battle standard of France.[citation needed]
The Doctrinaires were mostly rich and educated middle-class men: lawyers, senior officials of the Empire, and academics. They feared the triumph of the aristocracy, as much as that of the democrats. They accepted the Royal Charter as a guarantee of freedom and civil equality which nevertheless reined in the ignorant and excitable masses. Ideologically they were classical liberals who formed the centre-right of the Restoration's political spectrum: they upheld both capitalism and Catholicism, and attempted to reconcile parliamentarism (in an elite, wealth-based form) and monarchism (in a constitutional, ceremonial form), while rejecting both the absolutism and clericalism of the Ultra-Royalists, and the universal suffrage of the liberal left and republicans. Important personalities were Pierre Paul Royer-Collard, François Guizot, and the count of Serre. Their newspapers were Le Courrier français and Le Censeur.[80]
The Liberals were mostly petite-bourgeoisie: doctors and lawyers, men of law, and, in rural constituencies, merchants and traders of national goods. Electorally they benefitted from the slow emergence of a new middle-class elite, due to the start of the Industrial Revolution.[citation needed]
Some of them accepted the principle of monarchy, in a strictly ceremonial and parliamentary form, while others were moderate republicans. Constitutional issues aside, they agreed on seeking to restore the democratic principles of the French Revolution, such as the weakening of clerical and aristocratic power, and therefore thought the constitutional Charter was not sufficiently democratic, and disliked the peace treaties of 1815, the White Terror and the return to pre-eminence of clergy and of nobility. They wished to lower the taxable quota to support the middle-class as a whole, to the detriment of the aristocracy, and thus they supported universal suffrage or at least a wide opening-up of the electoral system to the modest middle-classes such as farmers and craftsmen. Important personalities were parliamentary monarchist Benjamin Constant, officer of the Empire Maximilien Sebastien Foy, republican lawyer Jacques-Antoine Manuel, and the Marquis de Lafayette. Their newspapers were La Minerve, Le Constitutionnel, and Le Globe.[81]
The only active Republicans were on the left to far-left, based among the workers. Workers had no vote and were not listened to. Their demonstrations were repressed or diverted, causing, at most, a reinforcement of parliamentarism, which did not mean democratic evolution, only wider taxation. For some, such as Blanqui, revolution seemed the only solution. Garnier-Pagès, and Louis-Eugène and Éléonore-Louis Godefroi Cavaignac considered themselves to be Republicans, while Cabet and Raspail were active as socialists. Saint-Simon was also active during this period, and made direct appeals to Louis XVIII before his death in 1824.[82]
By 1800 the Catholic Church was poor, dilapidated and disorganised, with a depleted and aging clergy. The younger generation had received little religious instruction, and was unfamiliar with traditional worship.[83] However, in response to the external pressures of foreign wars, religious fervour was strong, especially among women.[84] Napoleon's Concordat of 1801 provided stability and ended attacks on the Church.
With the Restoration, the Catholic Church again became the state religion, supported financially and politically by the government. Its lands and financial endowments were not returned, but the government paid salaries and maintenance costs for normal church activities. The bishops regained control of Catholic affairs. The aristocracy before the Revolution was lukewarm to religious doctrine and practice, but the decades of exile created an alliance of throne and altar. The royalists who returned were much more devout, and much more aware of their need for a close alliance with the Church. They had discarded fashionable skepticism and now promoted the wave of Catholic religiosity that was sweeping Europe, with a new reverence for the Virgin Mary, the saints, and popular religious rituals such as praying the rosary. Devotion was far stronger and more visible in rural areas than in Paris and other cities. The population of 32 million included about 680,000 Protestants and 60,000 Jews, who were extended toleration. The anti-clericalism of Voltaire and the Enlightenment had not disappeared, but it was in abeyance.[85]
At the elite level, there was a dramatic change in intellectual climate from intellectual classicism to passionate romanticism. An 1802 book by François-René de Chateaubriand entitled Génie du christianisme (""The Genius of Christianity"") had an enormous influence in reshaping French literature and intellectual life, emphasising the centrality of religion in creating European high culture. Chateaubriand's book ""did more than any other single work to restore the credibility and prestige of Christianity in intellectual circles and launched a fashionable rediscovery of the Middle Ages and their Christian civilisation. The revival was by no means confined to an intellectual elite, however, but was evident in the real, if uneven, rechristianisation of the French countryside.""[86]
With the restoration of the Bourbons in 1814, the reactionary aristocracy with its disdain for entrepreneurship returned to power. British goods flooded the market, and France responded with high tariffs and protectionism to protect its established businesses, especially handcrafts and small-scale manufacturing such as textiles. The tariff on iron goods reached 120%.[87] Agriculture had never needed protection, but now demanded it due to the lower prices of imported foodstuffs, such as Russian grain. French winegrowers strongly supported the tariff – their wines did not need it, but they insisted on a high tariff on the import of tea. One agrarian deputy explained: ""Tea breaks down our national character by converting those who use it often into cold and stuffy Nordic types, while wine arouses in the soul that gentle gaiety that gives Frenchmen their amiable and witty national character.""[88] The French government falsified official statistics to claim that exports and imports were growing – actually there was stagnation, and the economic crisis of 1826–29 disillusioned the business community and readied them to support the revolution in 1830.[89]
Romanticism reshaped art and literature.[90] It stimulated the emergence of a wide new middle class audience.[91]
Among the most popular works were:
The city grew slowly in population from 714,000 in 1817 to 786,000 in 1831. During the period Parisians saw the first public transport system, the first gas street lights, and the first uniformed Paris policemen. In July 1830, a popular uprising in the streets of Paris brought down the Bourbon monarchy.[92]
After two decades of war and revolution, the restoration brought peace and quiet, and general prosperity. Gordon Wright says, ""Frenchmen were, on the whole, well governed, prosperous, contented during the 15-year period; one historian even describes the restoration era as 'one of the happiest periods in [France's] history.[93]
France had recovered from the strain and disorganization, the wars, the killings, the horrors, of two decades of disruption. It was at peace throughout the period. It paid a large war indemnity to the winners, but managed to finance that without distress; the occupation soldiers left peacefully. France's population increased by three million, and prosperity was strong from 1815 to 1825, with the depression of 1825 caused by bad harvests. The national credit was strong, there was significant increase in public wealth, and the national budget showed a surplus every year. In the private sector, banking grew dramatically, making Paris a world center for finance, along with London. The Rothschild family was world-famous, with the French branch led by James Mayer de Rothschild (1792–1868). The communication system was improved, as roads were upgraded, canals were lengthened, and steamboat traffic became common. Industrialization was delayed in comparison to Britain and Belgium. The railway system had yet to make an appearance. Industry was heavily protected with tariffs, so there was little demand for entrepreneurship or innovation.[94][95]
Culture flourished with the new romantic impulses. Oratory was highly regarded, and sophisticated debate flourished. Châteaubriand and Madame de Stael (1766–1817) enjoyed Europe-wide reputations for their innovations in romantic literature. She made important contributions to political sociology, and the sociology of literature.[96] History flourished; François Guizot, Benjamin Constant and Madame de Staël drew lessons from the past to guide the future.[97] The paintings of Eugène Delacroix set the standards for romantic art. Music, theater, science, and philosophy all flourished.[98] Higher learning flourished at the Sorbonne. Major new institutions gave France world leadership in numerous advanced fields, as typified by the École Nationale des Chartes (1821) for historiography, the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in 1829 for innovative engineering; and the École des Beaux-Arts for the fine arts, reestablished in 1830.[99]
Charles X repeatedly exacerbated internal tensions, and tried to neutralize his enemies with repressive measures. They totally failed and forced him into exile for the third time. However the government's handling of foreign affairs was a success. France kept a low profile, and Europe forgot its animosities. Louis and Charles had little interest in foreign affairs, so France played only minor roles. For example, it helped the other powers deal with Greece and Turkey. Charles X mistakenly thought that foreign glory would cover domestic frustration, so he made an all-out effort to conquer Algiers in 1830. He sent a massive force of 38,000 soldiers and 4,500 horses carried by 103 warships and 469 merchant ships. The expedition was a dramatic military success.[100] It even paid for itself with captured treasures. The episode launched the second French colonial empire, but it did not provide desperately needed political support for the King at home.[101]
The 2007 French historical film Jacquou le Croquant, directed by Laurent Boutonnat and starring Gaspard Ulliel and Marie-Josée Croze, is based on the Bourbon Restoration.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAFARI,SAFARI,"SAFARI was an attempt by the French government, under the presidency of Georges Pompidou, to create a centralized database of personal data. SAFARI stands for Système Automatisé pour les Fichiers Administratifs et le Répertoire des Individus, ""Automated  System for Administrative Files and the Repertory of Individuals"".
The first mention of the project was made in a three-page article in the INSEE central review in March 1970.[1] The French government began secretly working on the SAFARI project in 1973. The project aimed to identify French citizens with a unique number that would connect the information about them from various databases.[2] In particular, it would use the INSEE code (also used as a Social Security number). The system was to be based on the Iris-80 computer.
On March 21, 1974, an article in the newspaper Le Monde by journalist Philippe Boucher revealed the existence of the project. The public outcry was immense, some critics comparing it to the national identity database created by the Vichy regime during Nazi occupation.[2] The massive popular rejection of SAFARI prompted the minister of justice to create the Commission on Data Processing and Freedom, also known as the Tricot Commission after its leader Bernard Tricot.[3] This led to the creation of the CNIL to ensure data privacy, as well as an accompanying 1978 law, the Data Protection and Liberties Act, restricting the storage and processing of personal data.[4]

Laurent Fabius (French: [lɔʁɑ̃ fabjys]; born 20 August 1946) is a French politician who has served in a number of capacities, most recently as president of the Constitutional Council from 2016 to 2025. A member of the Socialist Party, he previously served as Prime Minister of France from 17 July 1984 to 20 March 1986. Fabius was 37 years old when he was appointed and is, after Gabriel Attal, the second youngest prime minister of the Fifth Republic.
Fabius was also President of the National Assembly from 1988 to 1992 and again from 1997 to 2000. Fabius served in the government as Minister of Finance from 2000 to 2002 and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2012 to 2016. 
Fabius was born in the affluent 16th arrondissement of Paris, the son of Louise (née Strasburger-Mortimer; 1911–2010) and André Fabius (1908–1984). He is the younger brother of Catherine Leterrier and François Fabius. His parents were from Ashkenazi Jewish families who converted to Catholicism. Fabius was raised a Catholic;[1] he has three sons, David (born 1978) with his partner Christine d'Izarny Gargas, Thomas (born 1981) and Victor (born 1983) with his spouse, Françoise Castro.
Fabius' received secondary education at the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly and Lycée Louis-le-Grand, where he was a pupil of Donald Adamson. Fabius then went up to institutions that are training grounds for academics (École normale supérieure), and senior civil servants and executives (Sciences Po, École nationale d'administration).[citation needed]
After his studies, Fabius became an auditor for the Council of State. A member of the Socialist Party (PS) since 1974, Fabius was first elected to the National Assembly in 1978 for the fourth constituency of Seine-Maritime. Fabius quickly gained entry to the circle of François Mitterrand, the leader of the party.
When Mitterrand was elected as President of France in 1981, Fabius was nominated as Minister of the Budget. Two years later, Fabius became Minister of Industry, and pursued the policy of ""industrial restructuring"". In 1984, in a government shake-up, Mitterrand chose Fabius as prime minister (choosing Fabius over Pierre Bérégovoy and Jacques Delors). At the age of 37 he was the youngest French prime minister since 1819.[2]
Fabius advocated a new kind of French socialism, which accepted the market economy. It marked a shift away from traditional socialist concerns with state ownership and instead looked for ways to modernize industry, and increase productivity, even at the cost of some jobs. Fabius also worked to modernize the party's archaic structures.[3] In social policy, a law of December 1984 replaced allowance for orphans with a family support allowance, and empowered family allowance funds to aid in recovery of child support when a parent fails to pay. The allowable income for recipients of the young child allowance was increased (July 1984) for families with three or more children. The Fabius Government also sought to reduce penalties on families with working mothers by substantially increasing the income ceiling for dual-income families receiving the young child allowance. A parental education fund was created (1985), which provided for payments to each person who stops work or reduces hours of work as a result of the birth of any child beyond the first two, for which the parent(s) is/are responsible.[4] In 1985, as a means of upholding the rights of homosexuals, the penal code was amended to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of ""moral habits"" which included sexual orientation, which also secured the right to same-sex relationships.[5]
A decree of 17 July 1984 set up an Immigrants' Council, which could be consulted on questions of concern to the immigrant population regarding living conditions, housing, work, employment, education, and training, as well as social and cultural activities.[6] In November 1984, an allowance was introduced if the parent concerned had been employed for two or more years. Known as the ""allocation parentale d'education,"" this allowance provided 1,000 francs per month for parents who decided to take two years of parental leave after the birth of their first child. The ""allocation au jeune enfant,"" introduced in January 1985, was paid to all families at a flat rate for each child from the third month of pregnancy for nine months, regardless of the parents' income. Payment was to continue after this period for 8 out of 10 families for a further 32 months on a means-tested basis. In effect, this created a benefit for the first child in lower income families.[7] The government, however, reduced the daily maternity allowance from 90% to 84% of the basic wage, while the reimbursement rate of so-called ""comfort"" medicinal products was also lowered.[8]
In June 1985, a law was passed allowing first offenders who had committed petty crimes to serve sentences of six months or less in public-service jobs. A July 1985 law tripled the amount of aid for victims of crimes. Legislation was introduced later that year to restrict the use of preventive detention, and ensure that the rights of suspects were better protected.[9]
A decree of September 1984 reconstituted the Supreme Council for the Prevention of Occupational Risks, a consultative body representing both sides of industry, to make it function more flexibly, and was extended to include crafts.[6] A law of January 1985 extended the scope for associations whose formal objectives include combating racism to institute a civil action where an offence has been committed against an individual by reason of his national or ethnic origin, race or religion. A special 1985 holiday programme was introduced, directed particularly at young people outside the traditional circuits of organised leisure activities. Provisions were also adopted that same year according new rights to families and users of child social assistance, particularly as regards information and the association of families and children in decision-making. The right to maternity leave was also extended to the father, in the event of the death of the mother in child-birth. The father was entitled to post-natal leave and could claim an allowance under the maternity insurance scheme.[8]
In the field of education, much time and effort was spent on improving the system and educational outcomes. Vast sums were provided to improve technical education in schools, with closer ties established between education and industry, a programme was launched to train 25,000 teachers per annum in the use of computers, 100,000 computers were purchased for students to use, and 1 billion francs were provided for purchasing modern machine tools. The university system was reformed along practical, technological lines, with a degree in new technologies introduced, the reorientation of the first cycle to include greater emphasis on languages and new technologies, the provision of students with orientation and career opportunity meetings to help them plan their course of study in relation to the job market. Universities were encouraged to open up to industry and new technologies via training more skilled researchers and considering the practical needs of business.[9] In 1985, a vocational baccalaureat was established.[10] to provide training for highly skilled workers.[11]
In employment policy, the Fabius Government introduced a number of measures designed to mitigate the effects of unemployment. In 1984, three youth training programmes were set up to ease the transition from school to work. The contrat de qualification (CQ) combined work and training for young workers during a 6-month to 2-year period. The contrat d'adaptation (CA) was aimed at facilitating the hiring of young workers by adapting existing skills to the
work setting. Under this scheme, individuals worked for a maximum 6-month period while receiving at least 200 hours of training. The stages d'initiation a La vie professionnelle (SIVP) provided schoolleavers with an initiation into work life to enable them to sample and then choose a career. The pre-training stages lasted for three to six months, with the worker receiving at least twenty-five hours of training a month. Participation in this scheme could lead to a CQ or CA.[12]
Under a law of August 1985 governing leave for training, retraining and reemployment, employers undertake to offer such leave to a specific number of wage-earners whose redundancy would have been authorised; during this period the workers concerned will be able to benefit from a number of activities organised to help them find new jobs. A law of January 1985 widened the scope of certain social provisions, including the encouragement of training work experience schemes for young people by setting up introductory apprenticeships and extending the fifth week of annual paid holiday to nursery school assistants. A law of July 1985, while increasing the number of cases in which a firm could use temporary workers and relaxing conditions regarding the duration of certain types of contracts, also introduced changes in the rules relating to the duration of probation periods and made it harder to re-employ temporary workers in the same job before a waiting period has expired, etc.[8]
The way in which the occupational health services are organised was modified by two decrees issued in March 1986. The first established regional occupational health committees while the second made important changes to the regulations. A Decree of March 1986 laid down conditions for the approval of organisations conducting atmospheric monitoring and made a French standard on such work compulsory, while a Decree of March 1986 on the information and test results to be provided under the Labour Code introduced in France the European Community testing methods for analysing dangerous substances as well as the OECD ""codes of practice"" governing the procedures to be followed when conducting these tests.[13]
During the early Eighties, the Socialists introduced the ""congé de conversion"" (""conversion leave""), which received widespread publicity in 1984 when redundancy measures were introduced for the shipbuilding and steel industries. These combined the traditional tool of early retirement for redundant workers over the age of fifty with a ""conversion leave"" for others. These leaves suspended (but did not break) the work contract for a period of up to two years, and during this time the individual received 70% of their previous wage together with retraining in a new occupation. After the retraining was over, workers were promised two job offers. In 1985, the Fabius Government universalised the congé. The revamped congé de conversion offered redundant workers 65% of their previous salary (in line with the benefits for early retirement and unemployment compensation) and a training period of 4–10 months. Between 1985 and 1987, however, only 15,000 workers had taken advantage of the congés, and only one-third succeeded in their ""conversion."" A year earlier, in 1984, the Fabius government established the travaux d'utilite collective (TUC) programme to prepare school leavers for professional life. This scheme offered unemployed youth between the ages of 16 and 21 (extended to 25 in 1985), the opportunity to work half time in a public sector job.[12]
Improvements were also made to the system of benefits for the long-term unemployed whose rights to unemployment insurance had expired. Subject to certain conditions regarding previous activity and resources, the daily solidarity allowance paid to them was raised from FF 42 to FF.64.50 on 1 April. This could be as high as FF 86 per day for unemployed persons aged 55 and over who could give proof of 20 years' paid employment, while unemployed persons aged 57 1/2 had to give proof of only ten paid employment to obtain this allowance and are not required to look for a job. A law of July 1985 amended the articles of the Code de Travail (Labour Code) to bring them into line with EEC Directive 79/781/EEC on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances. A decree of January 1985 laid down a list of work for which the employees of temporary labour agencies may not be employed, the work in question involving exposure to certain toxic agents and special risks for temporary workers for whom it is difficult to provide medical supervision. A decree of April 1985 laid down technical instructions to be observed by occupational physicians responsible for medical checks on employees exposed to substances which may cause malignant damage to the bladder. The scope of a decree of October 1983, which laid down a list of and the conditions for the labelling and packaging of paints, varnishes, printing inks, adhesives and similar products was extended by a decree of July 1985 to include enamelling preparations. A circular of May 1985 on the prevention of occupational cancers specified the roles of the employer, the trade unions and the occupational physician in preventing this hazard, the effects of which may appear only long after exposure to the agents in question.[8]
A law of January 1986 contained a number of changes regarding workers' right to express their views. The obligation to negotiate agreements on the way in which this right is exercised, which used to be limited to firms employing at least 200 workers, was extended to all businesses where trade unions had established one or more sections and appointed a shop steward. The obligation to negotiate did not, however, apply to firms without trade union representations and with less than 50 workers, even if a staff representative had been appointed as trade union delegate. A law of February 1986 amending the labour code included various changes e.g. to ensure that wage-earners received a stable income, independent of fluctuations in weekly working hours. A decree on the protection of workers exposed to benzene was issued in February 1986 with the purpose of simplifying and updating the relevant regulations, most of which dated back to 1939. A decree was issued in March 1986 which amended certain provisions in the Labour Code concerning substances and preparations hazardous to workers, thus transferring into national law the provisions of the Council Directive 79/831/EEC amending for the sixth time Directive 67/548/EEC on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances. The procedures for forwarding documents concerning inspections and verifications for health and safety purposes were laid down in a decree dated 13 March 1986. A further decree, issued that same year, laid down the health and safety requirements to be met by mobile agricultural and forestry machinery, while a further decree issued on the same date related to the protection of workers exposed to methyl bromide. A decree of January 1986 covers the flooring of fixed scaffolding while a decree of March 1986 laid down the health and safety requirements to be met by mobile agricultural and forestry machinery. A circular of January 1986 on the labelling and packaging of chemical products for industrial use defined the scope of the 1983 decrees on the labelling of chemical products and contained a ""guide to EEC packaging"". Following a number of accidents involving pyralene transformers, a circular of March 1986 on the hazards associated with pyralene and its decomposition products sets out, for the inspection officers involved, the risks associated with such products, the sectors most at risk, the elementary precautions to be taken, and the regulations to be applied.[13]
Despite the Fabius Government's achievements in social policy, it was unable to prevent a rise in social inequality during its time in office, a situation arguably exacerbated by austerity measures introduced by the government. Although the rate of inflation fell, unemployment continued to increase,[9] standing at 11% in early 1986, compared with 8% in 1983.[14] Concern over rising inequality in France was expressed in the publication of a number of books on both ""the new poverty"" and ""social exclusion,"" which had become major public preoccupations.[15] As a result of a decline in unemployment insurance coverage, those who had no welfare assistance had to rely on local charity and local assistance. This led to cases of some supermarkets providing free food parcels for the unemployed. In 1985, the Fabius Government increased the wealth tax to provide subsidies for organisations providing basic services such as hot meals, agreed to make empty housing and surplus food stocks available, and decided to provide a basic allowance of 40 francs per day for some of the unemployed over the age of 50 who had been left out of the benefit scheme.[16]
The Fabius Government's inability to prevent both rising unemployment and inequality arguably contributed to the defeat of the French Socialists in the 1986 legislative election, which led Fabius to step down as prime minister.
The symbol of a modern French socialism, he was weakened by the ""Infected blood scandal"". His government was accused of having knowingly let doctors give haemophiliacs transfusions of blood infected by HIV. A judicial process similar to impeachment acquitted him of all personal moral responsibility in the matter.
After the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior, a Greenpeace ship, on 10 July 1985, Prime Minister Fabius summoned journalists to his office on 22 September 1985 to read a 200-word statement in which he said: ""The truth is cruel,"" and acknowledged that ""Agents of the French secret service sank this boat. They were acting on orders.""[17] He had previously denied that the bombers of the Rainbow Warrior were in the employ of the French secret service.[18]
Fabius came to be seen as Lionel Jospin's rival to be Mitterrand's heir. He failed to win the First Secretaryship of the party in 1988 and 1990 (Rennes Congress) in spite of Mitterrand's support. Installed as President of the National Assembly in 1988 (at 41 years of age, the equal youngest in the history of the lower house).
In 1989, he was elected to the European Parliament where he served on the Committee on Institutional Affairs, while simultaneously remaining President of the National Assembly. He used this dual role to successfully propose the establishment of The Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union (COSAC) - a conference of  Members of Parliament (MPs) drawn from parliamentary committees responsible for European Union affairs in each national parliament and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).[19]
He succeeded finally in becoming First Secretary of the party in 1992, but resigned after the Socialist disaster of the 1993 legislative election.[citation needed]
He came back as president of the National Assembly in 1997, then as Minister of Economy and Finance in Lionel Jospin's cabinet between 2000 and 2002. After Jospin's retirement, he hoped to return as Socialist leader but he failed. He declared that his mind was changed about a number of matters and he joined the left-wing of the party.
In this position he was the leader of the defeated No camp in the vote that took place among the members of his party on 1 December 2004, to decide the stance that the party would take on the impending referendum on the European Constitution. He went on to lead the rebel faction of the party advocating a no vote in the 2005 Referendum, and was seen as the spearhead of the whole no campaign in France. After the no vote won, the party leader gave an assurance that he could remain in the party though he was dismissed from the party's National Executive Committee.
Fabius was a candidate in the Socialist Party's primary to be the party's candidate in the 2007 presidential election, but finished third, behind Ségolène Royal, the winner, and Dominique Strauss-Kahn. He was subsequently re-elected to the National Assembly in the June 2007 parliamentary election.[20]
On 17 May 2012, Laurent Fabius became foreign minister in the government of Jean-Marc Ayrault, appointed prime minister by President François Hollande.
His mandate had three milestones:
As foreign minister, Fabius was also chair of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference which took place in Paris. His way of engaging with all delegates to achieve a successful agreement has been described as crucial,[22] and something that will make him ""go down in history as one of the great diplomats"".[23]
Fabius was chosen by President François Hollande to succeed Jean-Louis Debré as President of the Constitutional Council. The change became effective on 8 March 2016.
On 12 November 2023, he took part in the March for the Republic and Against Antisemitism in Paris in response to the rise in antisemitism since the start of the Gaza war.[24]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros,Eros,"Eros (UK: /ˈɪərɒs, ˈɛrɒs/, US: /ˈɛrɒs, ˈɛroʊs/ ⓘ;[3] Ancient Greek: Ἔρως, lit. 'Love, Desire') is the Greek god of love and sex. The Romans referred to him as Cupid or Amor.[4] In the earliest account, he is a primordial god, while in later accounts he is the child of Aphrodite.
He is usually presented as a handsome young man, though in some appearances he is a juvenile boy full of mischief, ever in the company of his mother. In both cases, he is winged and carries his signature bow and arrows, which he uses to make both mortals and immortal gods fall in love, often under the guidance of Aphrodite. His role in myths is mostly complementary, and he often appears in the presence of Aphrodite and the other love gods and often acts as a catalyst for people to fall in love, but has little unique mythology of his own; the most major exception being the myth of Eros and Psyche, the story of how he met and fell in love with his wife.
Eros and Cupid, are also known, in art tradition, as a Putto (pl. Putti). The Putto's iconography seemed to have, later, influenced the figure known as a Cherub (pl. Cherubim). The Putti and the Cherubim can be found throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in Christian art.[5](pp 2–4) This latter iteration of Eros/Cupid became a major icon and symbol of Valentine's Day.[6]
The Greek ἔρως, éros meaning 'desire' (whence eroticism) comes from the verb ἔραμαι, éramai and in infinitive form ἐρᾶσθαι, erãsthai 'to desire, love',[7] itself of uncertain etymology. R. S. P. Beekes speculates a Pre-Greek origin.[8]
Eros appears in ancient Greek sources under several different guises. In the earliest sources (the cosmogonies, the earliest philosophers, and texts referring to the mystery religions), he is one of the primordial gods involved in the coming into being of the cosmos. In later sources, however, Eros is represented as the son of Aphrodite, whose mischievous interventions in the affairs of gods and mortals cause bonds of love to form, often illicitly. Ultimately, in the later satirical poets, he is represented as a blindfolded child, the precursor to the chubby Renaissance Cupid, whereas in early Greek poetry and art, Eros was depicted as a young adult male who embodies sexual power, and a profound artist.[9]
A cult of Eros existed in pre-classical Greece, but it was much less important than that of Aphrodite. However, in late antiquity, Eros was worshiped by a fertility cult in Thespiae. In Athens, he shared a very popular cult with Aphrodite, and the fourth day of every month was sacred to him (also shared by Herakles, Hermes and Aphrodite).[10]
The Thespians celebrated the Erotidia (Ancient Greek: Ἐρωτίδεια) meaning festivals of Eros.[11][12][13]
He had the epithet Klêidouchos (Κλειδοῦχος), meaning holding/bearing the keys, because he was holding the key to hearts.[14] In addition, he had the epithet Pandemos (Πάνδημος, ""common to all the people"").[15]
According to Hesiod's Theogony (c. 700 BC), one of the most ancient of Greek sources, Eros (Love) was the fourth god to come into existence, coming after Chaos, Gaia (Earth), and Tartarus.[16]
Homer does not mention Eros. However, Parmenides (c. 400 BC), one of the pre-Socratic philosophers, makes Eros the first of all the gods to come into existence.[17]
Aristophanes, in his comedy The Birds (414 BC), presents a parody of a cosmogony which has been considered Orphic,[18] in which Eros is born from an egg laid by Night (Nyx):
In some versions the Orphic Egg which contains Eros is created by Chronos, and it is Eros who bore Nyx as his daughter and took her as his consort. Eros was called ""Protogonos"" meaning ""first-born"" because he was the first of the immortals that could be conceived by man, and was thought of as the creator of all other beings and the first ruler of the universe. Nyx bore to Eros the gods Gaia and Ouranos. Eros passes his scepter of power to Nyx, who then passes it to Ouranos. The primordial Eros was also called Phanes ('illuminated one'), Erikepaios ('power'), Metis ('thought') and Dionysus. Zeus was said to have swallowed Phanes (Eros), and absorbing his powers of creation remade the world anew, such that Zeus was then both creator and ruler of the universe. The Orphics also thought that Dionysus was an incarnation of the primordial Eros, and that Zeus (the modern ruler) passed the scepter of power to Dionysus. Thus Eros was the first ruler of the universe, and as Dionysus he regained the scepter of power once again.[20]
In later myths, he was the son of Aphrodite. The 6th-to-5th-century BC lyric poet Simonides considered him to be the son of Aphrodite and Ares.[21]
The story of Eros and Psyche has a longstanding tradition as a folktale of the ancient Greco-Roman world long before it was committed to literature in Apuleius's Latin novel, The Golden Ass. The novel itself is written in a picaresque Roman style, yet Psyche retains her Greek name even though Eros and Aphrodite are called by their Latin names (Cupid and Venus). Also, Cupid is depicted as a young adult, rather than a fat winged child (putto amorino).[26]
The story tells of the quest for love and trust between Eros and Psyche. Aphrodite was jealous of the beauty of mortal princess Psyche, as men were leaving her altars barren to worship a mere mortal woman instead, and so she commanded her son Eros, the god of love, to cause Psyche to fall in love with the ugliest creature on earth. Instead, Eros falls in love with Psyche himself and spirits her away to his home. Their fragile peace is ruined by a visit from Psyche's jealous sisters, who cause Psyche to betray the trust of her husband. Wounded both emotionally and physically, Eros leaves his wife, and Psyche wanders the Earth, looking for her lost love. She visits the Temple of Demeter and the Temple of Hera looking for advice. Eventually, she finds her way to Aphrodite's temple and approaches Aphrodite asking for her help. Aphrodite imposes four difficult tasks on Psyche, which she is able to achieve by means of supernatural assistance.
After successfully completing these tasks, Aphrodite relents. After a near death experience, Zeus turns Psyche into an immortal to live amongst the gods with her husband Eros. Together they had a daughter, Voluptas or Hedone (meaning physical pleasure, bliss).
In Greek mythology, Psyche was the deification of the human soul. She was portrayed in ancient mosaics as a goddess with butterfly wings (because psyche was also the Ancient Greek word for ""butterfly""). The Greek word psyche literally means ""soul, spirit, breath, life, or animating force"".
In the Gnostic narrative found in On the Origin of the World, Eros, during the universe's creation, is scattered in all the creatures of Chaos, existing between the midpoint of light and darkness as well as the angels and people. Later, Psyche pours her blood upon him, causing the first rose to sprout up on the Earth, followed by every flower and herb.[27]
Eros features in two Dionysus-related myths. In the first, Eros made Hymnus, a young shepherd, to fall in love with the beautiful Naiad Nicaea. Nicaea never reciprocated Hymnus's affection, and he in desperation asked her to kill him. She fulfilled his wish, but Eros, disgusted with Nicaea's actions, made Dionysus fall in love with her by hitting him with a love arrow. Nicaea rejected Dionysus, so he filled the spring she used to drink from with wine. Intoxicated, Nicaea lay to rest as Dionysus forced himself on her. Afterwards, she sought to find him seeking revenge, but never found him.[28]
In the other, one of Artemis's maiden nymphs Aura boasted of being better than her mistress, due to having a virgin's body, as opposed to Artemis's sensuous and lush figure, thereby bringing into question Artemis's virginity. Artemis, angered, asked Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance and retribution, to avenge her, and Nemesis ordered Eros to make Dionysus fall in love with Aura. The tale then continues in the same manner as Nicaea's myth; Dionysus gets Aura drunk and then rapes her.[29]
Eros made two chaste hunting companions of Artemis, Rhodopis and Euthynicus, to fall in love with each other at the behest of his mother Aphrodite, who took offence at them rejecting her domain of love and marriage. Artemis then punished Rhodopis by turning her into a fountain.[30][31]
In another myth, Eros and Aphrodite played in a meadow, and had a light competition about which would gather the most flowers. Eros was in the lead thanks to his swift wings, but then a nymph named Peristera (""dove"") gathered some flowers herself and handed them over to Aphrodite, making her victorious. Eros turned Peristera into a dove.[32]
According to Porphyrius, Themis, the goddess of justice, played a role in Eros growing up. His mother Aphrodite once complained to Themis that Eros did not grow and remained a perpetual child, so Themis advised her to give him a brother. Aphrodite then gave birth to Anteros (meaning ""counter-love""), and whenever he was near him, Eros grew. But if Anteros was away, Eros shrank back to his previous, smaller size.[33]
Another time, when Eros had assumed his child-like appearance and tried bending his bow, the god Apollo, who was similarly an archer god as well, mocked him by saying that he should leave the weapons to the older gods, and bragged about his slaying of Python. Eros was angered, so he immediately struck Apollo with a love arrow, making him fall in love with Daphne, a virginal nymph of the woods. In the same fashion he struck Daphne with a lead arrow, which had the opposite effect, and made the nymph be repulsed by Apollo and his ardent wooing. In the end, Daphne would be transformed into a tree in order to escape the god's advances.[34]
Eros is imagined as a beautiful youth who carries bow and powerful arrows which he uses to make anyone fall madly in love. Ovid, a Roman author, elaborates on Eros's arsenal and specifies that Eros carries two kinds of arrows; the first are his golden arrows which induce a powerful feeling of love and affection on their target. The second kind are made of lead instead, and have the opposite effect; they make people averse to love, and fill their hearts with hatred.[34] This is mostly utilized in the story of Daphne and Apollo, where Eros made Apollo fall in love with the nymph, and Daphne to detest any forms of romance. Meanwhile, in Ovid's tale of Persephone's abduction by Hades, the abduction is initiated by Aphrodite and Eros; Aphrodite commands Eros to make Hades fall in love with his niece, so that their domain can reach the Underworld. Eros has to use his strongest possible arrow to make Hades's stern heart melt.[35]
In an Anacreon fragment, preserved by Athenaeus, the author laments how Eros struck him with a purple ball, making him fall in love with a woman who is attracted to other women, and shuns him over his white hair.[36]
Eros is characterized as a mighty entity who controls everyone, and even immortals cannot escape. Lucian satirized this concept in his Dialogues of the Gods, where Zeus chides Eros for making him fall in love with and then deceive so many mortal women, and even his mother Aphrodite advises him against using all the gods as his playthings. Nevertheless, Eros could not touch any of the virgin goddesses (Hestia, Athena and Artemis) who had all taken a vow of purity. Sappho writes of Artemis that ""limb-loosening Eros never goes near her.""[37]
A repetitive motif in ancient poetry included Eros being stung by bees. The story is first found in the Anacreontea, attributed to sixth century BC author Anacreon, and goes that Eros once went to his mother Aphrodite crying about being stung by a bee, and compared the small creature to a snake with wings. Aphrodite then asks him, if he thinks the bee's sting hurts so much, what he thinks about the pain his own arrows cause.[38]
Theocritus, coming a bit later during the fourth century BC, expanded the anecdote a little in his Idylls (Idyll XIX). Little Eros is stung by bees when he attempts to steal honey from their beehive. The bees pierce all of his fingers. He runs to his mother crying, and muses how creatures this small and cause pain so big. Aphrodite smiles and compares him to the bees, as he too is small, and causes pain much greater than his size.[38]
This little tale was retold in antiquity and Renaissance many times.
Pontianus of Nicomedia, a character in Deipnosophistae by Athenaeus, asserts that Zeno of Citium thought that Eros was the god of friendship and liberty.[11][12]
Erxias (Ἐρξίας) wrote that the Samians consecrated a gymnasium to Eros. The festival instituted in his honour was called the Eleutheria (Ἐλευθέρια), meaning ""liberty"".[11][12]
The Lacedaemonians offered sacrifices to Eros before they went into battle, thinking that safety and victory depend on the friendship of those who stand side by side in the battle. In addition, the Cretans offered sacrifices to Eros in their line of battle.[11][12]

Shohei Ohtani (Japanese: 大谷 翔平, Hepburn: Ōtani Shōhei; pronounced [oːtaɲi ɕoːheː], /ˈʃoʊheɪ oʊˌtɑːniː/ SHOH-hey oh-TAH-nee; born July 5, 1994) is a Japanese professional baseball designated hitter and pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). Nicknamed ""Shotime"", he has previously played in MLB for the Los Angeles Angels and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. Because of his elite contributions as a hitter and as a pitcher, a rarity as a two-way player, Ohtani's prime seasons have been considered among the greatest in baseball history, with some comparing them favorably to the early career of Babe Ruth.[1][2][3][4][5]
Considered early on as an elite two-way player, Ohtani was the first pick of the Fighters in the 2012 NPB draft. He played for the Fighters from 2013 through 2017 as a pitcher and an outfielder and won the 2016 Japan Series with them. The Fighters posted Ohtani to MLB after the 2017 season, and he signed with the Angels, soon winning the 2018 American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award. Following an injury-plagued 2019 and 2020, Ohtani hit 46 home runs and struck out 156 batters en route to winning his first AL Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) in 2021. His statistics were unprecedented in this two-way season, and he was given the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award.[d] In 2022, he became the first player in the modern era to qualify for both the hitting and pitching leaderboards in one season, finishing third in the AL with 219 strikeouts as a pitcher.[e]
Ohtani won his second AL MVP in 2023, leading the AL with 44 home runs while recording 10 wins as a pitcher. He was the first player to win multiple unanimous MVPs and the first Japanese-born player to win a league home run title.[7] After the 2023 season, Ohtani signed a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers, then the largest contract in professional sports history.[8] Since 2023, Ohtani's jerseys have sold more than any other player in the U.S., Japan and worldwide.[9] Unable to pitch in 2024 while recovering from a second elbow injury, Ohtani played as a DH for the Dodgers. He became the first player in MLB history to record 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in a season and was unanimously named the 2024 National League MVP.[f] He won the 2024 World Series in his first MLB postseason appearance.
Internationally, Ohtani represents Japan. At the 2023 World Baseball Classic, he won the MVP Award for the tournament following Japan's victory over the United States. The 2023 final was one of the most-watched baseball games in history,[11] culminating with Ohtani striking out Angels teammate and U.S. captain Mike Trout on a full count, securing a 3–2 win and Japan's third title.[12]
Ohtani was born to Kayoko and Toru Ohtani in Mizusawa (now part of Ōshū), Iwate, Japan, on July 5, 1994. His mother Kayoko was a national-level badminton player in high school and his father Tōru (徹), who worked at a local automobile manufacturing plant, was an amateur baseball player who played in the Japanese Industrial League.[13][14]
Ohtani is the youngest of three children. He has one older sister, Yuka, and one older brother, Ryuta (龍太), who is also an amateur baseball player in the Japanese Industrial League.[13]
In Japan, Ohtani was known as a ""yakyū shōnen"" (野球少年; ""baseball boy"")—a kid who lives, eats and breathes baseball.[14] Coached by his father, he displayed an aptitude for the game at an early age.[15] He began playing baseball in his second year of elementary school, and as a seventh-grader, Ohtani recorded all but one of 18 outs in a six-inning regional championship game.[13][14]
As a teenager, Ohtani could have played baseball for any powerhouse high school team in big cities such as Osaka or Yokohama.[14] Instead, he opted to stay local, selecting Hanamaki Higashi High School in Iwate Prefecture, Northern Japan,[16] the same high school as pitcher Yusei Kikuchi, whom he admired;[17] Ohtani competed there as a swimmer[18] and played baseball.[13] Ohtani's high school baseball coach, Hiroshi Sasaki, said that he was a fast swimmer who could have competed in the Olympics.[19]
Under Sasaki's guidance, Hanamaki Higashi's players lived on campus, returning home for only six days a year. Sasaki would assign toilet cleaning chores to Ohtani, to teach him humility.[14] In 2012, Ohtani threw a 99 mph (160 km/h) fastball as an 18-year-old high school pitcher, which at the time, had set a Japanese high school baseball record until it was surpassed by Rōki Sasaki's 101 mph (163 km/h) fastball in 2018.[20] Ohtani threw the pitch in the Japanese national high school baseball championship tournament, commonly called Summer Koshien.[21] In the 2012 18U Baseball World Championship, Ohtani had an 0–1 win–loss record with 16 strikeouts, eight walks, five hits, five runs, and a 4.35 earned run average (ERA) in 10+1⁄3 innings pitched.[22]
Ohtani expressed a desire to move directly to the major leagues after high school and received interest from numerous teams including the Texas Rangers, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers.[21][23] On October 21, 2012, he announced that he would pursue a career in Major League Baseball (MLB) rather than turn professional in Japan.[24] The Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters decided to draft him in the 2012 NPB Draft nevertheless, despite knowing that there was a high likelihood he would not play for them. After an exclusive negotiating window between him and the Fighters, Ohtani announced that he would sign with the Fighters and spend some years in Japan before a possible MLB move.[15][25] Hokkaido said it would allow Ohtani to serve as a pitcher and position player; the Los Angeles Dodgers, who had become Ohtani's top-choice MLB team, were not prepared to let him play both ways.[26] He was assigned the jersey number 11, previously worn by Yu Darvish.[27]
Ohtani made his debut at age 18 in the Fighters' season-opening game on March 29, 2013, playing as a right fielder.[28] He was selected for a Pacific League roster spot for the 2013 All-star game. As a pitcher, he finished the season with a 3–0 record in 11 starts. As a rookie Ohtani was used in both the outfield (leading the Fighters with 51 games in right) and as a pitcher.[29] He was the second Nippon Pro Baseball (NPB) rookie drafted out of high school the previous year to be used as both a pitcher and position player, following Kikuo Tokunaga in 1951; Ohtani was the first to start in both roles. He was the first NPB pitcher since Takao Kajimoto in 1963 to bat 3rd, 4th, or 5th and the first rookie hurler to do so since Junzo Sekine in 1950. He was the second player, following Osamu Takechi (also 1950), to start a game as a pitcher, bat in the heart of the order (3rd through 5th), and get a hit and a run batted in (RBI) in that game. He missed time during the year with a right ankle sprain and right cheekbone fracture.
For the season, he was 3–0 with a 4.23 ERA, 33 walks, and 46 strikeouts in 61+2⁄3 innings. and hit .238/.284/.376 in 204 plate appearances.[30] He had seven outfield assists and one error. His 8 hit batsmen tied Manabu Mima, Tadashi Settsu, Hideaki Wakui and Ryoma Nogami for fifth in the Pacific League. Ohtani received 4 of the 233 votes for the Nippon Professional Baseball Rookie of the Year Award (Pacific League), tying Tatsuya Sato for a distant second behind Takahiro Norimoto.[31] During his five-year tenure with the Fighters, Ohtani opted to live in the team's provided dormitories, while his parents oversaw his finances.[14]
Throughout the entire season, Ohtani performed double-duty as a pitcher and outfielder, utilizing his strong throwing arm as well as his impressive batting skills. As a hitter, he batted .274, with 28 extra-base hits (including 10 home runs), 31 RBIs, and a .842 on-base plus slugging percentage in 234 plate appearances. As a pitcher, he was 11–4 with a 2.61 ERA in 24 starts and struck out 179 (third in NPB) in 155+1⁄3 innings.[32] His 10.4 strikeouts per nine innings led the league and opponents hit just .223 against him.
In a September 7 game against the Orix Buffaloes, he homered to straightaway center at Kyocera Dome to become the first Japanese player to reach double digits in both home runs and wins.[33][34] He tossed a 1–0 shutout against Orix on September 13 and became the first pitcher out of high school to record a 1–0 shutout victory within his first two years for the Fighters since Toshiaki Moriyasu in 1967. He also became the first pitcher out of high school to notch two shutout victories within his first two years in the NPB since Yu Darvish.[35]
During the July 2014 All-Star Game, he threw a 101 mph (162 km/h) fastball in the bottom of the first inning, setting a new record for the fastest official pitch thrown by a Japanese pitcher, beating the record set by the Yakult Swallows' Yoshinori Sato in 2010 (100 mph (161 km/h)).[36] The jersey he wore during the game sold for 1.75 million yen ($17,000), making it the top seller at the All-Star 2014 charity auction. The proceeds were donated to three Tohoku earthquake children's relief funds.[37]
On October 5 against the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, Ohtani recorded the fastest pitch by a Japanese pitcher in an official game, tying Marc Kroon's allord for NPB pitchers. The pitch came against lead-off hitter Akaminai Ginji in the 1st inning. With the count 0–1, Ohtani threw a fastball that registered 101 mph (162 km/h) on the stadium radar gun and shattered Ginji's bat in half. He also hit 101 mph twice against the second hitter, Aoi Enomoto. Of the 15 pitches he threw in the first inning, eight were in the 160s; 99s in MPH.[38]
During the postseason, Ohtani was chosen to become a member of the national team, dubbed Samurai Japan, and participated in the Suzuki All-Star Series,[39] a five-game friendly competition with a squad of major leaguers. In Game 1, he pitched one shutout inning in relief, retiring three consecutive batters. He started Game 5 at the Sapporo Dome and, although his team ultimately lost (3–1), he wasn't charged with an earned run (he gave up two unearned), and of the 12 outs he recorded in four innings, he got seven via strikeout. He threw mostly fastballs, even clocked one at 99 mph (160 km/h), occasional curveballs, and a few forkballs in the mid-140s, including one he threw perfectly in the second inning to strike out Tampa Bay Rays star Ben Zobrist.[40][41][42][43]
In December, he became the second player out of high school in NPB history to reach 100M yen in salary in his third year, after Daisuke Matsuzaka in 2001. His new contract more than tripled his previous salary estimated at 30M yen.[15]
2015 marked Ohtani's third professional season (and second full season). Though his offensive production declined somewhat (five home runs), his performance on the mound was among the best in the league, earning him the starter role in the 2015 All-Star Game and the pitching spot in the end-of-year Pacific League Best Nine awards. Ohtani started the 2015 NPB All-Star Game 1 for the PL. He went two innings and struck out two, allowing one run (on a double by Yoshitomo Tsutsugo and a single by Jose Lopez), relieved by Nishi with a 1–0 deficit. The PL would lose 8–6 but he got a no-decision. He finished the season 15–5 with a 2.24 ERA, 196 strikeouts, and only 100 hits in 160+2⁄3 innings. He led the PL in ERA (.14 over Nishi), tied Wakui for the most wins, and was second in strikeouts (19 behind Norimoto, though he threw 34 fewer innings). He rarely played the field but did see some action at DH, hitting .202/.252/.376 with five home runs in 109 at-bats. He made the Best Nine as the PL's top hurler. He finished third in MVP voting again, placing behind Yanagita and Shogo Akiyama for the 2015 Pacific League MVP. Ohtani placed third in MVP voting (first among pitchers) and was one of three candidates considered for the 2015 Sawamura Award, given annually to the top pitcher in either league.[44]
Ohtani led the league in wins and winning percentage with a 15–5 record in just 22 starts, and his 2.24 ERA, five complete games, and three shutouts were also the best in the league. All these stats were career bests, as were his 196 strikeouts, 0.909 WHIP, and 11 strikeouts per nine innings.[45]
Ohtani was dominant for the Japanese national team in the 2015 Premier 12. He hit 100 mph while blowing away eventual champion South Korea (10 K, 2 H, 2 BB, 0 R in 6 IP) before Norimoto was relieved. Facing South Korea again in the semifinals, he was even sharper (11 K, 0 BB, 1 HB, 1 H in 7 IP). He did not give up a hit until Keun-woo Jeong singled in the seventh inning and had the most whiffs in a game for the first Premier 12 ever.[46] Norimoto relieved with a 3–0 lead but he and two other relievers combined to allow four in the 9th to blow it as Japan fell in a shocking defeat. He tied for the event lead in ERA and led in strikeouts while allowing the lowest average by a starting pitcher. He was named the All-Star SP for the event (Sho Nakata was the only other member of Samurai Japan to be picked for the All-Star team).[47]
In 104 games and 382 plate appearances in 2016, Ohtani hit 22 home runs. He also hit 18 doubles, 67 RBI, batted .322 with an OBP of .416, scored 65 runs, and had seven stolen bases. He won the Best Nine award as the designated hitter (DH).[48] Ohtani was the same dominant pitcher on the mound. In 21 games pitched, he had a career-low ERA of 1.86. He had a 10–4 record, struck out 174 batters in 140 innings with 4 complete games and one shutout. He also won the Best Nine award as a pitcher and won the Pacific League MVP. He got nearly double as many votes as any other pitcher for the PL for the 2016 NPB All-Star Game; he had 300,025 while second place Shota Takeda had 158,008.[49] He could not pitch in the event due to a blister on his finger but wound up starring as a DH.[50] In Game 1, he batted for DH Yuya Hasegawa and lined out in the 8th against Scott Mathieson. Starting at DH and hitting 5th in Game 2, he homered off Shoichi Ino in the 5th to start the PL comeback from a 3–0 deficit. He singled against Ryo Akiyoshi in the 7th and scored on a hit by Kenta Imamiya for a 4–3 lead. Coming up with a 5–4 deficit in the 8th, he singled off Shinji Tajima to bring in Shogo Akiyama with the tying run. He thus produced three of the PL's five runs in the 5–5 tie, earning him game MVP honors. He hit 102.5 mph (165 km/h) on the radar gun during the year, setting a new NPB record.[51] The record was broken by Thyago Vieira five years later, but he still holds the record for a Japanese player.
He finished the year at .322/.416/.588 with 22 home runs in 382 plate appearances on offense and a 10–4 record and a 1.86 ERA on the mound with 174 strikeouts in 140 innings. He tied for 8th in the PL in wins and was third in strikeouts (behind Norimoto and Kodai Senga).[52]
He led Nippon Ham to the 2016 Japan Series, but lost the opener to the Hiroshima Carp; he struck out 11 in 6 innings but allowed 3 runs, two on a homer by Brad Eldred and one on a steal of home by Seiya Suzuki. Down 2 games to 0, he came up big as the DH in Game 3, getting three hits, a run, and an RBI. In the bottom of the 10th, he singled off Daichi Osera score Nishikawa with the winner; Nippon Ham would take the next three games to win their second Japan Series title. Teammate Brandon Laird would win the Series MVP. Ohtani hit .375/.412/.625 with four doubles, doing more on offense than on the mound for the Series.[53]
He made the Best Nine as the top pitcher and top DH in the PL. He became the first player to receive the awards as both a pitcher and a hitter.[54] He topped four-time Cuban MVP Alfredo Despaigne easily at DH (190 votes to 47; three others combined for eight votes) but the vote at pitcher was closer (he had 111 of 245 votes, Ishikawa 69 and Tsuyoshi Wada 61). He was the runaway winner of the 2016 Pacific League Most Valuable Player Award, getting 253 of 254 first-place votes (Naoki Miyanishi got the other one) and one second-place vote. He had 1,268 vote points, to 298 for runner-up Laird.[55]
In 2017, he played in 65 games, hitting .332 with eight homers and 31 RBIs while posting a 3–2 record, a 3.20 ERA, and 29 strikeouts as a pitcher.[56] In September, it was revealed that Ohtani would ask to be posted at the end of the season to play in Major League Baseball in 2018. However, before that could happen, he had surgery on his right ankle in early October. The injury had originally occurred in the 2016 Japan Series and had cost him a chance to play in the 2017 World Baseball Classic in addition to restricting his playing time during the season.[57][58] On November 21, 2017, MLB and NPB came to a posting agreement for Ohtani.[59]
Because he was under 25 years old, Ohtani was subjected to international signing rules. This capped his bonus at $3.557 million and limited him to a rookie salary scale, while the signing team also had to pay a $20 million posting fee to the Fighters. Ohtani narrowed his finalists to seven teams, signing with the Angels for a $2.315 million bonus.[60]
On December 9, 2017, Ohtani signed his deal with the Los Angeles Angels.[61] On December 13, it was revealed that he had been diagnosed with a first-degree UCL sprain in his right elbow and received a platelet-rich plasma injection to treat the injury.[62]
Ohtani's debut MLB spring training in 2018 was disastrous and the majority of American news sources were extremely disappointed, concluding that he could not accomplish even one of his two-way abilities.[63][64][65][66][67] Over two spring games against major leaguer batters, in just 2.2 innings pitching he gave up three home runs[63] and had a 27.00 earned run average[66][67] (average ERA for MLB pitchers was 4.14 that year). He completed his five spring training games, three against minor leaguers, with an 11.70 ERA[66] in pitching, and with 4 hits in 32 at bats,[68][63] for a slashline of .125/.222/.125[69][63] (avg/obp/slg, average of .248/.318/.409 for MLB batters that year). Several major newspapers suggested he needed plenty of Triple-A minor league appearances before starting for the Angels.[70][71][69][72] By the end of Ohtani's impressive 2018 MLB regular season, the American media admitted they wrote off Ohtani far too early.[63][69]
Before the start of the season, the Angels announced that they would use him as both a hitter and a pitcher.[73] Ohtani started as the designated hitter on Opening Day, March 29, against the Oakland Athletics, singling in his first at-bat off of Kendall Graveman.[74] On April 1, he made his pitching debut, striking out six batters in six innings while allowing three runs, to pick up his first MLB win.[75] On April 3, Ohtani hit his first MLB home run, a 397-foot three-run homer against Josh Tomlin.[76] On April 6, he hit his third home run in three days, becoming the first Angels rookie to do so.[77] In only his second start on the mound on April 8, Ohtani took a perfect game through 6⅓ innings before allowing a hit. Overall, Ohtani pitched seven scoreless innings while striking out 12.[78] On June 8, he was placed on the injured list for the first time in his MLB career due to a Grade 2 UCL sprain in his right elbow. He received platelet-rich plasma and stem-cell injections to treat the injury.[79]
Ohtani was activated from the injured list as a hitter on July 2[80] and on August 3, hit two home runs against the Cleveland Indians, marking his first career multiple-home run game and his first two home runs in a road game.[81] After not pitching for 11 weeks, Angels manager Mike Scioscia announced that Ohtani would start the game against the Houston Astros on September 2.[82] However, hampered by a tight back and sore finger he only lasted 2+1⁄3 innings in the game.[83]
Ohtani ended his first major league season with a batting average of .285, a .361 on-base-percentage, 22 home runs, 61 RBIs, and 10 stolen bases. In 10 starts on the mound, he notched a 4–2 record with a 3.31 ERA, 1.16 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP), and 63 strikeouts.[84] His .564 slugging percentage ranked seventh overall among MLB players with at least 350 plate appearances for this season. He became the second-fastest Angels rookie to reach 20 home runs, and he joined Babe Ruth as the only MLB players with 10 pitching appearances and 20 homers in a season.[85] He also won the American League Rookie of the Month award twice; in April and in September.[86]
On September 3, it was revealed that Ohtani would undergo Tommy John surgery, after an MRI showed new damage to his UCL.[87] He underwent the surgery on October 1.[84] On November 12, he was named the American League Rookie of the Year.[88]
On May 7, 2019, Ohtani played in his first game with the Angels since undergoing Tommy John surgery, batting as a designated hitter against the Detroit Tigers.[89] In a June 13 game against the Tampa Bay Rays, he became the first Japanese-born player to hit for the cycle in MLB history.[90] On September 12, his season prematurely ended after it was revealed that he needed surgery to repair a bipartite patella. He finished the season batting .286/.343/.505 with 18 home runs, 62 RBIs, and 12 stolen bases in 106 games.[91]
The 2020 MLB season did not start until July 24 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[92] On July 24, Ohtani was the first ever automatic player on second base in an official MLB game at the start of the 10th inning as part of one of the new 2020 MLB season rules in a game against the Oakland Athletics. He was thrown out in a rundown.[93] On July 26, Ohtani returned to the mound against the Oakland Athletics, making his first pitching appearance since September 2018. He allowed five runs and was removed from the mound without recording an out, starting his season with a loss and an infinite ERA.[94] After his second start he began to experience discomfort in his right arm, and it was eventually revealed that he had a flexor strain in his right elbow after undergoing an MRI.[95] He was shut down from pitching for the rest of the season.[96]
On the offensive side, Ohtani finished the season batting .190/.291/.366 with seven home runs, 24 RBIs, and seven stolen bases in 43 games.[97] The culmination of experiencing injuries in his 2019 and 2020 campaigns led to Ohtani describing feeling ""frustrated"" and ""useless"". He went on to say that while his 2019 had been disappointing, his 2020 had been ""more like pathetic"" because he could not pitch or hit the way he wanted to. Ohtani said, ""[Until 2019], I could more or less do the things I wanted to do. I'd pretty much never experienced the feeling of wanting to do something but being completely unable to do it.""[98]
After the results of the 2019 and 2020 seasons, Ohtani spent the offseason overhauling himself.[98][99] He adjusted his diet,[98][99] threw bullpen sessions earlier than usual and took batting practice against live pitching, an offseason first for him.[98][99] He also embraced data and technology to optimize his training and recovery and also tinkered with a changeup.[98] Furthermore, in spring training, the Angels and Ohtani agreed to allow him to play without limitations or restrictions and drop the ""Ohtani Rules"",[100] a plan the Angels mirrored from Ohtani's schedule in Japan and had implemented since his 2018 rookie season that restricted his usage to a schedule of pitching once a week and hitting only three to four times between starts.[99]
On February 8, Ohtani agreed to a two-year $8.5 million contract with the Angels, avoiding arbitration.[101]  On June 23, he hit for himself as a pitcher and the second batter in the lineup with designated hitter rules in place, making it the first time in MLB history that an American League team chose not to use a DH while a National League team used one.[102] On July 7, he hit his 32nd home run of the year, a solo shot off of Boston Red Sox starter Eduardo Rodríguez, passing Hideki Matsui's mark in 2004, for the most home runs hit during a season by a Japanese-born player in MLB.[103] Ohtani became the first player to be selected as an All-Star as both a position player and a pitcher.[104] Ohtani participated in the 2021 Home Run Derby on July 12. He lost to Juan Soto in the first round, but set a record for the most home runs in the Derby of at least 500 feet with six.[105] 
In the All-Star Game, he was the starting pitcher and leadoff designated hitter for the American League.[106]
On July 26, in his 15th pitching start of the season against the Colorado Rockies, Ohtani became the first pitcher in league history to register 100 strikeouts while holding a major-league-leading 35 home runs before the end of July, as no pitcher had ever recorded triple-digit strikeouts and added more than nine home runs in the same season.[107] Additionally, in the same game, Ohtani became the first pitcher to throw a scoreless top half and record a hit, a RBI, a stolen base and a scored run while playing in an AL ballpark since Luis Tiant did so for the Minnesota Twins on April 26, 1970.[108]
Ohtani would finish the month of July as the first player in Major League history to ever have at least 37 home runs and 15 stolen bases before the end of July.[109] And for the second straight month, Ohtani also earned his second American League Player of the Month Award, becoming the first back-to-back Player of the Month Award winner in either league since Chase Headley in August and September 2012, and the first in the AL since Josh Hamilton in 2012. For July, he produced nine home runs, 19 RBIs, 16 walks, and a .282/.396/.671 slash line in 23 games at the plate, and a 1.35 ERA with 17 strikeouts and one walk in 20 innings.[110]
On August 18, Ohtani hit his 40th of the year, becoming the first left-handed batter in Angels history to reach 40 home runs, surpassing lefty Reggie Jackson's 1982 record of 39.[111] He capped off the month of August by stealing his 20th base in a game on August 28 against the San Diego Padres, becoming the first Japanese-born player[112] and the first player in Angels history to hit 40 home runs and have 20 stolen bases in the same season. He joined Alex Rodriguez in 2007 and Ken Griffey Jr. in 1999 as the 3rd AL player to accomplish this feat before September. He also became the first AL player to reach both of those totals in a season since Curtis Granderson in 2011.[113]
From September 22 to 25, Ohtani drew 13 walks in a 4-game span, tying an AL/NL record set by Babe Ruth in 1930, Bryce Harper in 2016, and Yasmani Grandal in 2021. He drew a career-high four walks on September 22 and three walks on September 23, against the Houston Astros, followed by four more walks on September 24 and two walks on September 25 against the Seattle Mariners.[114] His 11 walks drawn in the three-game span also tied the MLB record set by Harper in 2016.[115]
On September 26, Ohtani reached the 150-strikeout milestone against the Seattle Mariners and finished the year unbeaten at home, going 6–0 with a 1.95 ERA in 13 starts. Ohtani's home ERA was the lowest by an Angels starter since Jered Weaver in 2011. He also became the sixth starter in AL or NL history to make at least 13 home starts without a losing decision and an ERA below 2.00 in a season.[116] In the last game of the season against the Seattle Mariners, he passed teammate Mike Trout's 45 home runs in a single season to finish with the second-most home runs in a season in Angels history at 46, trailing only Troy Glaus' 47 home runs in 2000.[117]
For the year, Ohtani finished his pitching campaign by making 23 starts on the mound, going 9–2 with a 3.18 ERA, 156 strikeouts, 1.09 WHIP, and 44 walks in 130 1/3 innings.[117] On the hitting side, Ohtani finished with an American League-leading 20 intentional walks, which was the most by an AL player since Trout in 2018. Ohtani, who batted .257/.372/.592, including 46 home runs — runner-up for the MLB lead in homers, 100 RBI, 103 runs, and 26 steals in 155 games and 639 plate appearances, hit several milestones to close his season, reaching both 100 RBIs and 100 runs for the first time in his career. He also tied for the MLB lead with eight triples to go along with 26 stolen bases. Ohtani became the first player in MLB history to have at least 45 homers, 25 stolen bases, 100 RBIs, 100 runs, and eight triples in a season and the second player in AL history to record at least 45 homers and 25 stolen bases in a season, joining Jose Canseco in 1998.[117] He led the league with a wins above replacement (WAR) value of 9.1 and finished third in home runs (46), fourth in slugging percentage (.592), fifth in OPS (.965), first in triples (eight), fifth in drawing walks (96), eighth in stolen bases (26), second in extra-base hits (80), second in intentional walks (20), fifth in OPS+ (158), and first in power-speed number (33.2).[118]
Ohtani was unanimously voted the American League Most Valuable Player, becoming the 23rd pitcher and first designated hitter to win the award.[119] For the 2021 All-MLB Team, Ohtani is the only player to be named to both teams, first team and second team, in the same season (as a designated hitter and starting pitcher respectively).[120] He became the first pitcher, the first Japanese player and the first Angels player to win the Edgar Martínez Outstanding Designated Hitter Award.[121] Ohtani was also awarded the Silver Slugger Award for being the best offensive player at the designated hitter position in the American League,[122] and was named to Time 100's list of most influential people of 2021,[123] which culminated to many end-of-the-season-accolades. He was named Associated Press AP Athlete of the Year,[124] Sporting News Athlete of the Year,[125] Baseball Digest Player of the Year[126] and Baseball America Major League Player of the Year.[127] From his MLB peers he was given Sporting News Player of the Year Award,[128] Players Choice Player of the Year Award, and Players Choice American League Outstanding Player Award.[129] He was also named as both the team's Los Angeles Angels Player of the Year of 2021 and the team's Nick Adenhart Pitcher of the Year Award, as voted by his teammates.[130]
Additionally, Ohtani's 2021 season was recognized for two Guinness World Records titles: (1) the first MLB player to achieve 100+ innings and record 100+ strikeouts as a pitcher, and 100+ RBIs, hits and runs as a batter in a single season and (2) the first player to start the MLB All-Star Game as a pitcher and a designated hitter.[131] He also became the 16th recipient of the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award, awarded by Commissioner Rob Manfred,[132] who formally recognized Ohtani's 2021 season as ""historically significant"" and ""unprecedented"", calling it ""so special that it was important to recognize the historic achievement that took place in 2021 with an award just about 2021.""[132] Ohtani was offered Japan's national honor, the People's Honor Award, by the Prime Minister of Japan in recognition of his accomplishments, but Ohtani rejected it, saying it was ""still too early"" for such an award.[133] On December 22, The Sporting News released the article ""The 50 greatest seasons in sports history, ranked"". In it, Ohtani's 2021 season was ranked No.1, topping great seasons by athletes such as Babe Ruth, Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, and Lionel Messi.[134]
On March 22, 2022, Major League Baseball introduced a new rule that allows for a pitcher in the batting order to remain in the game as a designated hitter after they are pulled from the pitching mound, colloquially dubbed the ""Ohtani rule"".[135] The Angels named him as the Opening Day starting pitcher[136] and he pitched 4+2⁄3 innings against the Houston Astros, allowing one earned run and one walk while striking out nine.[137] He became the first player in MLB history to start Opening Day as both the starting pitcher and the leadoff hitter.[138]
Ohtani recorded two home runs, including a grand slam, on May 9, against the Tampa Bay Rays, marking the second time of the season and the eighth time in his career for Ohtani to record a multi-homer game, surpassing Ichiro Suzuki for the most by a Japanese-born player in MLB history,[139] The grand slam was the first of his professional career, including both NPB and MLB.[140] On May 14, he hit his 100th career MLB home run, making him the third Japanese-born player with at least 100 homers in the majors, trailing only Hideki Matsui with 175 and Suzuki with 117. Ohtani also joined Babe Ruth as the only players with at least 100 home runs and at least 250 strikeouts as a pitcher.[141]
On June 9, Ohtani hit a go-ahead two-run home run and pitched seven innings, including throwing a 101 mph fastball to strike out Rafael Devers to end the third – the hardest strikeout pitch of his career, in a win over the Boston Red Sox to end the Angels' 14-game losing streak, the longest in franchise history.[142] The victory resulted in a six-game pitching span from June 9 to July 13, where Ohtani went 6–0 with a 0.45 ERA (39.2 IP & 2 ER) and 58 strikeouts, (while also hitting eight HR with a .997 OPS), while becoming the fourth pitcher all-time to go 6–0 with 58+ SO and 2-or-fewer ER in a six-game span, joining Cy Young winners Johan Santana (2004), R.A. Dickey (2012) and Clayton Kershaw (2014).[143]
In a two-game span from June 21–22, 2022, Ohtani made MLB history by becoming the first player in the American League or National League to have at least eight RBIs in a game and strike out at least 10 batters the next day.[144] On June 21, Ohtani hit a pair of three-run homers and set a career-high with eight RBIs, becoming the first player born in Japan to have eight RBIs in a game and just the eighth player in Angels history to have eight RBIs in a game. Ohtani's eight RBIs were the most by an Angels player since Garret Anderson had a franchise-record 10 RBIs against the New York Yankees on August 21, 2007. It was also the most RBIs in a game by a Japanese-born player, surpassing seven-RBI games from Matsui in 2009 and Tadahito Iguchi in 2006.[145]
On July 6, 2022, against the Miami Marlins, Ohtani made MLB history again by becoming the first player since RBI became an official statistic in 1920 to record 10 strikeouts as a pitcher, two RBIs as a batter, and a stolen base all in a single game.[146] His 111 strikeouts over 81 innings pitched in the game made him the first Angels pitcher to record 110 K's in the first half in fewer than 100 innings and the first Angels pitcher to 110 K's in the first half since Garrett Richards in 2014. He also became the fourth Angels player with multiple seasons of 15 home runs and 10 stolen bases before the All-Star break and the eighth Major Leaguer since earned runs were official in 1913 to record 40-plus strikeouts and zero earned runs in a four-start span.[146]
For a second straight year, Ohtani was voted into All-Star Game by fans as the starter at the designated hitter position[147] and he was selected as a starting pitcher again.[148] Ohtani announced; however, that he would only participate as a hitter in the All-Star Game, even though he was considered as a candidate to start for the AL team. He declined to pitch, citing a scheduling conflict and his preference to ""prioritize the season over the All-Star Game.""[149]
In a game against the Oakland Athletics where he pitched and hit, Ohtani completed three historical feats on August 9, 2022. Ohtani joined Babe Ruth in an exclusive 10-homer, 10-win club; moved up on the all-time home run list for Japanese-born players; and set a single-season career high in strikeouts. Ohtani tossed six scoreless innings to earn his 10th win of the season for the first time in his Major League career. He and Ruth are the only two players in AL and NL history to win at least 10 games on the mound and hit at least 10 home runs in the same season. Ed Rile and Bullet Rogan also accomplished this feat in the Negro leagues as well. Ohtani's 25th home run of the season was his 118th career home run, which surpassed Ichiro Suzuki's 117 career home runs to become second place on the all-time Major League home run list for Japanese-born players. Ohtani's five strikeouts in the game brought him to 157 on the season, a new single-season high eclipsing his 2021 total of 156. Combined with his playing days in Nippon Professional Baseball, Ohtani reached 1,000 strikeouts between NPB (624) and MLB (379).[150]
The Angels avoided arbitration with Ohtani on October 1, signing him to a one-year deal worth $30 million for the 2023 season. At $30 million, the deal set a new record for a player in his third year of arbitration, surpassing the $27 million Mookie Betts received before the 2020 season, and also gave Ohtani the biggest salary raise of any arbitration-eligible player (Juan Soto later broke it with $30.1 million); a $24.5 million raise from his 2022 salary of $5.5 million and $3 million of 2021.[151]
Ohtani finished his 2022 season with a 15–9 record, a 2.33 ERA, and 219 strikeouts in 166 innings. He also hit .273/.356/.519 with 34 homers, 30 doubles, 11 stolen bases, and 95 RBIs in 157 games. Among AL pitchers, Ohtani finished the year first in SO/9 innings rate (11.87), third in strikeouts (219), fourth in ERA (2.33) and tied for fourth in wins (15), while amongst AL hitters, Ohtani ranked fourth in homers (34), fifth in OPS (.875), fifth in total bases (304), third in intentional walks (14), tied for third in extra-base hits (70), fifth in slugging (.519), tied for fourth in triples (6), seventh in RBIs (95), seventh in walks (72), and tied for eighth in runs (90).[6] Ohtani also led the majors with a home-to-first average time of 4.09 seconds[152]  and was the only player in the majors to tally at least six triples and 34 home runs in 2022 (making him the only player to do so in a second consecutive year).[143] He hit a ball with the highest exit velocity in major league baseball for the season, at 119.1 mph.[153]
He was once again named as both the team's Los Angeles Angels Player and Pitcher of the Year,[151] won a second straight Edgar Martínez Outstanding Designated Hitter Award,[154] and was runner-up for the American League Most Valuable Player Award.[155]
Fresh off being named the Most Valuable Player of the 2023 World Baseball Classic, Ohtani made his second straight Opening Day start for the Angels' while batting third in the lineup against the Athletics on March 30.[156] On May 10, he struck out Jeremy Peña of the Astros for his 502nd career pitching strikeout, passing Babe Ruth on the all-time strikeout list. With the feat, he also set the record for most pitching strikeouts by a player with 100 home runs.[157]
Ohtani was named AL Player of the Week for the fifth time in his career after hitting six home runs, going .435 (10-for-23), 12 RBIs, 10 walks and a 1.893 OPS over seven games from June 12 to 18, 2023, at the plate and picking up a win as starting pitcher on June 15, 2023, against the Texas Rangers. At the time, he was leading MLB in homers (24), RBIs (58), and total bases (175) while slashing .300/.384/.632 .[158] The honor would also 
tie him with Suzuki for the most by a Japanese-born player.[159]
Ohtani would finish the month of June by winning his sixth career AL Player of the Week award, surpassing Suzuki for the most by a Japanese-born player, after hitting six home runs with a 1.783 OPS over a seven-day span from June 26 to July 2, 2023, including a career-long 493-foot home run, the longest homer in the 2023 MLB season;[160] as well as winning his third career American League Player of the Month for June.[161] His performance in June was considered to be the best June in MLB history, as over 126 plate appearances, he batted .394 and led the major leagues in on-base percentage (.492), slugging percentage (.952), OPS (1.444), home runs (15), RBIs (29), extra-base hits (25) and total bases (99). He also threw 30⅓ sterling innings, with a 3.26 ERA, 37 strikeouts, and an opponent slash line of .228/.302/.368 as a starting pitcher.[162][163]
Ohtani earned an automatic spot on the 2023 All-Star roster after being the leading vote-getter in the American League All-Star ballot during Phase 1 of fan voting, received 2,646,307 votes as the starter in the DH position.[164] He was also elected as an All-Star pitcher for the American League, making it the third straight year Ohtani was named an All-Star as both a pitcher and a DH.[165] He would enter the All-Star Game with 30+ homers for the second time in his career, having hit 33 previously in 2021. Like 2022, Ohtani opted to participate only as a hitter in the All-Star Game and not pitch due to a blister.[166]
On July 27, Ohtani pitched a complete-game shutout during game one of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers, recording his first complete game (and shutout) of his MLB career. He struck out eight batters and walked three, allowing just one single. He later went on to hit two home runs during game two.[167] For July, Ohtani earned his seventh career AL Player of the Week award[168] and fourth career American League Player of the Month.[169]
Ohtani recorded his second career grand slam and his 43rd home run in a loss against the Rays on August 19.[170] On August 23, he hit his 44th home run of the 2023 season but was removed from his start against the Cincinnati Reds after 1⅓ inning after experiencing what was initially reported as arm fatigue. It was later revealed that Ohtani would not pitch for the rest of the 2023 season and the 2024 season after suffering a ulnar collateral ligament tear in his right elbow. He finished his 2023 season on the mound with a 10–5 record, posting a 3.14 ERA and striking out 167 batters.[171] On September 16, he was ruled out for the remainder of the season after suffering an oblique strain. He received elbow surgery performed by Dr. Neal ElAttrache on September 19, 2023, to address the UCL tear in his right elbow.[172]
In 135 games as a hitter, he batted .304/.412/.654 with 44 home runs, 95 RBI, and 20 stolen bases.[173] Ohtani ended the 2023 regular season as the first Japanese-born player to lead a U.S. major league in home runs, capturing the American League title with 44 home runs.[174] Ohtani led the league with a wins above replacement (WAR) value of 10.1, slugging percentage (.654), OPS (1.066), adjusted OPS+ (184), offensive win percentage (.810), and finished second in on-base percentage (.416), fourth in home runs (44), ninth in batting average (.304), fifth in triples (eight), second in intentional walks (21), second in adjusted batting wins (5.8), second in adjusted batting runs (60), fifth in extra-base hits (78), fifth in runs created (138), and tenth in walks (91).[118]
For the second time in his career, Ohtani was unanimously voted the American League Most Valuable Player, becoming the first player in MLB history to win MVP by unanimous vote twice.[7] He was also named to the 2023 All-MLB Team, becoming the first player to ever be named to both first teams in the same season (as a designated hitter and starting pitcher respectively).[175] He won his third straight Edgar Martínez Outstanding Designated Hitter Award,[176] his second Silver Slugger Award for being the best offensive player at the designated hitter position in the American League,[177] and his first career AL Hank Aaron Award.[178] For the third straight year, the Angels announced that Ohtani was once again the team's Los Angeles Angels Player of the Year of 2023, as voted by his teammates.[179] Ohtani won his second Associated Press AP Athlete of the Year, joining a group of 11 male athletes to have received the honor multiple times,[180] and his second Baseball America Major League Player of the Year honor.[181] From his MLB peers, he was awarded his second Players Choice American League Outstanding Player Award.[182] Ohtani's contract expired after the 2023 season and he became a free agent for the first time in his career.[183]
On December 11, 2023, Ohtani signed a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the largest contract in professional sports history at the time.[8] His wages were structured so that $68 million per season was deferred until after the deal's conclusion, to be paid out from 2034 to 2043.[184] This meant that Ohtani would only receive $2 million per season from 2024 to 2033.[185]
Because of his elbow injury and consequent surgery in September 2023, Ohtani and the Dodgers announced that he would not pitch in the 2024 season.[186] Ohtani debuted with the Dodgers as the designated hitter on March 20 against the San Diego Padres in Seoul, as part of the MLB Seoul Series.[187] He hit his first home run as a Dodger against the San Francisco Giants on April 3, six years to the day after his first Major League home run.[188][189] On April 21, Ohtani hit the 176th home run of his career, passing Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japanese player in MLB history,[190] and hit his 200th on July 13.[191] In the All-Star Game, he hit a three-run home run in the top of the third, scoring the National League's only runs and making him the first and only All-Star player with a win on the mound and a home run at the plate.[192][193]
On August 3, Ohtani joined the 30–30 club—30 home runs and 30 steals in a season—in his 108th game, becoming the third-fastest player in Major League history to do so.[194] On August 23, Ohtani stole second base in the fourth inning and hit his first career walk-off home run: a grand slam off Colin Poche of the Tampa Bay Rays. His performance made him the fastest player to join the 40–40 club, accomplishing the feat in his 126th game of the season, beating Alfonso Soriano's 2006 record by 21 games.[195] 
In his September 19 game against the Miami Marlins, Ohtani set multiple MLB and Dodgers franchise records. Ohtani had six hits—a single, two doubles, and three home runs, for 10 RBI—and stole two bases in six at-bats.[196]
He became the first and only player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a single season. He also became the 16th player in MLB history to reach 10 or more RBI in a single game, and the first since July 7, 2018.[196][197][198][199] He broke the Dodgers records for RBI in a game, passing James Loney and Gil Hodges (9),[200] and home runs in a season, passing Shawn Green (49).[201] Multiple media outlets and sports reporters called it ""one of the greatest"" single-game performances in history.[202] On September 27, Ohtani became the first player in 23 years to tally 400 total bases in season, and next day, he broke Ichiro's record for most stolen bases in season by a Japanese-born player with 57.[203][204] Ohtani finished the season by playing in 159 games, with a .310 batting average, and a league leading 54 home runs and 130 RBI while stealing 59 bases.[205]
Ohtani made his postseason debut on October 5, in Game 1 of the National League Division Series, hitting a game-tying three-run home run in his second at-bat.[206][207]  He had four hits in 20 at-bats in that series while striking out 10 times.[208]  In the National League Championship Series against the New York Mets, he performed better, with eight hits and two home runs in 22 at-bats to go along with nine walks and only seven strikeouts.[209] His 17 times reaching base and nine runs scored in the series both set new franchise records for a postseason series.[210] The Dodgers claimed the National League pennant with the series win, sending the team and Ohtani to the World Series, the first such appearance for him in his career.[211] In Game 2 of the World Series, Ohtani suffered what was initially described as a left shoulder subluxation when he slid into second base on an attempted steal in the seventh inning.[212] Despite the injury, he was back in the Dodgers lineup the following game.[213] He had only two hits in 19 at-bats in the series, with a double, two walks and five strikeouts.[214] The Dodgers defeated the New York Yankees in five games, giving Ohtani his first career World Series championship.[215] After the season, it was revealed that the injury he suffered in Game 2 of the World Series was actually a torn labrum in his left shoulder, for which he underwent surgery upon the conclusion of the series.[216]
After the 2024 season, with his 50–50 performance, Ohtani won the National League Most Valuable Player award unanimously.[217][218] It was his third career unanimous MVP award, second consecutive unanimous MVP award, and his first in the National League.[219][218] With this distinction, he became the first and only player in Major League Baseball history to win three MVP awards unanimously, two consecutive unanimous MVP awards, and unanimous MVP awards in both the American and National leagues.[220] Additionally, he became the second player after Frank Robinson to win MVP awards in both leagues.[221] On December 23, Ohtani won his third AP Male Athlete of the Year award, tying Michael Jordan for the second-most wins in history.[222]
Ohtani started his second year with the Dodgers as the designated hitter on March 18 against the Chicago Cubs in Tokyo, as part of the MLB Tokyo Series 2025, batting 2–for–5 with a double in his first game playing in Japan as a Major Leaguer.[223] On May 30, against the Yankees, he tied the Dodgers record for home runs in a month with 15.[224] In that same game, Ohtani and Aaron Judge became the first reigning MVPs ever to each hit a home run in the first inning of the same game.[225] Ohtani was named the NL Player of the Month in May 2025, after slashing .309/.398/.782, with 15 home runs on the month.[226] On June 15, Ohtani hit two home runs against the San Francisco Giants, the second being the 250th home run of his career.[227] Ohtani made his first pitching appearance as a Dodger, and first since August 2023, on June 16 against the Padres,[228] pitching one inning while allowing one run on two hits.[229]
On June 26, Ohtani was announced as a starting designated hitter for the NL in the All-Star Game, having received the second most votes behind Judge.[230] Ohtani topped the National League and was second in the big leagues with 3.97 million votes, becoming the first designated hitter to start in five straight All-Star Games.[231]  On July 23, Ohtani hit a home run in the first inning against the Minnesota Twins, tying a franchise record by homering in his fifth straight game.[232] On August 6, Ohtani recorded his 1,000th career hit when he hit a two-run home run off Cardinals pitcher Matthew Liberatore in the third inning. He became the third Japanese-born player to reach 1,000 hits in the Majors, joining Ichiro Suzuki (3,089) and Hideki Matsui (1,253).[233] Ohtani hit his 40th home run on August 9 against the Toronto Blue Jays in the fifth inning, marking his third consecutive season and fourth overall in which he achieved this. He became the fourth Dodger with multiple seasons with at least 40 homers, joining Duke Snider (5 from 1953-57), Gil Hodges (2 from 1951 and '54), and Shawn Green (2 from 2001-02).[234] On September 16, Ohtani pitched five no-hit innings and struck out two batters against the Phillies, then hit his 50th home run in the eighth inning. With that performance, he became the first player with 50 home runs in back-to-back seasons since Alex Rodriguez in 2001-02 and the sixth player all-time to reach that milestone; he also became the first in MLB history to hit 50 homers and record 50 strikeouts as a pitcher in a single season.[235] On September 23, Ohtani pitched six scoreless innings while striking out eight batters against the Arizona Diamondbacks in his 100th career start as a pitcher. With his performance, he joined Babe Ruth to have started 100 games as a pitcher and hit at least 55 career home runs.[236] On September 26, Ohtani stole his 20th base of the year, becoming the first player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 20 bases in two separate seasons.[237] On September 28, Ohtani hit his 55th home run in the seventh inning against the Seattle Mariners, setting a new career-high and passing his single-season franchise record with that homer in the Dodgers' final regular-season game.[238]
Ohtani finished the 2025 season batting .282 with 55 home runs, 102 RBI and 20 stolen bases. He led the National League with 146 runs scored, 380 total bases, 89 extra-base hits, and a 1.014 OPS. He also recorded a career-high 109 walks to become the first player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs, draw 100 walks, and steal 20 bases in one season. As a pitcher, he posted a 1–1 record with a 2.87 ERA in 14 games while striking out 62 batters in 47 innings.[239][240]
In Game 1 of the Wild Card Series against the Cincinnati Reds, Ohtani hit two home runs as he became the second player with two 113-mile-per-hour (182 km/h) home runs in a postseason game in the Statcast era (since 2015), joining Giancarlo Stanton in Game 2 of the 2025 AL Wild Card Series. It was also Ohtani's first multi-homer game in the postseason.[241] Ohtani then made his first career postseason start in the opening game of the Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, striking out nine while allowing three runs on three hits and one walk in six innings, to earn the win.[242] Ohtani's next start on the mound was in Game 4 of the 2025 NLCS against the Milwaukee Brewers, where he set multiple MLB records and helped the Dodgers sweep the series and advance to the 2025 World Series. Ohtani struck out 10 batters in 6+ scoreless innings and also hit three home runs in three at-bats, becoming the first pitcher in history to do so. He led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run, becoming the first pitcher to hit a leadoff homer in any MLB game. He also became the first pitcher with multiple home runs in a postseason game.[243] Several sportswriters considered Ohtani's performance in Game 4 as one of the greatest of all time, for which he received the NLCS MVP Award.[244][245][246][247]
In Game 1 of the World Series, Ohtani hit a two-run home run in the top of the seventh inning, it was his sixth homer of the postseason and the first World Series home run of his career,[248] joining Hideki Matsui (2003) as the only Japanese-born player to hit a home run in a World Series.[249] In Game 3 of the World Series, Ohtani recorded four hits—two doubles and two home runs—and drew five walks, four of which were intentional, setting multiple MLB postseason records.[250][251] Ohtani reached base nine times—a postseason record—and tied Stan Hack (1942), Johnny Burnett (1932) and Max Carey (1922) for the all-time MLB record. He recorded four extra-base hits in his four at-bats, joining Frank Isbell (1906) for the most in a World Series game.[250][252] He became the first player with three multi-home run games as well as multiple games with at least 12 total bases in a single postseason.[253] He also became the first player to be intentionally walked four times in a postseason game.[254]
Ohtani was selected to Japan's national under-18 team that eventually finished in sixth place at the 2012 U-18 Baseball World Cup in Seoul.[255]
In the inaugural WBSC Premier12 tournament, Ohtani earned a bronze medal with the Japanese national team. He was the ace of Japan's pitching staff, which also featured Kenta Maeda. Ohtani made two pitching appearances for Samurai Japan, both against Japan's arch-rival South Korea, winning Game 1 of the opening round and getting a no-decision in the semifinals. Ohtani was subsequently named to the Premier12 All-World Team and was named the 2015 WBSC Baseball Player of the Year.[256]
Ohtani was on Japan's 28-man roster for the 2017 World Baseball Classic but was forced to withdraw due to an ankle injury.[257]
Ohtani played for Japan in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.[258] He was named the Pool B MVP for his hitting and pitching performances in the group stage of the tournament.[259] He earned the save in the championship game after pitching the final inning of Japan's win over the U.S., striking out then-teammate Mike Trout with a 3–2 slider to clinch Japan's WBC championship. Ohtani won the tournament's MVP award after batting .435/.606/.739 as a hitter and posting a 1.86 ERA and 11 strikeouts in 9+2⁄3 innings as a pitcher.[260]
After helping Japan clinch its third WBC title, Ohtani became the only player to be named to the All-WBC team at two separate positions, having been named to the 2023 team as both a DH and a pitcher.[261]

Ohtani is a 191-centimetre (75 in), 210-pound (95 kg) right-handed starting pitcher.[268][269] With an overhand delivery,[270] he throws a four-seam fastball averaging 97 miles per hour (156 km/h)[269] topping out at 102.5 mph (165 km/h),[271] an 86–93-mile-per-hour (138–150 km/h) forkball/split-finger fastball[272][273] with late diving action,[274] an occasional curveball, and a solid slider at 85–91 miles per hour (137–146 km/h).[275] He posted a walks per nine innings rate of 3.3 across his NPB career.[32] Ohtani has been compared to Justin Verlander by some MLB scouts[276] because of his ability and affinity for throwing harder in high-leverage spots, as well as later in games.[277] Whereas most pitchers throw only a little harder in big spots than they do in normal ones and most pitchers lose speed as the game goes on, Ohtani, like Verlander, is able to reserve power and staying power in order to conserve energy without throwing max effort on every offering.[277]
Ohtani is a left-handed batter. He is a designated hitter and often considered a power hitter capable of leading the league in home runs.[118] Ohtani also demonstrates elite baserunner skills, with a sprint speed and feet-first sliding technique allowing him to have been a league leader in stolen bases, bunt hits and infield-hit rate.[277] Scouts have timed Ohtani running from the batter's box to first base in as little as 3.8 seconds.[278] For the 2021 season, his 28.8 feet per second (19.6 mph) sprint speed ranked in the 92nd percentile of all players, as did his 3.51 second 80-foot split[279] and he also recorded the fastest home to first average sprint time in the Majors at 4.09 seconds,[277][280][281] while recording a then career-high 26 stolen bases.[117]
Ohtani has been nicknamed ""Shotime"".[30]
Ohtani is one of Japan's most celebrated athletes,[14] and has faced intense media scrutiny from the Japanese press his whole adult life.[27] Due to the high-profile nature of his two-way efforts, the Fighters protected Ohtani from some of the media onslaught, while Ohtani tended to keep to the team dormitory and the gym, leading a semi-monastic, baseball-centric existence, a byproduct of holding down two jobs in the big leagues.[27]
Ohtani has a Kooikerhondje dog named Dekopin, also known as Decoy.[282] The dog received an honorary visa from the Embassy of the United States, Tokyo.[283] In connection with his $7.85 million home purchase, Ohtani established an LLC named ""Decopin"", which he named after his dog.[284][285][286]
Ohtani is married to former professional basketball player Mamiko Tanaka.[287] Ohtani announced in February 2024 that he had married but declined to disclose his wife's identity except to say, ""She's a normal Japanese woman"".[288] The next month, he revealed her identity by posting a photograph of himself with Tanaka.[287] On December 29, 2024, Ohtani announced on Instagram that they were expecting their first child.[289][290] On April 17, 2025, Ohtani returned to Los Angeles during a Dodgers road trip in anticipation of the baby's arrival. Two days later, he announced on Instagram the birth of their first child, a daughter.[291]
Ohtani has been represented by agent Nez Balelo of CAA Sports since 2017, shortly after announcing his plans to pursue an MLB career.[292] He was listed in Forbes 30 under 30 Asia class of 2018 in the field of Entertainment & Sports.[293] In 2021, Ohtani was named to Time 100's list of most influential people of 2021[123] and awarded the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award by Commissioner Rob Manfred.[132]
In 2023, Ohtani endorsement earnings were estimated to be an MLB league-leading $35–40 million, up from his MLB league-leading $20 million endorsement earnings in 2022, which tripled from his MLB league-leading $6 million endorsement earnings in 2021.[294][295] By 2025, his estimated endorsements had risen to $100 million for the year.[296] Ohtani has proven to be a hit on both sides of the Pacific, with deals with 20 companies, including New Balance and Fanatics/Topps,[297] in the U.S. and Hugo Boss, Kosé, Porsche Japan, Kowa, Mitsubishi Bank, Japan Airlines, Salesforce, Nishikawa Co., and Seiko in Japan.[298][296]
In 2022, Ohtani became a brand ambassador for Kowa, Mitsubishi Bank, Japan Airlines, Salesforce,[298] Porsche Japan as part of their 'Porsche Driving Athlete' family and Fanatics.[299][300] In 2023, Ohtani added two new deals with New Balance[301]  and Japanese cosmetics company Kosé.[302] Ohtani was the first Asian player to be a cover athlete of MLB The Show in 2022.[303][304] In 2025, Ohtani's likeness was added to Fortnite, making him the first MLB player available in the game.[305]
Ohtani's previous partnerships included Asics, Descente, Oakley, New Era, FTX, Savas, and Aquarius.[306] On November 16, 2021, it was announced that Ohtani joined cryptocurrency exchange FTX as a global ambassador,[307] partnering on various animal charitable initiatives;[308] however, in November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, wiping out billions of dollars in customer funds. Ohtani, alongside other spokespeople, was sued for promoting unregistered securities through a class-action lawsuit[309][310] with his lawyers filing for Ohtani's dismissal from the FTX lawsuit in April 2023.[311]
While not fluent, Ohtani speaks passable English as well as Spanish, but prefers to speak to the media through an interpreter.[312] Ippei Mizuhara was Ohtani's personal interpreter with the Angels and Dodgers, having known Ohtani since he was 18, starting in 2013 during Ohtani's days with the Fighters.[313] Mizuhara's role went beyond solely translating to include confidant, conditioning coach, and throwing partner.[314][315]
In March 2024, an ESPN investigation uncovered $4.5 million in wire payments from Ohtani's bank account to a Southern California bookmaking operation under federal investigation.[316][317] It was also found that, between January and March 2024, Mizuhara had purchased approximately $325,000 worth of baseball cards from online resellers such as eBay from Ohtani's bank account with the intent to resell them later for his own personal profit.[316] On March 19, Mizuhara told ESPN that the money was for repaying his gambling debts. He said he had asked Ohtani for the money and that Ohtani himself transferred the funds to the bookie. Mizuhara also told this story to the Dodgers clubhouse after a game that day. However, as ESPN prepared to air the interview on the morning of March 20, Ohtani's law firm issued a statement reading, ""We discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft, and we are turning the matter over to the authorities."" That afternoon, the Dodgers fired Mizuhara, who had signed a contract with the team when Ohtani joined.[318] Will Ireton, who had served as an interpreter for Kenta Maeda, took over as Ohtani's interpreter.[319] At a March 25 press conference, Ohtani made his first public statement about the incident, telling reporters that he had never bet on sports or had any knowledge of the debt until the team meeting on March 19.[320]
On April 11, the US Attorney for the Central District of California charged Mizuhara with one count of bank fraud after an investigation determined that he had impersonated Ohtani with his bank, had illegally changed settings on the bank account and had stolen over $16 million from that account.[321] On June 4, following Mizuhara's guilty plea, Ohtani was officially cleared of any wrongdoing in the affair.[322][323] In February 2025, Mizuhara was sentenced to repay Ohtani $17 million along with a 57-month prison sentence.[324]
On May 9, 2024, Lionsgate Television announced the development of a scripted series based on the interpreter gambling scandal.[325][326]
"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_started,Games started,"In baseball statistics, games started (denoted by GS) indicates the number of games that a pitcher has started for his team. A pitcher is credited with starting the game if he throws the first pitch to the first opposing batter. If a player is listed in the starting lineup as the team's pitcher, but is replaced before facing an opposing batter, the player is credited with a game pitched but not a game started; there have been instances in major league history in which a starting pitcher was removed before his first pitch due to an injury, perhaps suffered while batting or running the bases during the top half of the first inning. 
The all-time leader for games started is Cy Young with 815 over a 22-year career.[1] In the modern era,[2] Nolan Ryan has the most games started in a career with 773.[3] The players with the most starts in a single season are Pud Galvin and Will White, with 75 games started each. In the modern era, that record is held by Jack Chesbro, who had 51 starts in 1904.[4]
For position players, games started is also used to denote the number of times their names appear in a team's starting lineup during the season.
The statistic is also used in other sports including football and basketball.

Americans are the citizens and nationals of the United States.[18][19] U.S. federal law does not equate nationality with race or ethnicity but rather with citizenship.[20][21][22][23] The U.S. has 37 ancestry groups with more than one million individuals.[24] White Americans form the largest racial and ethnic group at 61.6% of the U.S. population, with non-Hispanic Whites making up 57.8% of the population.[25][26] Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the American population. Black Americans constitute the country's third-largest ancestry group and are 12.4% of the total U.S. population.[24] Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 6% of the American population. The country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1.1%,[24] and some 574 native tribes are recognized by the federal government.[27] People of American descent can be found internationally. As many as seven million Americans are estimated to be living abroad, and make up the American diaspora.[28][29][30]
The majority of Americans trace their roots to immigrants who arrived in what is now the United States, starting with European colonization in the 16th century. This includes diverse groups such as the English, Irish, Germans, Italians, and others, as well as Africans forcibly brought as slaves during the Atlantic slave trade. However, the Native American population, whose ancestors inhabited the continent for thousands of years before European contact, are a key exception.
Despite its multi-ethnic composition,[31][32] the culture of the United States held in common by most Americans can also be referred to as mainstream American culture, a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of Northern and Western European colonists, settlers, and immigrants.[31] It also includes significant influences of African-American culture.[33] Westward expansion integrated the French-speaking Creoles and Cajuns of Louisiana and the Hispanos of the American Southwest, who brought close contact with the culture of Mexico. Large-scale immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries from Eastern and Southern Europe introduced a variety of new customs. Immigration from Africa, Asia, and Latin America has also had impact. A cultural melting pot, or pluralistic salad bowl, describes the way in which generations of Americans have celebrated and exchanged distinctive cultural characteristics.[31]

The United States is a diverse country, both racially and ethnically.[35] Six races are officially recognized by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes: Alaska Native and American Indian, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, White, and people of two or more races. ""Some other race"" is also an option in the census and other surveys.[36][37][38]
The United States Census Bureau also classifies Americans as ""Hispanic or Latino"" and ""Not Hispanic or Latino"", which identifies Hispanic and Latino Americans as a racially diverse ethnicity that comprises the largest minority group in the nation.[36][37][38]
White Americans constitute the majority of the 331 million people living in the United States, with 204,277,273 people or 61.6% of the population in the 2020 United States census.[a][40][41] The US census defines ""white"" as ""[a] person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa"".[42] Non-Hispanic Whites, which only account for 57.8% of the population, or 191,697,647  people, are the majority in 44 states. There are six minority-majority states: California, Texas, Maryland,[43] New Mexico, Nevada, and Hawaii.[44][45] In addition, the District of Columbia and the five inhabited U.S. territories have a non-white majority.[40] The state with the highest percentage of non-Hispanic White Americans is Maine, while the state with the lowest percentage is Hawaii.[46]
Europe is the largest continent that Americans trace their ancestry to, and many claim descent from various European ethnic groups.[47]
The Spaniards were among the first Europeans to establish a continuous presence in what is now the continental United States in 1565 in San Agustín, La Florida then a part of New Spain.[48][49] Virginia Dare (b. 1587) in Roanoke Island in present-day North Carolina, was the first child born in the original Thirteen Colonies to English parents. The Spaniards also established a continuous presence in what over three centuries later would become a possession of the United States with the founding of the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1521.
In the 2020 United States census, English Americans 46.5 million (19.8%), German Americans 45m (19.1%), Irish Americans 38.6m (16.4%), and Italian Americans 16.8m (7.1%) were the four largest self-reported European ancestry groups in the United States constituting 62.4% of the white American population.[50] However, the English Americans and British Americans demography is considered a serious under-count as they tend to self-report and identify as simply ""Americans"" (since the introduction of a new ""American"" category in the 1990 census) due to the length of time they have inhabited America. This is highly over-represented in the Upland South, a region that was settled historically by the British.[51][52][53][54][55][56]
Overall, as the largest group, European Americans have the lowest poverty rate[57] and the second highest educational attainment levels, median household income,[58] and median personal income[59] of any racial demographic in the nation, second only to Asian Americans in the latter three categories.
Hispanic and Latino Americans constitute the largest ethnic minority in the United States. They form the second largest group in the United States, comprising 62,080,044 people or 18.7% of the population according to the 2020 United States census.[b][60][61]
Hispanic and Latino Americans are not considered a race in the United States census, instead forming an ethnic category.[62][63][64][65]
People of Spanish or Hispanic and Latino descent have lived in what is now United States territory since the founding of San Juan, Puerto Rico (the oldest continuously inhabited settlement on American soil) in 1521 by Juan Ponce de León, and the founding of St. Augustine, Florida (the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in the continental United States) in 1565 by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés. In the State of Texas, Spaniards first settled the region in the late 1600s and formed a unique cultural group known as Tejanos.
Black and African Americans are citizens and residents of the United States with origins in sub-Saharan Africa.[68] According to the Office of Management and Budget, the grouping includes individuals who self-identify as African American, as well as persons who emigrated from nations in the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa.[69] The grouping is thus based on geography, and may contradict or misrepresent an individual's self-identification since not all immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa are ""Black"". Among these racial outliers are persons from Cape Verde, Madagascar, various Arab states, and Hamito-Semitic populations in East Africa and the Sahel, and the Afrikaners of Southern Africa.[68] African Americans (also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans, and formerly as American Negroes) are citizens or residents of the United States who have origins in any of the black populations of Africa.[70] According to the 2020 United States census, there were 39,940,338 Black and African Americans in the United States, representing 12.4% of the population.[71][d][72] Black and African Americans make up the third largest group in the United States, after White and European Americans, and Hispanic and Latino Americans.[60] The majority of the population (55%) lives in the South; compared to the 2000 United States census, there has also been a decrease of African Americans in the Northeast and Midwest.[72]
Most African Americans are the direct descendants of captives from Central and West Africa, from ancestral populations in countries like Nigeria, Benin, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, and Angola,[73] who survived the slavery era within the boundaries of the present United States.[74] As an adjective, the term is usually spelled African-American.[75] Montinaro et al. (2014) observed that around 50% of the overall ancestry of African Americans traces back to the Niger-Congo-speaking Yoruba of southwestern Nigeria and southern Benin (before the European colonization of Africa this people created the Oyo Empire), reflecting the centrality of this West African region in the Atlantic slave trade.[76] Zakharaia et al. (2009) found a similar proportion of Yoruba associated ancestry in their African American samples, with a minority also drawn from Mandinka populations (founders of the Mali Empire),  and Bantu populations (who had a varying level of social organization during the colonial era, while some Bantu peoples were still tribal, other Bantu peoples had founded kingdoms such as the Kingdom of Kongo).[77]
The first West African slaves were brought to Jamestown, Virginia in 1619. The English settlers treated these captives as indentured servants and released them after a number of years. This practice was gradually replaced by the system of race-based slavery used in the Caribbean.[78] All the American colonies had slavery, but it was usually the form of personal servants in the North (where 2% of the people were slaves), and field hands in plantations in the South (where 25% were slaves);[79] by the beginning of the American Revolutionary War 1/5th of the total population was enslaved.[80] During the revolution, some would serve in the Continental Army or Continental Navy,[81][82] while others would serve the British Empire in the Ethiopian Regiment, and other units.[83] By 1804, the northern states (north of the Mason–Dixon line) had abolished slavery.[84] However, slavery would persist in the southern states until the end of the American Civil War and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.[85] Following the end of the Reconstruction era, which saw the first African American representation in Congress,[86] African Americans became disenfranchised and subject to Jim Crow laws,[87] legislation that would persist until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act due to the civil rights movement.[88]
According to United States Census Bureau data, very few African immigrants self-identify as African American. On average, less than 5% of African residents self-reported as ""African American"" or ""Afro-American"" on the 2000 U.S. census. The overwhelming majority of African immigrants (~95%) identified instead with their own respective ethnicities. Self-designation as ""African American"" or ""Afro-American"" was highest among individuals from West Africa (4%–9%), and lowest among individuals from Cape Verde, East Africa and Southern Africa (0%–4%).[89] African immigrants may also experience conflict with African Americans.[90]
Another significant population is the Asian American population, comprising 19,618,719 people in 2020, or 5.9% of the United States population.[e][92][93] California is home to 5.6 million Asian Americans, the greatest number in any state.[94] In Hawaii, Asian Americans make up the highest proportion of the population (57 percent).[94] Asian Americans live across the country, yet are heavily urbanized, with significant populations in the Greater Los Angeles Area, New York metropolitan area, and the San Francisco Bay Area.[95]
The United States census defines Asian Americans as those with origins to the countries of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. Although Americans with roots in West Asia were once classified as ""Asian"", they are now excluded from the term in modern census classifications.[96] The largest sub-groups are immigrants or descendants of immigrants from Cambodia, mainland China, India, Japan, Korea, Laos, Pakistan, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Asians overall have higher income levels than all other racial groups in the United States, including whites, and the trend appears to be increasing in relation to those groups.[97] Additionally, Asians have a higher education attainment level than all other racial groups in the United States.[98][99] For better or for worse, the group has been called a model minority.[100][101][102]
While Asian Americans have been in what is now the United States since before the Revolutionary War,[103][104][105] relatively large waves of Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese immigration did not begin until the mid-to-late 19th century.[105] Immigration and significant population growth continue to this day.[106] Due to a number of factors, Asian Americans have been stereotyped as ""perpetual foreigners"".[107][108]
Middle Eastern Americans and North African Americans are Americans with ancestry from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). According to the American Jewish Archives and the Arab American National Museum, the first Middle Easterners and North Africans (viz. Jews and Berbers) to arrive in the Americas landed in the late 15th to mid-16th centuries.[109][110][111][112] Many fled ethnic or ethnoreligious persecution during the Spanish Inquisition;[113][114] a few were taken to the Americas as slaves.[110]
In 2014, the United States Census Bureau began finalizing the ethnic classification of people of Middle Eastern and North African (""MENA"") origins.[115] According to the Arab American Institute (AAI), Arab Americans have family origins in each of the 22 member states of the Arab League.[116] Following consultations with MENA organizations, the Census Bureau announced in 2014 that it would establish a new MENA ethnic category for populations from the Middle East, North Africa, and the Arab world, separate from the ""white"" classification that these populations had previously sought in 1909. The groups felt that the earlier ""white"" designation no longer accurately represents MENA identity, so they successfully lobbied for a distinct categorization.[117] This new category would also include Israeli Americans.[118] The Census Bureau does not currently ask about whether one is Sikh, because it views them as followers of a religion rather than members of an ethnic group, and it does not combine questions concerning religion with race or ethnicity.[119] As of December 2015, the sampling strata for the new MENA category includes the Census Bureau's working classification of 19 MENA groups, as well as Iranian, Turkish, Armenian, Afghan, Azerbaijani, and Georgian groups.[120] In January 2018, it was announced that the Census Bureau would not include the grouping in the 2020 census.[121]
According to the 2020 United States census, there are 2,251,699 people who are Native Americans or Alaska Natives alone; they make up 0.7% of the total population.[f][125] According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), an ""American Indian or Alaska Native"" is a person whose ancestry have origins in any of the original peoples of North, Central, or South America.[125] 2.3 million individuals who are American Indian or Alaskan Native are multiracial;[125] additionally the plurality of American Indians reside in the Western United States (40.7%).[125] Collectively and historically this race has been known by several names;[126] as of 1995, 50% of those who fall within the OMB definition prefer the term ""American Indian"", 37% prefer ""Native American"" and the remainder have no preference or prefer a different term altogether.[127]
Among Americans today, levels of Native American ancestry (distinct from Native American identity) differ. Based on a sample of users of the 23andMe commercial genetic test, genomes of self-reported African Americans averaged to 0.8% Native American ancestry, those of European Americans averaged to 0.18%, and those of Latinos averaged to 18.0%.[128][129] Another genetic study focusing on Native American ancestry in the general population found an average of 38% in Latinos, 1% in African Americans, and 0.1% for European American populations, respectively.[130]
Native Americans, whose ancestry is indigenous to the Americas, originally migrated to the two continents between 10,000 and 45,000 years ago.[131] These Paleoamericans spread throughout the two continents and evolved into hundreds of distinct cultures during the pre-Columbian era.[132] Following the first voyage of Christopher Columbus,[133] the European colonization of the Americas began, with St. Augustine, Florida becoming the first permanent European settlement in the continental United States.[134] From the 16th through the 19th centuries, the population of Native Americans declined in the following ways: epidemic diseases brought from Europe;[135] genocide and warfare at the hands of European explorers, settlers and colonists,[136][137] as well as between tribes;[138][139] displacement from their lands;[140] internal warfare,[141] enslavement;[142] and intermarriage.[143][144]
As defined by the United States Census Bureau and the Office of Management and Budget, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders are ""persons having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands"".[146] Previously called Asian Pacific American, along with Asian Americans beginning in 1976, this was changed in 1997.[147] As of the 2020 United States census, there are 622,018 who reside in the United States, and make up 0.2% of the nation's total population.[g][148] 14% of the population have at least a bachelor's degree,[148] and 15.1% live in poverty, below the poverty threshold.[148] As compared to the 2000 United States census, this population grew by 40%;[146] and 71% live in the West; of those over half (52%) live in either Hawaii or California, with no other states having populations greater than 100,000. The United States territories in the Pacific also have large Pacific Islander populations such as Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands (Chammoro), and American Samoa (Samoan).[146] The largest concentration of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, is Honolulu County in Hawaii,[148] and Los Angeles County in the continental United States.[146]
The United States has a growing multiracial identity movement, and this group is one of the fastest growing demographics in the country.[149] Multiracial Americans numbered 7.0 million in 2008, or 2.3% of the population;[93] by the 2020 census the multiracial increased to 13,548,983, or 4.1% of the total population.[150] They can be any combination of races (White, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, ""some other race"") and ethnicities.[151] The largest population of Multiracial Americans were those of White and African American descent, with a total of 1,834,212 self-identifying individuals.[150] Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States, is multiracial — his mother is white (of English and Irish descent) and his father is black (of Kenyan descent) [152][153] — though he identifies only as African American.[154][155]
According to the 2020 United States census, 8.4% or 27,915,715 Americans chose to self-identify with the ""some other race"" category, the third most popular option. The vast majority of this group was Hispanic or Latino. ""Some other race"" formed the single largest racial group of Hispanics, with 42.2% of Hispanic/Latino Americans, or 26,225,882 people, choosing to identify as some other race, as these Hispanic/Latinos may feel the United States census does not describe their mixed European and American Indian ancestry as they understand it to be.[157]
A significant portion of the Hispanic and Latino population self-identifies as Mestizo, particularly the Mexican and Central American community.[158] Mestizo is not a racial category in the United States census, but signifies someone who has both European and American Indian ancestry.
Uncle Sam is a national personification of the United States and sometimes more specifically of the American government, with the first usage of the term dating from the War of 1812. He is depicted as a stern elderly white man with white hair and a goatee beard, and dressed in clothing that recalls the design elements of the flag of the United States – for example, typically a top hat with red and white stripes and white stars on a blue band, and red and white striped trousers.
Columbia is a poetic name for the Americas and the feminine personification of the United States of America, made famous by African American poet Phillis Wheatley during the American Revolutionary War in 1776. It has inspired the names of many persons, places, objects, institutions, and companies in the Western Hemisphere and beyond, including the District of Columbia, the seat of government of the United States.
English is the national language and official language of the United States at the federal level.[161] Additionally, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2020, about 245 million, or 78% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 13.4% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language.[162][163] Prior to the signing of Executive Order 14224 in March 2025, which declared English the official language of the U.S., some Americans advocated making English the country's official language, as it is in at least 30 out of the 50 states.[164] Both English and Hawaiian are official languages in Hawaii by state law.[165] Alaska has declared its 20 Native American languages to be official, along with English.[166][167] In South Dakota, both dialects of the Sioux language have been declared official, along with English.[168][169]
While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French.[170] Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents. The latter include court forms.[171] Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands; Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico.
Religion in the United States has a high adherence level compared to other developed countries and a diversity in beliefs. The First Amendment to the country's Constitution prevents the Federal government from making any ""law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"". The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this as preventing the government from having any authority in religion. A majority of Americans report that religion plays a ""very important"" role in their lives, a proportion unusual among developed countries. However, similar to the other nations of the Americas.[173] Many faiths have flourished in the United States, including both later imports spanning the country's multicultural immigrant heritage, as well as those founded within the country; these have led the United States to become the most religiously diverse country in the world.[174]
The United States has the world's largest Christian population.[175] The majority of Americans (76%) are Christians, mostly within Protestant and Catholic denominations; these adherents constitute 48% and 23% of the population, respectively.[176]  Other religions include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, which collectively make up about 4% to 5% of the adult population.[177][178][179] Another 15% of the adult population identifies as having no religious belief or no religious affiliation.[177] According to the American Religious Identification Survey, religious belief varies considerably across the country: 59% of Americans living in Western states (the ""Unchurched Belt"") report a belief in God, yet in the South (the ""Bible Belt"") the figure is as high as 86%.[177][180]
Several of the original Thirteen Colonies were established by settlers who wished to practice their religion without discrimination: the Massachusetts Bay Colony was established by English Puritans, Pennsylvania by Irish and English Quakers, Maryland by English and Irish Catholics, and Virginia by English Anglicans. Although some individual states retained established religious confessions well into the 19th century, the United States was the first nation to have no official state-endorsed religion.[181] Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, the framers of the Constitution rejected any religious test for office. The First Amendment specifically denied the federal government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise, thus protecting any religious organization, institution, or denomination from government interference. European Rationalist and Protestant ideals mainly influenced the decision. Still, it was also a consequence of the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups and small states that did not want to be under the power or influence of a national religion that did not represent them.[182]
American culture is primarily a Western culture, but is influenced by Native American, West African, Latin American, East Asian, and Polynesian cultures.
The United States of America has its own unique social and cultural characteristics, such as dialect, music, arts, social habits, cuisine, and folklore.[32]
Its chief early European influences came from English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish settlers of colonial America during British rule. British culture, due to colonial ties with Britain that spread the English language, legal system and other cultural inheritances, had a formative influence.[183] Other important influences came from other parts of Europe, especially Germany,[184] France,[185] and Italy.[186]
Original elements also play a strong role, such as Jeffersonian democracy.[187] Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia was perhaps the first influential domestic cultural critique by an American and a reaction to the prevailing European consensus that America's domestic originality was degenerate.[187] Prevalent ideas and ideals that evolved domestically, such as national holidays, uniquely American sports, military tradition,[188] and innovations in the arts and entertainment give a strong sense of national pride among the population as a whole.[189]
American culture includes both conservative and liberal elements, scientific and religious competitiveness, political structures, risk taking and free expression, materialist and moral elements. Despite certain consistent ideological principles (e.g. individualism, egalitarianism, faith in freedom and democracy), the American culture has a variety of expressions due to its geographical scale and demographic diversity.
Americans have migrated to many places around the world, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. Unlike migration from other countries, United States migration is not concentrated in specific countries, possibly as a result of the roots of immigration from so many different countries to the United States.[190] As of 2016[update], there were approximately 9 million United States citizens living outside of the United States.[191] As the result of U.S. tax and financial reporting requirements that apply to non-resident citizens, record numbers of American citizens renounced their U.S. citizenship in the decade from 2010 to 2020.[192] In 2024 a new organization was created to lobby the U.S. Congress for relief from citizenship-based taxation that is often cited as the reason for the record renunciations.[193]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Golf_Tour,Japan Golf Tour,"The Japan Golf Tour (Japanese: 日本ゴルフツアー機構) is a prominent professional golf tour. It was founded in 1973 and as of 2006, it offered the third-highest annual prize fund out of the regular (that is not for seniors) men's professional tours after the PGA Tour and the European Tour. However, since the early 1990s, the growth in prize money has not kept pace with that on the two larger tours. Official events on the Japan Golf Tour count for Official World Golf Ranking points and success on the tour can also qualify members to play in the majors.
Most of the leading players on the tour are Japanese, but players from many other countries also participate. The tour is currently run by the Japan Golf Tour Organization (JGTO), which was established in 1999 to separate the tour from the PGA of Japan.[1] The JGTO also organises a developmental tour called the Japan Challenge Tour.
Masashi Ozaki has been the dominant player on tour, leading the career wins list with 94, the career money list with over ¥2 billion and winning the money title twelve times between 1973 and 1998.[2]
Entry to The Open Championship is given to Order of Merit winner and runner-up, Japan Open Golf Championship winner, two players not already exempt from the money list up to the Japan Golf Tour Championship and the top four non-exempt players from the Mizuno Open.
In 2000, the tour signed a title sponsorship agreement with Iiyama, being renamed as the iiyama Tour. The agreement was reported to be worth ¥1,500,000,000 over three years.[3]
In 2008, the tour ventured outside of Japan for the first time, co-sanctioning the Pine Valley Beijing Open in China, alongside the Asian Tour.[4] In 2013, the tour also co-sanctioned two events at the beginning of the year in Thailand and Indonesia with the OneAsia Tour.[5][6]
In December 2022, a new agreement involving the JGTO, PGA Tour and European Tour was announced. As part of the deal, from 2023 onwards the top three on the Japan Golf Tour's season-ending money list earned status to play on the European Tour for the following season.[7][8]
The table shows the top ten career money leaders on the Japan Golf Tour through the 2021 season. The figures shown include money won in the four global major championships from 1998 onwards and in the individual World Golf Championships from 1999 to 2009.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler,Rickie Fowler,"
Rick Yutaka Fowler (born December 13, 1988) is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour. He was the number one ranked amateur golfer in the world for 36 weeks in 2007 and 2008. On January 24, 2016, he reached a career high fourth in the Official World Golf Ranking following his victory in the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship. He is one of only four golfers to shoot 62 in a major championship, achieving the feat at the 2023 U.S. Open, played at the Los Angeles Country Club.
Fowler was born and raised in Murrieta, California.[1] He attended Murrieta Valley High School. For years, he played only on a driving range and is almost entirely self-taught.[3] In his senior year in high school, Fowler won the SW League Final with a total score of 64-69=133 and led his team to the state final in 2007.
After high school, Fowler attended Oklahoma State University in Stillwater. He posted his first collegiate victory at the Fighting Illini Invitational hosted by the University of Illinois on October 1, 2007, by shooting a 203 (70-63-70) to win the tournament by one stroke.[4] In the summer of 2005, Fowler won the Western Junior and competed in the U.S. Amateur, where he was defeated by the eventual champion Richie Ramsay.
In 2006, Fowler shot a 137 for two rounds at the U.S. Junior Amateur and was knocked out in the second round of match play. The championship was won by Philip Francis. Fowler represented the United States in its victory at the 2007 Walker Cup. His record was 2–0 in foursomes and 1–1 in singles making his overall record 3–1. Billy Horschel was his partner for both of their foursome victories. That year Fowler won the Sunnehanna Amateur in June and the Players Amateur in July. In 2008, Fowler repeated as Sunnehanna Amateur champion. In the first round of the U.S. Open, Fowler shot a −1 (70) and was in a tie for 7th place. He was one of three amateurs to make the cut, along with Derek Fathauer and Michael Thompson. He ended the tournament tied for 60th.
In October 2008, Fowler played on the Eisenhower Trophy team that finished second. He was the leading individual player.[citation needed] In 2009, Fowler made his second and last appearance in the Walker Cup. He won all four matches in which he played as the U.S. won by a seven-point margin. His partner in both foursomes matches was Bud Cauley. He also finished third in the Sunnehanna Amateur in 2009. Fowler was given the 2008 Ben Hogan Award.[5]
In 2009, Fowler had the first runner-up finish of his career on the Nationwide Tour in the Nationwide Children's Hospital Invitational losing in a playoff to Derek Lamely. After the Walker Cup, Fowler turned professional and played the Albertsons Boise Open on the Nationwide Tour for his pro debut.[6]
In September 2009, it was announced that Fowler signed a multi-year equipment deal with Titleist.[7] He has since signed a deal with Rolex. Fowler's first PGA Tour event as a professional was the Justin Timberlake Shriners Hospitals for Children Open where he finished tied for seventh.[8] His second PGA Tour event was at the Frys.com Open played at Grayhawk Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona. He finished tied for second after losing to Troy Matteson in a three-way playoff that included Jamie Lovemark. Fowler's score of 18-under-par included a hole-in-one on the fifth hole in his final round. Fowler also notched an eagle in each of his four rounds.[9] In November, he finished T2 with D. A. Points, two shots behind the winner Mark Brooks in the Pebble Beach Invitational an unofficial money event on the PGA Tour. In December 2009, Fowler successfully gained his PGA Tour card for 2010 through qualifying school, finishing T15.[10]
In February 2010, Fowler finished second at the Waste Management Phoenix Open with a score of 15-under-par at the TPC of Scottsdale course. In June, Fowler notched his third PGA Tour runner-up finish at the Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio. Fowler entered the final round in the lead, but shot a 73 to finish behind Justin Rose, who recorded his first PGA Tour victory. This performance took Fowler into the top 50 of the Official World Golf Ranking.
In September, he signed a clothing deal with Puma.[11] In the same month, he was also chosen as a captain's pick for the U.S. Ryder Cup team.[12] At age 21 years and 9 months when the matches began, Fowler became the youngest U.S. Ryder Cup player of all time, and only European Sergio García was younger when he made his Ryder Cup debut in 1999. Fowler forfeited a hole during foursomes competition on the first match day because of a rules violation, by taking a permissible free drop from muddy conditions in an improper location, a mistake U.S. captain Corey Pavin attributed to Fowler's inexperience.[13] On the final day of the competition in his singles match against Edoardo Molinari, Fowler birdied the last 4 holes to halve the match after having been 4 down after 12 holes.[14] Fowler won the Rookie of the Year award,[15] controversially claiming the award over Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy.[16][17]
In July 2011, Fowler tied the 54-hole lead at the AT&T National, but an early double bogey on Sunday derailed his opportunity for his first PGA Tour win. Two weeks later Fowler finished tied for 5th in The Open Championship at Royal St George's.[18] In August, Fowler finished in a tie for second at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational behind winner Adam Scott, lifting him to 28 in the world rankings.[19]
At the PGA Championship, Fowler carded 74-69-75-68 to finish with a six-over par total of 286, in a tie for 51st place. Early on the third day Fowler rocketed up the leaderboard with three birdies in the first five holes only to falter later in the round with two triple bogeys, effectively ending his hopes of a first major championship and PGA Tour win.[20]
At the first FedEx Cup playoff event, Fowler finished T52 at The Barclays in the last week in August. The following week he again finished T52 at the Deutsche Bank Championship, the second FedEx Cup playoff event, after carding a disappointing six-over par final round 77. At that point Fowler was positioned 37 in the FedEx Cup points standings and required a strong performance at the BMW Championship to qualify in the top thirty for The Tour Championship; a performance which eluded him, finishing in 48th place. In finishing 43rd in the FedEx Cup, Fowler earned a $132,000 bonus.[21]
In October, Fowler enjoyed his first professional win with victory in the OneAsia Tour's Kolon Korea Open, securing a six-shot victory over Rory McIlroy.
Fowler ended 2011 ranked 32nd in the world.[22]
In September, Fowler, along with Graeme McDowell, was part of the PGA Tour's These Guys are Good campaign.[23][24]
In May 2012, Fowler won the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte on the first extra hole of a sudden-death playoff. Replaying the 18th hole, he defeated Rory McIlroy and D. A. Points with a birdie to gain his first PGA Tour win. Fowler shot a 69 (−3) in the final round to finish in a three-way tie after 72 holes at Quail Hollow Club. This win enabled Fowler to break the top-25 in the world, placing him at number 24. The following week at The Players Championship in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, Fowler played the final hole at −11 under par and had a birdie opportunity to bring him within one of leader and eventual winner Matt Kuchar. Fowler, however, pushed his putt to the right and finished in a tie for second, the fifth second-place finish of his career.
In 2013 Fowler finished runner-up in the Australian PGA Championship, four shots behind the tournament winner Adam Scott.
After a tie for fifth at the Masters in April, Fowler had his best finish of 2014 at the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina. Fowler was runner-up with Erik Compton at −1, best finishes for both at a major, but they were eight strokes behind champion Martin Kaymer. Fowler had another second-place finish, at the Open Championship at Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake, England. He began the final round six strokes behind Rory McIlroy and finished the day tied for second with Sergio García at −15, two strokes behind McIlroy.
At the next major in August, the PGA Championship,  Fowler, Phil Mickelson, Henrik Stenson, and McIlroy battled for the title on a rain-soaked Valhalla Golf Club, near Louisville. Despite holding the lead for a good portion of the day, Fowler tied for third. He was only the third player, along with Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods, to have finished in the top 5 in all four majors in one calendar year, but the first not to win (Jordan Spieth became the fourth player in 2015). Fowler had 10 top-10 finishes during the 2013–14 season. His 8th-place finish at The Tour Championship moved him to 10th in the world golf rankings.[25]
After a T-12 finish at the Masters, Fowler earned his first win in over three years with a playoff victory at The Players Championship in May. Trailing Sergio García midway through the final round by five shots, Fowler played the final six holes in 6-under par, including an eagle at the par-5 16th. After a birdie at the 17th hole, Fowler's final birdie of the round on 18 left him at 12-under par. Both García and Kevin Kisner had birdie attempts to win at the 18th in regulation, but both missed and the three men went to a three-hole aggregate playoff to decide a winner on holes 16–18. Fowler and Kisner went par-birdie-par to tie at −1 while García's three pars left him at even and he was eliminated. Thus Fowler and Kisner went to sudden death starting at the 17th, where Kisner's tee shot landed within about 12 feet (3.7 m) of the cup. Fowler's tee shot finished inside of five feet, and when Kisner's birdie attempt slid by, Fowler responded by making his short birdie to claim the championship. Fowler played his final 10 holes in 8-under par.[26] On July 12, he won the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open on the European Tour, shooting a 12-under-par 268. On September 7, he won the Deutsche Bank Championship, the second FedEx Cup Playoffs event, by one stroke over Henrik Stenson, for his third victory on the PGA Tour.
After finishing fifth in the Hyundai Tournament of Champions in Hawaii, Fowler claimed his first victory of 2016 in the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship on the European Tour. He shot a final round of 69 to finish one clear of Belgium's Thomas Pieters.[27] Two weeks later, Fowler was in contention to win again but lost out to Japan's Hideki Matsuyama in a playoff at the Waste Management Phoenix Open.[28] On March 7, Fowler sparked fantastic scenes after sinking a hole-in-one with fellow tour pro Luke Donald's pitching wedge to win $1 million for Ernie Els' charity, Els for Autism.[29]
In June, Fowler announced that he would not defend his Scottish Open title at Castle Stuart, citing the tight schedule due to golf's return to the Olympic Games as the main reason.[30] At the 2016 Olympics, he came in 37th place.[31]
At the first FedEx Cup playoff event of the season, The Barclays, Fowler went into the final round leading the event by one stroke. He endured a difficult final round, shooting a two-over-par 74. His challenge was ended with a double-bogey at the 16th hole that put him four strokes behind playing partner Patrick Reed. He went on to finish T7, three strokes behind the winner Reed. As a result of this, Fowler also failed to secure his automatic Ryder Cup spot, which he would have done with a top-three finish. Fowler moved up from 28th to 16th in the FedEx Cup standings with this result.
On February 26, Fowler won The Honda Classic for his fourth PGA Tour win. For the first time in his career, Fowler preserved his 54-hole lead to win. The title saw Fowler move back up into the top 10 of the world rankings.
On June 16, Fowler carded a round of 65 at Erin Hills to take the first round lead at the 2017 U.S. Open. Fowler equaled the lowest first round score at the U.S. Open and led by one stroke from Paul Casey and Xander Schauffele. He followed this up with a one over par 73 in the second round to fall out of the lead by one stroke, held by four other players. He shot 68–72 over the weekend to finish in a tie for fifth place. Fowler started the PGA Championship with a 2-under 69 which was two strokes behind the leaders. After rounds of 70–73, he closed out the year's last major with a 4-under 67, including a run of four consecutive birdies on holes 12 through 15. Despite his solid finish, Fowler ended up tied for fifth and was 3 strokes behind the winner, and friend, Justin Thomas. It was his seventh top-5 major finish, meaning he has had multiple top-5 finishes at every major.
On November 12, 2017, Fowler started his 2018 season at the OHL Classic at Mayakoba where he shot rounds of 65-67-67-67 for an 18-under-par total, one stroke shy of winner, Patton Kizzire. It was his 12th tour runner-up finish and he became just the 27th golfer in PGA Tour history to win $30,000,000 in Tour earnings.[32]
On December 3, 2017, Fowler recorded a 61, 11-under-par, in the fourth round to win the Hero World Challenge. He came from 7 strokes behind the 54-hole leader, Charley Hoffman and claimed a four-stroke victory. The round of 61 was a course and tournament record, as well as being a personal best round for Fowler as a professional.[33]
At the 2018 Waste Management Phoenix Open, Fowler birdied his final three holes during the third round to take the 54-hole lead by a stroke. This was his 6th 54-hole lead/co-lead of his career but had only converted once in the previous five attempts. In the final round, Fowler shot a 72 (+2) to finish T11.[34]
At the 2018 Masters Tournament, Fowler shot a 72-hole score of −14 (274) to finish in 2nd place to champion Patrick Reed by 1 stroke. It was his eighth top-5 major finish, giving him multiple top-5 finishes at every major, however, he still has yet to win one.
In September 2018, Fowler qualified for the U.S. team participating in the 2018 Ryder Cup. Europe defeated the U.S. team 17 1/2 to 10 1/2. He went 1-3-0. He lost his singles match against Sergio García.[35]
In January, Fowler signed a multi-year deal to use TaylorMade golf balls and gloves.[36] On February 3, Fowler won the Waste Management Phoenix Open after having a four-stroke lead in the final round, losing the lead, then regaining the lead for a two-stroke victory.
In December 2019, Fowler played on the U.S. team at the 2019 Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne Golf Club in Australia. The U.S. team won 16–14. Fowler went 1–0–3 and halved his Sunday singles match against Marc Leishman.[37]
At the Sentry Tournament of Champions, Fowler finished T5th. The following week at The American Express, Fowler finished T10th. This would be Fowler's last top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour for a while as he started to struggle.
The 2019–20 PGA Tour season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Once the season resumed, Fowler's struggles continued with up and down results. Fowler's best results after the restart included T12th at the Rocket Mortgage Classic and a T15th at the 2020 WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational. However, Fowler struggled at times to make the cut at many tournaments and missed 6 cuts out of 14 tournaments Fowler played in the period of January to August.[citation needed] Fowler missed the cut at the 2020 PGA Championship. For the FedEx Cup playoffs, Fowler finished T49th at The Northern Trust and failed to qualify for the BMW Championship. After a month of rest, Fowler returned to compete in the 2020 U.S. Open. Fowler finished T49th. At the 2020 Masters Tournament, Fowler would finish T29th.
As Fowler continued to struggle with a missed cut at the 2021 Players Championship and a T65th at the Honda Classic, he was at risk of missing the 2021 Masters Tournament heading into the Valero Texas Open. Fowler finished T17th, and therefore missed the Masters. This was the first major Fowler missed since not qualifying for the 2010 U.S. Open.
Fowler missed cuts at the Wells Fargo Championship and the AT&T Byron Nelson. At the 2021 PGA Championship, he finished T8th, his first top-10 finish in an event since the 2020 Sentry Tournament of Champions.
Fowler's struggles continued into 2022, missing his first three cuts until a T55th finish at the Genesis Invitational. He only played one major, the PGA Championship, where he tied for 23rd. Fowler barely retained his Tour card, finishing 125th in the FedEx Cup, claiming the last spot.
In the off-season, Fowler parted ways with long-time caddie Joe Skovron, who spent 13 years with Fowler, replacing him with Ricky Romano. Fowler also fired swing coach John Tillery, bringing back his old swing coach, Butch Harmon.[citation needed] These changes produced improved results, as Fowler finished tied for 6th in the season opening Fortinet Championship. After a missed cut at the Shriners Children's Open, Fowler tied for second at the Zozo Championship, one shot behind winner Keegan Bradley. This was Fowler's best finish on Tour since the 2019 Honda Classic, where he also tied for second.
In July, Fowler won the Rocket Mortgage Classic in a playoff over Collin Morikawa and Adam Hadwin. It was his first win on the PGA Tour since the 2019 Waste Management Phoenix Open.[38]
Fowler resides in Jupiter, Florida, relocating from Las Vegas following the 2010 season.[39] Fowler's middle name, Yutaka, comes from his maternal grandfather, who is Japanese.[40]  His maternal grandmother is Navajo Native American.[41] On the final day of a golf tournament Fowler wears orange[42] in honor of Oklahoma State University.[43]
Fowler is one of four golfers in the ""Golf Boys"" group along with fellow PGA Tour players Ben Crane, Bubba Watson and Hunter Mahan. The Golf Boys released a YouTube video of the song ""Oh Oh Oh"" on the eve of the 2011 U.S. Open. Farmers Insurance donated $1,000 for every 100,000 views of the video. The charitable proceeds went to support both Farmers and Ben Crane charitable initiatives.[44]
In 2012, Fowler filmed a commercial for Crowne Plaza Hotels entitled ""It's Good to be Rickie"" with golf commentator Ian Baker Finch. He was featured in an ESPN ""This is SportsCenter"" commercial with sportscaster John Anderson in 2013.[45] On November 28, 2015, Fowler was the guest picker on ESPN's College GameDay (his picks went 7–4).[importance?] In 2015, Fowler was announced as an official ambassador for PGA Junior League Golf, a program owned and operated by the PGA of America.[46]
Fowler started dating track and field amateur athlete Allison Stokke in 2017.[47] They became engaged in June 2018,[48] and married in October 2019.[49] The couple has two daughters.[50]

Los Angeles[b] (LA) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of California, and the commercial, financial, and cultural center of Southern California. With an estimated 3.88 million residents within the city limits as of 2024[update],[8] it is the second-most populous city in the United States, behind New York City. Los Angeles has an ethnically and culturally diverse population, and is the principal city of a metropolitan area of 12.9 million people (2024). Greater Los Angeles, a combined statistical area that includes the Los Angeles and Riverside–San Bernardino metropolitan areas, is a sprawling metropolis of over 18.5 million residents.
The majority of the city proper lies in the Los Angeles Basin adjacent to the Pacific Ocean in the west and extending partly through the Santa Monica Mountains and north into the San Fernando Valley, with the city bordering the San Gabriel Valley to its east. It covers about 469 square miles (1,210 km2),[6] and is the county seat and most populated city of Los Angeles County, which is the most populous county in the United States with an estimated 9.86 million residents as of 2022[update].[17] It is the third-most visited city in the U.S. with over 2.7 million visitors as of 2023.[18]
The area that became Los Angeles was originally inhabited by the indigenous Tongva people and later claimed by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542. The city was founded on September 4, 1781, under Spanish governor Felipe de Neve, on the village of Yaanga.[19] It became a part of the First Mexican Empire in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican–American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and became part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city.[20] The city was further expanded with the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which delivers water from Eastern California.
Los Angeles has a diverse economy with a broad range of industries. Despite a steep exodus of film and television production since the COVID-19 pandemic,[21] Los Angeles is still one of the largest hubs of American film production,[22][23] the world's largest by revenue; the city is an important site in the history of film. It also has one of the busiest container ports in the Americas,[24][25][26] and despite a business exodus from downtown Los Angeles, the city's urban core is evolving as a cultural center with the world's largest showcase of architecture designed by Frank Gehry.[27] In 2018, the Los Angeles metropolitan area had a gross metropolitan product of over $1.0 trillion,[28] making it the city with the third-largest GDP in the world, after New York and Tokyo. Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics in 1932 and 1984, and will also host in 2028.
On September 4, 1781, a group of 44 settlers known as ""Los Pobladores"" founded the pueblo (town) they called El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles, 'The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels'.[29] The original name of the settlement is disputed; the Guinness Book of World Records rendered it as ""El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles del Río Porciúncula"";[30] other sources have shortened or alternate versions of the longer name.[31]
The local English pronunciation of the name of the city has varied over time. A 1953 article in the journal of the American Name Society asserts that the pronunciation /lɔːs ˈændʒələs/ lawss AN-jəl-əs was established following the 1850 incorporation of the city and that since the 1880s the pronunciation /loʊs ˈæŋɡələs/ lohss ANG-gəl-əs emerged from a trend in California to give places Spanish, or Spanish-sounding, names and pronunciations.[32] In 1908, librarian Charles Fletcher Lummis, who argued for the name's pronunciation with a hard g (/ɡ/),[33][34] reported that there were at least 12 pronunciation variants.[35] In the early 1900s, the Los Angeles Times advocated for pronouncing it Loce AHNG-hayl-ais (/loʊs ˈɑːŋheɪleɪs/), approximating Spanish [los ˈaŋxeles], by printing the respelling under its masthead for several years.[36] This did not find favor.[37]
Since the 1930s, /lɔːs ˈændʒələs/ has been most common.[38] In 1934, the United States Board on Geographic Names decreed that this pronunciation be used by the federal government.[36] This was also endorsed in 1952 by a ""jury"" appointed by Mayor Fletcher Bowron to devise an official pronunciation.[32][36]
Common pronunciations in the United Kingdom include /lɒs ˈændʒɪliːz, -lɪz, -lɪs/ loss AN-jil-eez, -⁠iz, -⁠iss.[39] Phonetician Jack Windsor Lewis described the most common one, /lɒs ˈændʒɪliːz/ ⓘ, as a spelling pronunciation based on analogy to Greek words ending in -‍es, ""reflecting a time when the classics were familiar if Spanish was not"".[40]
The settlement of Indigenous Californians in the modern Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley was dominated by the Tongva (now also known as the Gabrieleño since the era of Spanish colonization). The historic center of Tongva power in the region was the settlement of Yaanga (Tongva: Iyáangẚ), meaning ""place of the poison oak"", which would one day be the site where the Spanish founded the Pueblo de Los Ángeles. Iyáangẚ has also been translated as ""the valley of smoke"".[41][42][43][44][19]
Maritime explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed the area of southern California for the Spanish Empire in 1542, while on an official military exploring expedition, as he was moving northward along the Pacific coast from earlier colonizing bases of New Spain in Central and South America.[45] Gaspar de Portolà and Franciscan missionary Juan Crespí reached the present site of Los Angeles on August 2, 1769.[46]
In 1771, Franciscan friar Junípero Serra directed the building of the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, the first mission in the area.[47] On September 4, 1781, a group of 44 settlers known as ""Los Pobladores"" founded the pueblo (town) they called El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles, 'The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels'.[29] The present-day city has the largest Roman Catholic archdiocese in the United States. Two-thirds of the Mexican or (New Spain) settlers were mestizo or mulatto, a mixture of African, indigenous, and European ancestry.[48] The settlement remained a small ranch town for decades, but by 1820, the population had increased to about 650 residents.[49] Today, the pueblo is commemorated in the historic district of Los Angeles Pueblo Plaza and Olvera Street, the oldest part of Los Angeles.[50]
New Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and the pueblo now existed within the new Mexican Republic. During Mexican rule, Governor Pío Pico made Los Angeles the regional capital of Alta California.[51] By this time, the new republic introduced more secularization acts within the Los Angeles region.[52] In 1846, during the wider Mexican–American War, marines from the United States occupied the pueblo. This resulted in the siege of Los Angeles, where 150 Mexican militias fought the occupiers, who eventually surrendered.[53]
Mexican rule ended following the American Conquest of California, part of the larger Mexican-American War. Americans took control from the Californios after a series of battles, culminating with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on January 13, 1847.[54] The Mexican Cession was formalized in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, which ceded Los Angeles and the rest of Alta California to the United States.
Railroads arrived with the completion of the transcontinental Southern Pacific line from New Orleans to Los Angeles in 1876 and the Santa Fe Railroad in 1885.[55] Petroleum was discovered in the city and surrounding area in 1892, and by 1923, the discoveries had helped California become the country's largest oil producer, accounting for about one-quarter of the world's petroleum output.[56]
By 1900, the population had grown to more than 102,000,[57] putting pressure on the city's water supply.[58] The completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, under the supervision of William Mulholland, ensured the continued growth of the city.[59] Because of clauses in the city's charter that prevented the City of Los Angeles from selling or providing water from the aqueduct to any area outside its borders, many adjacent cities and communities felt compelled to join Los Angeles.[60][61][62]
Los Angeles created the first municipal zoning ordinance in the United States. On September 14, 1908, the Los Angeles City Council promulgated residential and industrial land use zones. The new ordinance established three residential zones of a single type, where industrial uses were prohibited. The proscriptions included barns, lumber yards, and any industrial land use employing machine-powered equipment. These laws were enforced against industrial properties after the fact. These prohibitions were in addition to existing activities that were already regulated as nuisances. These included explosives warehousing, gas works, oil drilling, slaughterhouses, and tanneries. The Los Angeles City Council also designated seven industrial zones within the city. However, between 1908 and 1915, the Los Angeles City Council created various exceptions to the broad proscriptions that applied to these three residential zones, and as a consequence, some industrial uses emerged within them. There are two differences between the 1908 Residence District Ordinance and later zoning laws in the United States. First, the 1908 laws did not establish a comprehensive zoning map as the 1916 New York City Zoning Ordinance did. Second, the residential zones did not distinguish types of housing; they treated apartments, hotels, and detached single-family housing equally.[63]
In 1910, Hollywood merged into Los Angeles, with 10 movie companies already operating in the city at the time. By 1921, more than 80 percent of the world's film industry was concentrated in L.A.[64] The money generated by the industry kept the city insulated from much of the economic loss suffered by the rest of the country during the Great Depression.[65]
By 1930, the population surpassed one million.[66] In 1932, the city hosted the Summer Olympics.
During World War II, Los Angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing, such as shipbuilding and aircraft. Calship built hundreds of Liberty Ships and Victory Ships on Terminal Island, and the Los Angeles area was the headquarters of six of the country's major aircraft manufacturers (Douglas Aircraft Company, Hughes Aircraft, Lockheed, North American Aviation, Northrop Corporation, and Vultee). During the war, more aircraft were produced in one year than in all the pre-war years since the Wright brothers flew the first airplane in 1903, combined. Manufacturing in Los Angeles skyrocketed, and as William S. Knudsen, of the National Defense Advisory Commission, put it, ""We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible.""[67]
After the end of World War II Los Angeles grew more rapidly than ever, sprawling into the San Fernando Valley.[68] The expansion of the state owned Interstate Highway System during the 1950s and 1960s helped propel suburban growth and signaled the demise of the city's privately owned electrified rail system, once the world's largest.

As a consequence of World War II, suburban growth, and population density, many amusement parks were built and operated in this area.[69] An example is Beverly Park, which was located at the corner of Beverly Boulevard and La Cienega before being closed and substituted by the Beverly Center.[70]
In the second half of the 20th century, Los Angeles substantially reduced the amount of housing that could be built by drastically downzoning the city. In 1960, the city had a total zoned capacity for approximately 10 million people. By 1990, that capacity had fallen to 4.5 million as a result of policy decisions to ban housing through zoning.[71]
Racial tensions led to the Watts riots in 1965, resulting in 34 deaths and over 1,000 injuries.[72]
In 1969, California became the birthplace of the Internet, as the first ARPANET transmission was sent from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park.[73]
In 1973, Tom Bradley was elected as the city's first African American mayor, serving for five terms until retiring in 1993. Other events in the city during the 1970s included the Symbionese Liberation Army's South Central standoff in 1974 and the Hillside Stranglers murder cases in 1977–1978.[74]
In early 1984, the city surpassed Chicago in population, thus becoming the second-largest city in the United States.[75]
In 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time. Despite being boycotted by 14 Communist countries, the 1984 Olympics became more financially successful than any previous,[76] and the second Olympics to turn a profit; the other, according to an analysis of contemporary newspaper reports, was the 1932 Summer Olympics, also held in Los Angeles.[77]
Racial tensions erupted on April 29, 1992, with the acquittal by a Simi Valley jury of four Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers captured on videotape beating Rodney King, culminating in large-scale riots.[78][79]
In 1994, the magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake shook the city, causing $12.5 billion in damage and 72 deaths.[80] The century ended with the Rampart scandal, one of the most extensive documented cases of police misconduct in American history.[81]
In 2002, Mayor James Hahn led the campaign against secession, resulting in voters defeating efforts by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood to secede from the city.[82]
In 2022, Karen Bass became the city's first female mayor, making Los Angeles the largest U.S. city to have ever had a woman as mayor.[83]
In January 2025, a series of devastating wildfires caused by severe winds swept through Southern California, with the Pacific Palisades fire causing widespread destruction in Los Angeles's northwestern community of Pacific Palisades, with many calling it the most destructive in the history of the city of Los Angeles.[84]
In June 2025, the city experienced protests and riots following raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).[85] Los Angeles is being targeted by the Trump administration over its sanctuary city status sending in hundred of federal agents to target the immigrant community of the city.[86] Trump sent in the Army National Guard and US Marines without the consent of local governments.[87]
Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games, making Los Angeles the third city to host the Olympics three times.[88][89]
The city of Los Angeles covers a total area of 502.7 square miles (1,302 km2), comprising 468.7 square miles (1,214 km2) of land and 34.0 square miles (88 km2) of water.[90] The city extends for 44 miles (71 km) from north to south and for 29 miles (47 km) from east to west. The perimeter of the city is 342 miles (550 km).
Los Angeles is both flat and hilly. The highest point in the city proper is Mount Lukens at 5,074 ft (1,547 m),[91][92] located in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains at the north extent of the Crescenta Valley. The eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains stretches from Downtown to the Pacific Ocean and separates the Los Angeles Basin from the San Fernando Valley. Other hilly parts of Los Angeles include the Mt. Washington area north of Downtown, eastern parts such as Boyle Heights, the Crenshaw district around the Baldwin Hills, and the San Pedro district.
Surrounding the city are much higher mountains. Immediately to the north lie the San Gabriel Mountains, which is a popular recreation area for Angelenos. Its high point is Mount San Antonio, locally known as Mount Baldy, which reaches 10,064 feet (3,068 m). Further afield, the highest point in southern California is San Gorgonio Mountain, 81 miles (130 km) east of downtown Los Angeles,[93] with a height of 11,503 feet (3,506 m).
The Los Angeles River, which is largely seasonal, is the primary drainage channel. It was straightened and lined in 51 miles (82 km) of concrete by the Army Corps of Engineers to act as a flood control channel.[94] The river begins in the Canoga Park district of the city, flows east from the San Fernando Valley along the north edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, and turns south through the city center, flowing to its mouth in the Port of Long Beach at the Pacific Ocean. The smaller Ballona Creek flows into the Santa Monica Bay at Playa del Rey.
Los Angeles is rich in native plant species partly because of its diversity of habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains. The most prevalent plant communities are coastal sage scrub, chaparral shrubland, and riparian woodland.[95] Native plants include: the California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Ceanothus, Chamise, Coast Live Oak, sycamore, willow and Giant Wildrye. Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered. Mexican Fan Palms, Canary Island Palms, Queen Palms, Date Palms, and California Fan Palms are common in the Los Angeles area, although only the last is native to California, though still not native to the City of Los Angeles.
Los Angeles has several official flora:
The city has an urban population of bobcats (Lynx rufus).[99] Mange is a common problem in this population.[99] Although Serieys et al. 2014 find selection of immune genetics at several loci they do not demonstrate that this produces a real difference which helps the bobcats to survive future mange outbreaks.[99]
Bats, coyotes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, snakes, and squirrels are wild animals commonly found in the Los Angeles area.[100][101] Mountain lions, mule deer, and other wild animals are also commonly spotted in Southern California.[102]
Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. The geologic instability has produced numerous faults, which cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes annually in Southern California, though most of them are too small to be felt.[103] The strike-slip San Andreas Fault system, which sits at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, passes through the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The segment of the fault passing through Southern California experiences a major earthquake roughly every 110 to 140 years, and seismologists have warned about the next ""big one"", as the last major earthquake was the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake.[104] The Los Angeles basin and metropolitan area are also at risk from blind thrust earthquakes.[105] Major earthquakes that have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1933 Long Beach, 1971 San Fernando, 1987 Whittier Narrows, and the 1994 Northridge events. All but a few are of low intensity and are not felt. The USGS has released the UCERF California earthquake forecast, which models earthquake occurrence in California. Parts of the city are also vulnerable to tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from Aleutian Islands earthquake in 1946, Valdivia earthquake in 1960, Alaska earthquake in 1964, Chile earthquake in 2010 and Japan earthquake in 2011.[106]
The city is divided into many different districts and neighborhoods,[107][108] some of which had been separately incorporated cities that eventually merged with Los Angeles.[109] These neighborhoods were developed piecemeal, and are well-defined enough that the city has signage which marks nearly all of them.[110]
The city's street patterns generally follow a grid plan, with uniform block lengths and occasional roads that cut across blocks. However, this is complicated by rugged terrain, which has necessitated having different grids for each of the valleys that Los Angeles covers. Major streets are designed to move large volumes of traffic through many parts of the city, many of which are extremely long; Sepulveda Boulevard is 43 miles (69 km) long, while Foothill Boulevard is over 60 miles (97 km) long, reaching as far east as San Bernardino. Drivers in Los Angeles suffer from one of the worst rush hour periods in the world, according to an annual traffic index by navigation system maker, TomTom. LA drivers spend an additional 92 hours in traffic each year. During the peak rush hour, there is 80% congestion, according to the index.[111]
Los Angeles is often characterized by the presence of low-rise buildings, in contrast to New York City. Outside of a few centers such as downtown, Warner Center, Century City, Koreatown, Miracle Mile, Hollywood, and Westwood, skyscrapers and high-rise buildings are not common in Los Angeles. However, downtown Los Angeles has many buildings over 30 stories, with fourteen over 50 stories, and two over 70 stories, the tallest of which is the Wilshire Grand Center.
Los Angeles has a two-season semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh) with dry summers and very mild winters, but it receives more annual precipitation than most semi-arid climates, narrowly missing the boundary of a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csb on the coast, Csa otherwise).[113] Daytime temperatures are generally temperate all year round. In winter, they average around 68 °F (20 °C).[114] Autumn months tend to be hot, with major heat waves a common occurrence in September and October, while the spring months tend to be cooler and experience more precipitation. Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.[115]
Temperatures in the coastal basin exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on a dozen or so days in the year, from one day a month in April, May, June and November to three days a month in July, August, October and to five days in September.[115] Temperatures in the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys are considerably warmer. Temperatures are subject to substantial daily swings; in inland areas, the difference between the average daily low and the average daily high is over 30 °F (17 °C).[116] The average annual temperature of the sea is 63 °F (17 °C), from 58 °F (14 °C) in January to 68 °F (20 °C) in August.[117] Hours of sunshine total more than 3,000 per year, from an average of 7 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of 12 in July.[118]
Due to the mountainous terrain of the surrounding region, the Los Angeles area contains a large number of distinct microclimates, causing extreme variations in temperature in close physical proximity to each other. For example, the average July maximum temperature at the Santa Monica Pier is 70 °F (21 °C) whereas it is 95 °F (35 °C) in Canoga Park, 15 miles (24 km) away.[119] The city, like much of the Southern Californian coast, is subject to a late spring/early summer weather phenomenon called ""June Gloom"". This involves overcast or foggy skies in the morning that yield to sun by early afternoon.[120]
More recently, statewide droughts in California have further strained the city's water security.[121] Downtown Los Angeles averages 14.67 in (373 mm) of precipitation annually, mainly occurring between November and March,[122][116] generally in the form of moderate rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall during winter storms. Rainfall is usually higher in the hills and coastal slopes of the mountains because of orographic uplift. Summer days are usually rainless. Rarely, an incursion of moist air from the south or east can bring brief thunderstorms in late summer, especially to the mountains. The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the inland and mountain areas get considerably more. Years of average rainfall are rare. The usual pattern is a year-to-year variability, with a short string of dry years of 5–10 in (130–250 mm) rainfall, followed by one or two wet years with more than 20 in (510 mm).[116] Wet years are usually associated with warm water El Niño conditions in the Pacific, dry years with cooler water La Niña episodes. A series of rainy days can bring floods to the lowlands and mudslides to the hills, especially after wildfires have denuded the slopes.
Both freezing temperatures and snowfall are extremely rare in the city basin and along the coast, with the last occurrence of a 32 °F (0 °C) reading at the downtown station being January 29, 1979;[116] freezing temperatures occur nearly every year in valley locations, while the mountains within city limits typically receive snowfall every winter. The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2.0 inches (5 cm) on January 15, 1932.[116][123] While the most recent snowfall occurred in February 2019, the first snowfall since 1962,[124][125] with snow falling in areas adjacent to Los Angeles as recently as January 2021.[126] Brief, localized instances of hail can occur on rare occasions, but are more common than snowfall. At the official downtown station, the highest recorded temperature is 113 °F (45 °C) on September 27, 2010,[116][127] while the lowest is 28 °F (−2 °C),[116] on January 4, 1949.[116] Within the City of Los Angeles, the highest temperature ever officially recorded is 121 °F (49 °C), on September 6, 2020, at the weather station at Pierce College in the San Fernando Valley neighborhood of Woodland Hills.[128] During autumn and winter, Santa Ana winds sometimes bring much warmer and drier conditions to Los Angeles, and raise wildfire risk.
Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog. The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhaust from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources.[137]
The smog season lasts from approximately May to October.[138] While other large cities rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches (380 mm) of rain each year: pollution accumulates over many consecutive days. Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act. When the act was passed, California was unable to create a State Implementation Plan that would enable it to meet the new air quality standards, largely because of the level of pollution in Los Angeles generated by older vehicles.[139] More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low-emission vehicles. Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years because of aggressive steps to reduce it, which include electric and hybrid cars, improvements in mass transit, and other measures.
The number of Stage 1 smog alerts in Los Angeles has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium.[140] Despite improvement, the 2006 and 2007 annual reports of the American Lung Association ranked the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution.[141] In 2008, the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year-round particulate pollution.[142] The city met its goal of providing 20 percent of the city's power from renewable sources in 2010.[143] The American Lung Association's 2013 survey ranks the metro area as having the nation's worst smog, and fourth in both short-term and year-round pollution amounts.[144]
Los Angeles is also home to the nation's largest urban oil field. There are more than 700 active oil wells within 1,500 feet (460 m) of homes, churches, schools, and hospitals in the city, a situation about which the EPA has voiced serious concerns.[145]
The 2020 U.S. census reported Los Angeles had a population of 3,898,747.[163] The population density was 8,304.2 people per square mile (3,168 people per square kilometer). 5.2% of the total population is under 5 years old, 19.5% under 18 and 13.8% 65 years old and over.[163] Females make up 50.2% of the total population.[163]
Owner-occupied housing units make up 36.3% of the total Los Angeles housing units, and they cost $879,500 on average. (2019–2023)[163] With a mortgage, the median selected monthly owner costs are $3,399, and without a mortgage $950. (2019–2023)[163] Median gross rent is $1,879. (2019–2023)[163] There are 1,419,663 households in Los Angeles, with an average of 2.64 people being part of them. (2019–2023).[163]
66.5% of the total population aged 16 and over make up Los Angeles in civilian labor force, while among female residents aged 16 and over the percentage is 61.0%.[163] In 2022, accommodation and food services made $17,366,966, health care and social assistance sectors made $46,297,839, transportation and warehousing $25,410,257, and the retail sector $81,351,523, with residents spending an average of $21,281 in retail purchases throughout the year.[163] From 2019 to 2023, the median household income in Los Angeles was $80,366 (2023 dollars), while the per capita income in the past 12 months was $46,270.[163] 16.5% of Los Angeles inhabitants live in poverty.[163]
According to data in 2023 from the United States Census Bureau Los Angeles's population is 47.2% Hispanic or Latino, 28.3% non-Hispanic White, 8.5% Black, 12.0% Asian, 1.2% Native American and 0.1% Pacific Islander.[164] Ethnic enclaves like Chinatown, Historic Filipinotown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, Little Ethiopia, Tehrangeles, Little Tokyo, Little Bangladesh, and Thai Town provide examples of the polyglot character of Los Angeles.
Mexican ancestry makes up the largest origin among descendants of American countries other than the United States at 31.9% of the city's population, followed by those of Salvadoran (6.0%) and Guatemalan (3.6%) heritage. Descendants of Mexicans and Central Americans have long-established communities in Los Angeles and are spread throughout the entire city and its metropolitan area. It is most heavily concentrated in regions around Downtown, such as East Los Angeles, Northeast Los Angeles and Westlake.[165]
The largest Asian ethnic groups are Filipinos (3.2%) and Koreans (2.9%), which have their own established ethnic enclaves—Koreatown in the Wilshire Center and Historic Filipinotown.[166] Chinese people, which make up 1.8% of Los Angeles's population, reside mostly outside of Los Angeles city limits, in the San Gabriel Valley of eastern Los Angeles County, but make a sizable presence in the city, notably in Chinatown.[167] Chinatown and Thaitown are also home to many Thais and Cambodians, which make up 0.3% and 0.1% of Los Angeles's population, respectively. The Japanese comprise 0.9% of the city's population and have an established Little Tokyo in the city's downtown, and another significant community of Japanese Americans is in the Sawtelle district of West Los Angeles. Indians make up 0.9% of the city's population. Vietnamese make up 0.5% of Los Angeles's population.
Los Angeles is also home to Caucasian and Middle Eastern communities, such as Armenians, Assyrians, and Iranians, many of whom live in enclaves like Little Armenia and Tehrangeles.[168][169]
African Americans have been the predominant ethnic group in South Los Angeles, which has emerged as the largest African-American community in the western United States since the 1960s. The neighborhoods of South Los Angeles with highest concentration of African Americans include Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills, Leimert Park, Hyde Park, Gramercy Park, Manchester Square and Watts.[170] Since the 1990s, the growing cost of living in the city has most impacted the African American population. African Americans are the fastest declining population in the city, and many of the formerly predominantly African American neighborhoods have become much more diverse.[171][172] There is also a sizable Eritrean and Ethiopian community in the Fairfax region.[173]
Los Angeles has the second-largest Mexican, Armenian, Salvadoran, Filipino, and Guatemalan populations by city in the world, the third-largest Canadian population in the world, and has the largest Japanese, Iranian/Persian, Cambodian, and Romani (Gypsy) populations in the country.[174] The Italian community is concentrated in San Pedro.[175]
Most of Los Angeles's foreign-born population were born in Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, the Philippines and South Korea.[176]
According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Christianity is the most prevalently practiced religion in Los Angeles (65%).[177][178] The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles is the largest archdiocese in the country.[179] Cardinal Roger Mahony, as the archbishop, oversaw construction of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which opened in September 2002 in downtown Los Angeles.[180]
In 2011, the once common, but ultimately lapsed, custom of conducting a procession and Mass in honor of Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles, in commemoration of the founding of the City of Los Angeles in 1781, was revived by the Queen of Angels Foundation and its founder Mark Albert, with the support of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles as well as several civic leaders.[181] The recently revived custom is a continuation of the original processions and Masses that commenced on the first anniversary of the founding of Los Angeles in 1782 and continued for nearly a century thereafter.
With 621,000 Jews in the metropolitan area, the region has the second-largest population of Jews in the United States, after New York City.[182] Many of Los Angeles's Jews now live on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley, though Boyle Heights once had a large Jewish population before World War II due to restrictive housing covenants. Major Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods include Hancock Park, Pico-Robertson, and Valley Village, while Jewish Israelis are well represented in the Encino and Tarzana neighborhoods, and Persian Jews in Beverly Hills. Many varieties of Judaism are represented in the greater Los Angeles area, including Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, and Reconstructionist. The Breed Street Shul in East Los Angeles, built in 1923, was the largest synagogue west of Chicago in its early decades; it is no longer in daily use as a synagogue and is being converted to a museum and community center.[183][184] The Kabbalah Centre also has a presence in the city.[185]
The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel was founded in Los Angeles by Aimee Semple McPherson in 1923 and remains headquartered there to this day. For many years, the church convened at Angelus Temple, which, at its construction, was one of the largest churches in the country.[186]
Los Angeles has had a rich and influential Protestant tradition. The first Protestant service in Los Angeles was a Methodist meeting held in a private home in 1850, and the oldest Protestant church still operating, First Congregational Church, was founded in 1867.[187] In the early 1900s the Bible Institute Of Los Angeles published the founding documents of the Christian Fundamentalist movement and the Azusa Street Revival launched Pentecostalism.[187] The Metropolitan Community Church also had its origins in the Los Angeles area.[188] Important churches in the city include First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, Bel Air Presbyterian Church, First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles, West Angeles Church of God in Christ, Second Baptist Church, Crenshaw Christian Center, McCarty Memorial Christian Church, and First Congregational Church.
The Hollywood region of Los Angeles also has several significant headquarters, churches, including the Celebrity Center of the Church of Scientology.[189]
Because of Los Angeles's large multi-ethnic population, a wide variety of faiths are practiced, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, Baháʼí, various Eastern Orthodox Churches, Sufism, Shintoism, Taoism, Confucianism, Chinese folk religion and countless others. Immigrants from Asia, for example, have formed several significant Buddhist congregations, making the city home to the greatest variety of Buddhists in the world. The first Buddhist joss house was founded in the city in 1875.[187] Atheism and other secular beliefs are also common, as the city is the largest in the Western U.S. Unchurched Belt.
As of January 2020, there are 41,290 homeless people in the City of Los Angeles, comprising roughly 62% of the homeless population of LA County.[190] This is an increase of 14.2% over the previous year (with a 12.7% increase in the overall homeless population of LA County).[191][192] The epicenter of homelessness in Los Angeles is the Skid Row neighborhood, which contains 8,000 homeless people, one of the largest stable populations of homeless people in the United States.[193][194] The increased homeless population in Los Angeles has been attributed to lack of housing affordability[192] and to substance abuse.[195] Almost 60 percent of the 82,955 people who became newly homeless in 2019 said their homelessness was because of economic hardship.[191] In Los Angeles, black people are roughly four times more likely to experience homelessness.[191][196]
The economy of Los Angeles is driven by international trade, entertainment (television, motion pictures, video games, music recording, and production), aerospace, technology, petroleum, fashion, apparel, and tourism.[197] Other significant industries include finance, telecommunications, law, healthcare, and transportation. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Los Angeles was ranked the 19th most competitive financial center in the world and sixth most competitive in the U.S. after New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, D.C.[198] Although many businesses have left downtown Los Angeles following the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts are underway to re-invent the neighborhood as a cultural center with a large architectural showcase in Bunker Hill designed by Frank Gehry.[27]
Of the five major film studios, only Paramount Pictures is within Los Angeles's city limits;[199] it is located in the so-called Thirty-Mile Zone of entertainment headquarters in Southern California. Their parent company Paramount Skydance Corporation has had its corporate headquarters in Los Angeles since 2025.[200]

Los Angeles is the second-largest city in the United States but hosted no NFL team between 1995 and 2015. At one time, the Los Angeles area hosted two NFL teams: the Rams and the Raiders. Both left the city in 1995, with the Rams moving to St. Louis, and the Raiders moving back to their original home of Oakland. After 21 seasons in St. Louis, on January 12, 2016, the NFL announced the Rams would be moving back to Los Angeles for the 2016 NFL season with its home games played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for four seasons.[266][267][268] Before 1995, the Rams played their home games in the Coliseum from 1946 to 1979 which made them the first professional sports team to play in Los Angeles, and then moved to Anaheim Stadium from 1980 until 1994.

The current charter was adopted on June 8, 1999, and has been amended many times.[282] The elected government consists of the Los Angeles City Council and the mayor of Los Angeles, which operate under a mayor–council government, as well as the city attorney (not to be confused with the district attorney, a county office) and controller. The mayor is Karen Bass.[283] There are 15 city council districts.
The city has many departments and appointed officers, including the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD),[284] the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners,[285] the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD),[286] the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA),[287] the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT),[288] and the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL).[289]
The charter of the City of Los Angeles, ratified by voters in 1999, created a system of advisory neighborhood councils that would represent the diversity of stakeholders, defined as those who live, work, or own property in the neighborhood. The neighborhood councils are relatively autonomous and spontaneous in that they identify their own boundaries, establish their own bylaws, and elect their own officers. There are about 90 neighborhood councils.
Residents of Los Angeles elect supervisors for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th supervisorial districts.
In the California State Assembly, Los Angeles is split between fourteen districts.[290] In the California State Senate, the city is split between eight districts.[291] In the United States House of Representatives, it is split among nine congressional districts.[292]
Los Angeles City Presidential Election Results
In 1992, the city of Los Angeles recorded 1,092 murders.[295] Los Angeles experienced a significant decline in crime in the 1990s and late 2000s and reached a 50-year low in 2009 with 314 homicides.[296][297] This is a rate of 7.8 per 100,000—down from 1980, when it was 34.2.[c][298][299] In 2021, murders rose to their highest rate (8.5) since 2008, although by 2024 (6.1), the spike had receded.[300]
In 2015, it was revealed that the LAPD had been under-reporting a category of crime between 2005 and 2012, making the rate in the city appear lower than it was for that period.[301][302]
The Dragna crime family and Mickey Cohen dominated organized crime in the city during the Prohibition era[303] and reached its peak during the 1940s and 1950s with the ""Battle of Sunset Strip"" as part of the American Mafia, but has gradually declined since then with the rise of various black and Hispanic gangs in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[303]
According to the Los Angeles Police Department, the city is home to 45,000 gang members, organized into 450 gangs.[304] Among them are the Crips and Bloods, which are both African American street gangs that originated in the South Los Angeles region. Latino street gangs such as the Sureños, a Mexican American street gang, and Mara Salvatrucha, which has mainly members of Salvadoran descent, as well as other Central American descendants, all originated in Los Angeles. This has led to the city being referred to as the ""Gang Capital of America"".[305]
There are three public universities within the city limits: California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA), California State University, Northridge (CSUN) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).[306]
Private colleges in the city include:
The community college system consists of nine campuses governed by the trustees of the Los Angeles Community College District:
There are numerous additional colleges and universities outside the city limits in the Greater Los Angeles area, including the Claremont Colleges consortium, which includes the most selective liberal arts colleges in the U.S., and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), one of the top STEM-focused research institutions in the world.
Los Angeles Unified School District serves almost all of the city of Los Angeles, as well as several surrounding communities, with a student population of around 800,000.[337] After Proposition 13 was approved in 1978, urban school districts had considerable trouble with funding. LAUSD has become known for its underfunded, overcrowded, and poorly maintained campuses, although its 162 Magnet schools help compete with local private schools.
Several small sections of Los Angeles are in the Inglewood Unified School District,[338] and the Las Virgenes Unified School District.[339] The Los Angeles County Office of Education operates the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts.
The Los Angeles metro area is the second-largest broadcast designated market area in the U.S. (after New York) with 5,431,140 homes (4.956% of the U.S.), which is served by a wide variety of local AM and FM radio and television stations. Los Angeles and New York City are the only two media markets to have seven VHF allocations assigned to them.[340]
The major daily English-language newspaper in the area is the Los Angeles Times.[341] La Opinión is the city's major daily Spanish-language paper.[342] The Korea Times is the city's major daily Korean-language paper while The World Journal is the city and county's major Chinese newspaper. The Los Angeles Sentinel is the city's major African-American weekly paper, boasting the largest African-American readership in the Western United States.[343] Investor's Business Daily is distributed from its LA corporate offices, which are headquartered in Playa del Rey.[344]
As part of the region's aforementioned creative industry, the Big Five major broadcast television networks, ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, and The CW, all have production facilities and offices throughout various areas of Los Angeles. All four major broadcast television networks, plus major Spanish-language networks Telemundo and Univision, also own and operate stations that both serve the Los Angeles market and serve as each network's West Coast flagship station: ABC's KABC-TV (Channel 7),[345] CBS's KCBS-TV (Channel 2), Fox's KTTV-TV (Channel 11),[346] NBC's KNBC-TV (Channel 4),[347] The CW's KTLA-TV (Channel 5), MyNetworkTV's KCOP-TV (Channel 13), Telemundo's KVEA-TV (Channel 52), and Univision's KMEX-TV (Channel 34). The region also has four PBS member stations, with KCET re-joining the network as a secondary affiliate in August 2019, after spending the previous eight years as the nation's largest independent public television station. KTBN (Channel 40) is the flagship station of the religious Trinity Broadcasting Network, based out of Santa Ana. A variety of independent television stations, such as KCAL-TV (Channel 9), also operate in the area.
There are also a number of smaller regional newspapers, alternative weeklies and magazines, including the Los Angeles Register, Los Angeles Community News, (which focuses on coverage of the greater Los Angeles area), Los Angeles Daily News (which focuses coverage on the San Fernando Valley), LA Weekly, L.A. Record (which focuses coverage on the music scene in the Greater Los Angeles Area), Los Angeles Magazine, the Los Angeles Business Journal, the Los Angeles Daily Journal (legal industry paper), The Hollywood Reporter, Variety (both entertainment industry papers), and Los Angeles Downtown News.[348] In addition to the major papers, numerous local periodicals serve immigrant communities in their native languages, including Armenian, English, Korean, Persian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew, and Arabic. Many cities adjacent to Los Angeles also have their own daily newspapers whose coverage and availability overlap with certain Los Angeles neighborhoods. Examples include The Daily Breeze (serving the South Bay), and The Long Beach Press-Telegram.
Los Angeles arts, culture and nightlife news is also covered by a number of local and national online guides, including Time Out Los Angeles, Thrillist, Kristin's List, DailyCandy, Diversity News Magazine, LAist, and Flavorpill.[349][350][351][352]
The city and the rest of the Los Angeles metropolitan area are served by an extensive network of freeways and highways. Texas Transportation Institute's annual Urban Mobility Report ranked Los Angeles area roads the most congested in the United States in 2019, as measured by annual delay per traveler, area residents experiencing a cumulative average of 119 hours waiting in traffic that year.[353] Los Angeles was followed by San Francisco/Oakland, Washington, D.C., and Miami. Despite the congestion in the city, the mean daily travel time for commuters in Los Angeles is shorter than in other major cities, including New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Los Angeles's mean travel time for work commutes in 2006 was 29.2 minutes, similar to those of San Francisco and Washington, D.C.[354]
The major highways that connect LA to the rest of the nation include Interstate 5, which runs south through San Diego to Tijuana in Mexico and north through Sacramento, Portland, and Seattle to the Canada–US border; Interstate 10, the southernmost east–west, coast-to-coast Interstate Highway in the United States, going to Jacksonville, Florida; and U.S. Route 101, which heads to the California Central Coast, San Francisco, the Redwood Empire, and the Oregon and Washington coasts.
The Los Angeles Metro and other regional agencies provide a comprehensive bus system that covers Los Angeles County. While the Los Angeles Department of Transportation is responsible for contracting local and commuter bus services primarily within the city limits of Los Angeles and several immediate neighboring municipalities in southwest Los Angeles County,[355] the largest bus system in the city is operated by Metro.[356] Called Los Angeles Metro Bus, the system consists of 117 routes (excluding Metro Busway) throughout Los Angeles and neighboring cities primarily in southwestern Los Angeles County, with most routes following along a particular street in the city's street grid and run to or through downtown Los Angeles.[357] As of the third quarter of 2023, the system had an average ridership of approximately 692,500 per weekday, with a total of 197,950,700 riders in 2022.[358] Metro also runs two Metro Busway lines, the G and J lines, which are bus rapid transit lines with stops and frequencies similar to those of Los Angeles's light rail system.
There are also smaller regional public transit systems that mainly serve specific cities or regions in Los Angeles County. For example, the Big Blue Bus provides extensive bus service in Santa Monica and western Los Angeles County, while Foothill Transit focuses on routes in the San Gabriel Valley in southeast Los Angeles County, with one express route going into downtown Los Angeles. Los Angeles World Airports also runs two frequent FlyAway express bus routes (via freeways) from Los Angeles Union Station and Van Nuys to Los Angeles International Airport.[359]
While cash is accepted on all buses, the primary payment method for Los Angeles Metro Bus, Metro Busway, and 27 other regional bus agencies is a TAP card, a contactless stored-value card.[360] According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 9.2% of working Los Angeles (city) residents made the journey to work via public transportation.[361]
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority also operates a subway and light rail system across Los Angeles and its county. The system is called Los Angeles Metro Rail and consists of the B and D subway lines, as well as the A, C, E, and K light rail lines.[357] TAP cards are required for all Metro Rail trips.[362] As of the third quarter of 2023, the city's subway system is the ninth busiest in the United States, and its light rail system is the country's second busiest.[358] In 2022, the system had a ridership of 57,299,800, or about 189,200 per weekday, in the third quarter of 2023.[358]
Since the opening of the first line, the A Line, in 1990, the system has been extended significantly, with more extensions currently in progress. Today, the system serves numerous areas across the county on 107.4 mi (172.8 km) of rail, including Long Beach, Pasadena, Santa Monica, Norwalk, El Segundo, North Hollywood, Inglewood, and downtown Los Angeles. As of 2023, there are 101 stations in the Metro Rail system.[363]

Los Angeles is also the center of its county's commuter rail system, Metrolink, which links Los Angeles to Ventura, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego Counties. The system consists of eight lines and 69 stations operating on 545.6 miles (878.1 kilometers) of track.[364] Metrolink averages 42,600 trips per weekday, the busiest line being the San Bernardino Line.[365] Apart from Metrolink, Los Angeles is also connected to other cities by intercity passenger trains from Amtrak on five different lines.[366] One of the lines is the Pacific Surfliner route which operates multiple daily round trips between San Diego and San Luis Obispo, California through Union Station.[367] It is Amtrak's busiest line outside the Northeast Corridor.[368]The main rail station in the city is Union Station which opened in 1939, and it is the largest passenger rail terminal in the Western United States.[369] The station is a major regional train station for Amtrak, Metrolink and Metro Rail. The station is Amtrak's fifth busiest station, having 1.4 million Amtrak boardings and de-boardings in 2019.[370] Union Station also offers access to Metro Bus, Greyhound, LAX FlyAway, and other buses from different agencies.[371]
The main international and domestic airport serving Los Angeles is Los Angeles International Airport, commonly referred to by its airport code, LAX.[372] It is located on the Westside of Los Angeles near the Sofi Stadium in Inglewood.
Other major nearby commercial airports include:
One of the world's busiest general-aviation airports is also in Los Angeles: Van Nuys Airport.[376]
The Port of Los Angeles is in San Pedro Bay in the San Pedro neighborhood, approximately 20 miles (32 km) south of downtown. Also called Los Angeles Harbor and WORLDPORT LA, the port complex occupies 7,500 acres (30 km2) of land and water along 43 miles (69 km) of waterfront. It adjoins the separate Port of Long Beach.[377]
The sea ports of the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach together make up the Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbor.[378][379] Together, both ports are the fifth busiest container port in the world, with a trade volume of over 14.2 million TEU's in 2008.[380] Singly, the Port of Los Angeles is the busiest container port in the United States and the largest cruise ship center on the West Coast of the United States – The Port of Los Angeles's World Cruise Center served about 590,000 passengers in 2014.[381]
There are also smaller, non-industrial harbors along Los Angeles's coastline. The port includes four bridges: the Vincent Thomas Bridge, Henry Ford Bridge, Long Beach International Gateway Bridge, and Commodore Schuyler F. Heim Bridge. Passenger ferry service from San Pedro to the city of Avalon (and Two Harbors) on Santa Catalina Island is provided by Catalina Express.
Los Angeles has 25 sister cities,[382] listed chronologically by year joined:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States,United States,"
The United States of America (USA), also known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America. It is a federal republic of 50 states and a federal capital district, Washington, D.C. The 48 contiguous states border Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, with the semi-exclave of Alaska in the northwest and the archipelago of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. The United States also asserts sovereignty over five major island territories and various uninhabited islands in Oceania and the Caribbean.[j] It is a megadiverse country, with the world's third-largest land area[c] and third-largest population, exceeding 340 million.[k]
Paleo-Indians migrated from North Asia to North America over 12,000 years ago, and formed various civilizations. Spanish colonization established Spanish Florida in 1513, the first European colony in what is now the continental United States. British colonization followed with the 1607 settlement of Virginia, the first of the Thirteen Colonies. Enslavement of Africans was practiced in all the colonies by 1770, and it supplied most of the labor for the Southern Colonies' plantation economy. Clashes with the British Crown over taxation and lack of parliamentary representation sparked the American Revolution, leading to the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. Victory in the 1775–1783 Revolutionary War brought international recognition of U.S. sovereignty and fueled westward expansion, dispossessing native inhabitants. As more states were admitted, a North–South division over slavery led the Confederate States of America to attempt secession and fight the Union in the 1861–1865 American Civil War. With the United States' victory and reunification, slavery was abolished nationally. By 1900, the country had established itself as a great power, a status solidified after its involvement in World War I. Following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. Its aftermath left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as rival superpowers, competing for ideological dominance and international influence during the Cold War. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 ended the Cold War, leaving the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.
The U.S. national government is a presidential constitutional federal republic and representative democracy with three separate branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives (a lower house based on population) and the Senate (an upper house based on equal representation for each state). Federalism grants substantial autonomy to the 50 states. In addition, 574 Native American tribes have sovereignty rights, and there are 326 Native American reservations. Since the 1850s, the Democratic and Republican parties have dominated American politics, while American values are based on a democratic tradition inspired by the American Enlightenment movement. 
A developed country, the U.S. ranks high in economic competitiveness, innovation, and higher education. Accounting for over a quarter of nominal global GDP, its economy has been the world's largest since about 1890. It is the wealthiest country, with the highest disposable household income per capita among OECD members, though its wealth inequality is highly pronounced. Shaped by centuries of immigration, the culture of the U.S. is diverse and globally influential. Making up more than a third of global military spending, the country has one of the strongest militaries and is a designated nuclear state. A member of numerous international organizations, the U.S. plays a major role in global political, cultural, economic, and military affairs.
Documented use of the phrase ""United States of America"" dates back to January 2, 1776. On that day, Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, wrote a letter to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp, seeking to go ""with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain"" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[22][23] The first known public usage is an anonymous essay published in the Williamsburg newspaper The Virginia Gazette on April 6, 1776.[22] Sometime on or after June 11, 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote ""United States of America"" in a rough draft of the Declaration of Independence,[22] which was adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776.[24]
The term ""United States"" and its initialism ""U.S."", used as nouns or as adjectives in English, are common short names for the country. The initialism ""USA"", a noun, is also common.[25] ""United States"" and ""U.S."" are the established terms throughout the U.S. federal government, with prescribed rules.[l] ""The States"" is an established colloquial shortening of the name, used particularly from abroad;[27] ""stateside"" is the corresponding adjective or adverb.[28]
""America"" is the feminine form of the first word of Americus Vesputius, the Latinized name of Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci (1454–1512);[m] it was first used as a place name by the German cartographers Martin Waldseemüller and Matthias Ringmann in 1507.[29][n] Vespucci first proposed that the West Indies discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 were part of a previously unknown landmass and not among the Indies at the eastern limit of Asia.[30][31][32] In English, the term ""America"" usually does not refer to topics unrelated to the United States, despite the usage of ""the Americas"" to describe the totality of the continents of North and South America.[33]
The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia over 12,000 years ago, either across the Bering land bridge or along the now-submerged Ice Age coastline.[35][36] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to be the first widespread culture in the Americas.[37][38] Over time, Indigenous North American cultures grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the Mississippian culture, developed agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[39] In the post-archaic period, the Mississippian cultures were located in the midwestern, eastern, and southern regions, and the Algonquian in the Great Lakes region and along the Eastern Seaboard, while the Hohokam culture and Ancestral Puebloans inhabited the Southwest.[40] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants range from around 500,000[41][42] to nearly 10 million.[42][43]
Christopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean for Spain in 1492, leading to Spanish-speaking settlements and missions from what are now Puerto Rico and Florida to New Mexico and California. The first Spanish colony in the present-day continental United States was Spanish Florida, chartered in 1513.[44][45][46][47] After several settlements failed there due to hunger and disease, Spain's first permanent town, Saint Augustine, was founded in 1565.[48]
France established its own settlements in French Florida in 1562, but they were either abandoned (Charlesfort, 1578) or destroyed by Spanish raids (Fort Caroline, 1565). Permanent French settlements were founded much later along the Great Lakes (Fort Detroit, 1701), the Mississippi River (Saint Louis, 1764) and especially the Gulf of Mexico (New Orleans, 1718).[49] Early European colonies also included the thriving Dutch colony of New Nederland (settled 1626, present-day New York) and the small Swedish colony of New Sweden (settled 1638 in what became Delaware). British colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and the Plymouth Colony (Massachusetts, 1620).[50][51]
The Mayflower Compact in Massachusetts and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for local representative self-governance and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[52][53] While European settlers in what is now the United States experienced conflicts with Native Americans, they also engaged in trade, exchanging European tools for food and animal pelts.[54][o] Relations ranged from close cooperation to warfare and massacres. The colonial authorities often pursued policies that forced Native Americans to adopt European lifestyles, including conversion to Christianity.[58][59] Along the eastern seaboard, settlers trafficked African slaves through the Atlantic slave trade.[60]
The original Thirteen Colonies[p] that would later found the United States were administered as possessions of the British Empire by Crown-appointed governors,[61] though local governments held elections open to most white male property owners.[62][63] The colonial population grew rapidly from Maine to Georgia, eclipsing Native American populations;[64] by the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[65] The colonies' distance from Britain facilitated the entrenchment of self-governance,[66] and the First Great Awakening, a series of Christian revivals, fueled colonial interest in guaranteed religious liberty.[67]
Following their victory in the French and Indian War, Britain began to assert greater control over local colonial affairs, resulting in colonial political resistance; one of the primary colonial grievances was a denial of their rights as Englishmen, particularly the right to representation in the British government that taxed them. To demonstrate their dissatisfaction and resolve, the First Continental Congress met in 1774 and passed the Continental Association, a colonial boycott of British goods enforced by local ""committees of safety"" that proved effective. The British attempt to then disarm the colonists resulted in the 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, and created a committee that named Thomas Jefferson to draft the Declaration of Independence. Two days after passing the Lee Resolution to create an independent nation the Declaration was adopted on July 4, 1776.[68] The political values of the American Revolution included liberty, inalienable individual rights; and the sovereignty of the people;[69] supporting republicanism and rejecting monarchy, aristocracy, and all hereditary political power; civic virtue; and vilification of political corruption.[70] The Founding Fathers of the United States, who included Washington, Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, James Madison, Thomas Paine, and many others, were inspired by Classical, Renaissance, and Enlightenment philosophies and ideas.[71][72]
Though in practical effect since its drafting in 1777, the Articles of Confederation was ratified in 1781 and formally established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[68] After the British surrender at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, American sovereignty was internationally recognized by the Treaty of Paris (1783), through which the U.S. gained territory stretching west to the Mississippi River, north to present-day Canada, and south to Spanish Florida.[73] The Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the country's territory would expand with the admission of new states, rather than the expansion of existing states.[74]
The U.S. Constitution was drafted at the 1787 Constitutional Convention to overcome the limitations of the Articles. It went into effect in 1789, creating a federal republic governed by three separate branches that together formed a system of checks and balances.[75] George Washington was elected the country's first president under the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay skeptics' concerns about the power of the more centralized government.[76] His resignation as commander-in-chief after the Revolutionary War and his later refusal to run for a third term as the country's first president established a precedent for the supremacy of civil authority in the United States and the peaceful transfer of power.[77]
In the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward in larger numbers, many with a sense of manifest destiny.[78][79] The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 from France nearly doubled the territory of the United States.[80][81] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[82] Spain ceded Florida and its Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[83]
The Missouri Compromise of 1820, which admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, attempted to balance the desire of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery into new territories with that of southern states to extend it there. Primarily, the compromise prohibited slavery in all other lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36°30′ parallel.[84]
As Americans expanded further into territory inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government implemented policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[85][86] The most significant such legislation was the Indian Removal Act of 1830, a key policy of President Andrew Jackson. It resulted in the Trail of Tears (1830–1850), in which an estimated 60,000 Native Americans living east of the Mississippi River were forcibly removed and displaced to lands far to the west, causing 13,200 to 16,700 deaths along the forced march.[87] Settler expansion as well as this influx of Indigenous peoples from the East resulted in the American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi.[88][89]
During the colonial period, slavery became legal in all the Thirteen colonies, but by 1770 it provided the main labor force in the large-scale, agriculture-dependent economies of the Southern Colonies from Maryland to Georgia. The practice began to be significantly questioned during the American Revolution, [90] and spurred by an active abolitionist movement that had reemerged in the 1830s, states in the North enacted laws to prohibit slavery within their boundaries.[91] At the same time, support for slavery had strengthened in Southern states, with widespread use of inventions such as the cotton gin (1793) having made slavery immensely profitable for Southern elites.[92][93][94]
The United States annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845,[95] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[96] Dispute with Mexico over Texas led to the Mexican–American War (1846–1848). After the victory of the U.S., Mexico recognized U.S. sovereignty over Texas, New Mexico, and California in the 1848 Mexican Cession; the cession's lands also included the future states of Nevada, Colorado and Utah.[78][97] The California gold rush of 1848–1849 spurred a huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast, leading to even more confrontations with Native populations. One of the most violent, the California genocide of thousands of Native inhabitants, lasted into the mid-1870s.[98] Additional western territories and states were created.[99]
Throughout the 1850s, the sectional conflict regarding slavery was further inflamed by national legislation in the U.S. Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court. In Congress, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 mandated the forcible return to their owners in the South of slaves taking refuge in non-slave states, while the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 effectively gutted the anti-slavery requirements of the Missouri Compromise.[100] In its Dred Scott decision of 1857, the Supreme Court ruled against a slave brought into non-slave territory, simultaneously declaring the entire Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional. These and other events exacerbated tensions between North and South that would culminate in the American Civil War (1861–1865).[101][102]
Beginning with South Carolina, 11 slave-state governments voted to secede from the United States in 1861, joining to create the Confederate States of America. All other state governments remained loyal to the Union.[q][103][104] War broke out in April 1861 after the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter.[105][106] Following the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, many freed slaves joined the Union army.[107] The war began to turn in the Union's favor following the 1863 Siege of Vicksburg and Battle of Gettysburg, and the Confederates surrendered in 1865 after the Union's victory in the Battle of Appomattox Court House.[108]
Efforts toward reconstruction in the secessionist South had begun as early as 1862,[111] but it was only after President Lincoln's assassination that the three Reconstruction Amendments to the Constitution were ratified to protect civil rights. The amendments codified nationally the abolition of slavery and involuntary servitude except as punishment for crimes, promised equal protection under the law for all persons, and prohibited discrimination on the basis of race or previous enslavement.[112][113][114] As a result, African Americans took an active political role in ex-Confederate states in the decade following the Civil War.[115][116] The former Confederate states were readmitted to the Union, beginning with Tennessee in 1866 and ending with Georgia in 1870.[117][118]
National infrastructure, including transcontinental telegraph and railroads, spurred growth in the American frontier. This was accelerated by the Homestead Acts, through which nearly 10 percent of the total land area of the United States was given away free to some 1.6 million homesteaders.[119][120] From 1865 through 1917, an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe.[121] Most came through the Port of New York, and New York City and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations. Many Northern Europeans as well as significant numbers of Germans and other Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[122] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[123] Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[124]
The Compromise of 1877 is generally considered the end of the Reconstruction era, as it resolved the electoral crisis following the 1876 presidential election and led President Rutherford B. Hayes to reduce the role of federal troops in the South.[125] Immediately, the Redeemers began evicting the Carpetbaggers and quickly regained local control of Southern politics in the name of white supremacy.[126][127] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[128][129] A series of Supreme Court decisions, including Plessy v. Ferguson, emptied the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of their force, allowing Jim Crow laws in the South to remain unchecked, sundown towns in the Midwest, and segregation in communities across the country, which would be reinforced by the policy of redlining later adopted by the federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation.[130]
An explosion of technological advancement accompanied by the exploitation of cheap immigrant labor[131] led to rapid economic expansion during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, allowing the United States to outpace the economies of England, France, and Germany combined.[132][133] This fostered the amassing of power by a few prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[134] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. The United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[135] These changes resulted in significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, creating the environment for labor unions and socialist movements to begin to flourish.[136][137][138] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[139][140]
Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. That same year, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam were ceded to the U.S. by Spain after the latter's defeat in the Spanish–American War. (The Philippines was granted full independence from the U.S. on July 4, 1946, following World War II. Puerto Rico and Guam have remained U.S. territories.)[141] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[142] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[143]
The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies in 1917 helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[144] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[145] During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and early television transformed communications nationwide.[146] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, to which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal plan of ""reform, recovery and relief"", a series of unprecedented and sweeping recovery programs and employment relief projects combined with financial reforms and regulations.[147][148]
Initially neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war in December after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[149] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[150][151] The United States was one of the ""Four Policemen"" who met to plan the post-war world, alongside the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China.[152][153] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic power and international political influence.[154]
The end of World War II in 1945 left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as superpowers, each with its own political, military, and economic sphere of influence. Geopolitical tensions between the two superpowers soon led to the Cold War.[155][156][157] The U.S. utilized the policy of containment to limit the USSR's sphere of influence, engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with the Soviets, and prevailed in the Space Race, which culminated with the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.[158][159]
Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II.[160] The civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[161] The Great Society plan of President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration resulted in groundbreaking and broad-reaching laws, policies and a constitutional amendment to counteract some of the worst effects of lingering institutional racism.[162]
The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes toward recreational drug use and sexuality.[163][164] It also encouraged open defiance of the military draft (leading to the end of conscription in 1973)[165] and wide opposition to U.S. intervention in Vietnam, with the U.S. totally withdrawing in 1975.[166] A societal shift in the roles of women was significantly responsible for the large increase in female paid labor participation during the 1970s, and by 1985 the majority of American women aged 16 and older were employed.[167]
The Fall of Communism and the dissolution of the Soviet Union from 1989 to 1991 marked the end of the Cold War and left the United States as the world's sole superpower.[168][169][170][171] This cemented the United States' global influence, reinforcing the concept of the ""American Century"" as the U.S. dominated international political, cultural, economic, and military affairs.[172][173]
The 1990s saw the longest recorded economic expansion in American history, a dramatic decline in U.S. crime rates, and advances in technology. Throughout this decade, technological innovations such as the World Wide Web, the evolution of the Pentium microprocessor in accordance with Moore's law, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, the first gene therapy trial, and cloning either emerged in the U.S. or were improved upon there. The Human Genome Project was formally launched in 1990, while Nasdaq became the first stock market in the United States to trade online in 1998.[174]
In the Gulf War of 1991, an American-led international coalition of states expelled an Iraqi invasion force that had occupied neighboring Kuwait.[175] The September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001 by the pan-Islamist militant organization al-Qaeda led to the war on terror and subsequent military interventions in Afghanistan and in Iraq.[176][177]
The U.S. housing bubble culminated in 2007 with the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[178] In the 2010s and early 2020s, the United States has experienced increased political polarization and democratic backsliding.[179][180][181][182] The country's polarization was violently reflected in the January 2021 Capitol attack,[183] when a mob of insurrectionists[184] entered the U.S. Capitol and sought to prevent the peaceful transfer of power[185] in an attempted self-coup d'état.[186]
The United States is the world's third-largest country by total area behind Russia and Canada.[c] The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia have a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km2).[12][187] In 2021, the United States had 8% of the Earth's permanent meadows and pastures and 10% of its cropland.[188]
Starting in the east, the coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region.[189] The Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack Massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[190] The Mississippi River System, the world's fourth-longest river system, runs predominantly north–south through the center of the country. The flat and fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[190]
The Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[191] The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rocky Mountains, the Yellowstone Caldera, is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[192] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and the Chihuahuan, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts.[193] In the northwest corner of Arizona, carved by the Colorado River, is the Grand Canyon, a steep-sided canyon and popular tourist destination[194] known for its overwhelming visual size and intricate, colorful landscape. The Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the State of California,[195] about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[196]
At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali (also called Mount McKinley) is the highest peak in the country and on the continent.[197] Active volcanoes in the U.S. are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands. Located entirely outside North America, the archipelago of Hawaii consists of volcanic islands, physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania.[198]
In addition to its total land area, the United States has one of the world's largest marine exclusive economic zones spanning approximately 4.5 million square miles (11.7 million km2) of ocean.[199][200]
With its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[201] The western Great Plains are semi-arid.[202] Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii, the southern tip of Florida and U.S. territories in the Caribbean and Pacific are tropical.[203]
The United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country.[204][205] States bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley.[206] Due to climate change in the country, extreme weather has become more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves compared to the 1960s.[207][208][209] Since the 1990s, droughts in the American Southwest have become more persistent and more severe.[210] The regions considered as the most attractive to the population are the most vulnerable.[211]

The U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[213] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians,[214] and around 91,000 insect species.[215]
There are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed monuments, forests, and wilderness areas, administered by the National Park Service and other agencies.[216] About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed,[217] primarily in the Western States.[218] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for commercial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes.[219][220]
Environmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biodiversity, logging and deforestation,[221][222] and climate change.[223][224] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues.[225] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[226] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act.[227] In 2024, the U.S. ranked 35th among 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index.[228]
The United States is a federal republic of 50 states and a federal capital district, Washington, D.C. The U.S. asserts sovereignty over five unincorporated territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[19][229] It is the world's oldest surviving federation,[230] and its presidential system of national government has been adopted, in whole or in part, by many newly independent states worldwide following their decolonization.[231] The Constitution of the United States serves as the country's supreme legal document.[232] Most scholars describe the United States as a liberal democracy.[233][r]
Composed of three branches, all headquartered in Washington, D.C., the federal government is the national government of the United States. The U.S. Constitution establishes a separation of powers intended to provide a system of checks and balances to prevent any of the three branches from becoming supreme.[245]
The three-branch system is known as the presidential system, in contrast to the parliamentary system where the executive is part of the legislative body. Many countries around the world adopted this aspect of the 1789 Constitution of the United States, especially in the postcolonial Americas.[258]
In the U.S. federal system, sovereign powers are shared between three levels of government specified in the Constitution: the national government, the states, and Indian tribes.[259][260] The U.S. also asserts sovereignty over five permanently inhabited territories: American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.[19]
Residents of the 50 states are governed by their elected state government, under state constitutions compatible with the national constitution, and by elected local governments that are administrative divisions of a state.[261] States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and (except for Hawaii) further divided into municipalities, each administered by elected representatives. The District of Columbia is a federal district containing the U.S. capital, Washington, D.C.[262] The federal district is an administrative division of the federal government.[263]
Indian country is made up of 574 federally recognized tribes and 326 Indian reservations. They hold a government-to-government relationship with the U.S. federal government in Washington and are legally defined as domestic dependent nations with inherent tribal sovereignty rights.[260][259][264][265]
In addition to the five major territories, the U.S. also asserts sovereignty over the United States Minor Outlying Islands in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean.[19] The seven undisputed islands without permanent populations are Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, and Palmyra Atoll. U.S. sovereignty over the unpopulated Bajo Nuevo Bank, Navassa Island, Serranilla Bank, and Wake Island is disputed.[19]
The Constitution is silent on political parties. However, they developed independently in the 18th century with the Federalist and Anti-Federalist parties.[266] Since then, the United States has operated as a de facto two-party system, though the parties have changed over time.[267] Since the mid-19th century, the two main national parties have been the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The former is perceived as relatively liberal in its political platform while the latter is perceived as relatively conservative in its platform.[268]
The United States has an established structure of foreign relations, with the world's second-largest diplomatic corps as of 2024[update]. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council[269] and home to the United Nations headquarters.[270] The United States is a member of the G7,[271] G20,[272] and OECD intergovernmental organizations.[273] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all countries host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,[274] North Korea,[275] and Bhutan.[276] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations.[277] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[278] Its geopolitical attention also turned to the Indo-Pacific when the United States joined the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with Australia, India, and Japan.[279]
The United States has a ""Special Relationship"" with the United Kingdom[280] and strong ties with Canada,[281] Australia,[282] New Zealand,[283] the Philippines,[284] Japan,[285] South Korea,[286] Israel,[287] and several European Union countries such as France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland.[288] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with countries in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States–Mexico–Canada Free Trade Agreement. The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[255] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India,[289] while its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.[290][291]
Beginning in 2014, the U.S. had become a key ally of Ukraine.[292][293] After Donald Trump was elected U.S. president in 2024, he sought to negotiate an end to the Russo-Ukrainian War. He paused all military aid to Ukraine in March 2025,[294] although the aid resumed later.[295] Trump also ended U.S. intelligence sharing with the country,[296] but this too was eventually restored.[297]
The president is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Department of Defense, which is headquartered at the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., administers five of the six service branches, which are made up of the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force.[298] The Coast Guard is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and can be transferred to the Department of the Navy in wartime.[299]
The United States spent $997 billion on its military in 2024, which is by far the largest amount of any country, making up 37% of global military spending and accounting for 3.4% of the country's GDP.[300] The U.S. possesses 42% of the world's nuclear weapons—the second-largest stockpile after that of Russia.[301] The U.S. military is widely regarded as the most powerful and advanced in the world.[302][303]
The United States has the third-largest combined armed forces in the world, behind the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Indian Armed Forces.[304] The U.S. military operates about 800 bases and facilities abroad,[305] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[306] The United States has engaged in over 400 military interventions since its founding in 1776, with over half of these occurring between 1950 and 2019 and 25% occurring in the post-Cold War era.[307]
State defense forces (SDFs) are military units that operate under the sole authority of a state government. SDFs are authorized by state and federal law but are under the command of the state's governor.[308][309][310]
By contrast, a state's National Guard units are under the dual control of state and federal governments; such units can also become federalized entities, but SDFs cannot be federalized.[311] A state's National Guard personnel can be federalized by the president under the National Defense Act Amendments of 1933, which created the Guard and provides for the integration of Army National Guard & Air National Guard units and personnel into the U.S. Army and (since 1947) the U.S. Air Force.[312]
There are about 18,000 U.S. police agencies from local to national level in the United States.[313] Law in the United States is mainly enforced by local police departments and sheriff departments in their municipal or county jurisdictions. The state police departments have authority in their respective state, and federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have national jurisdiction and specialized duties, such as protecting civil rights, national security, enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws, and interstate criminal activity.[314] State courts conduct almost all civil and criminal trials,[315] while federal courts adjudicate the much smaller number of civil and criminal cases that relate to federal law.[316]
There is no unified ""criminal justice system"" in the United States. The American prison system is largely heterogenous, with thousands of relatively independent systems operating across federal, state, local, and tribal levels. In 2025, ""these systems hold nearly 2 million people in 1,566 state prisons, 98 federal prisons, 3,116 local jails, 1,277 juvenile correctional facilities, 133 immigration detention facilities, and 80 Indian country jails, as well as in military prisons, civil commitment centers, state psychiatric hospitals, and prisons in the U.S. territories.""[317]
Despite disparate systems of confinement, four main institutions dominate: federal prisons, state prisons, local jails, and juvenile correctional facilities.[318] Federal prisons are run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons and hold pretrial detainees as well as people who have been convicted of federal crimes.[318] State prisons, run by the department of corrections of each state, hold people sentenced and serving prison time (usually longer than one year) for felony offenses.[318] Local jails are county or municipal facilities that incarcerate defendants prior to trial; they also hold those serving short sentences (typically under a year).[318] Juvenile correctional facilities are operated by local or state governments and serve as longer-term placements for any minor adjudicated as delinquent and ordered by a judge to be confined.[319]
In January 2023, the United States had the sixth-highest per capita incarceration rate in the world—531 people per 100,000 inhabitants—and the largest prison and jail population in the world, with more than 1.9 million people incarcerated.[317][320][321] An analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed U.S. homicide rates ""were 7 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25 times higher"".[322]
The U.S. has a highly developed mixed economy[323] that has been the world's largest nominally since about 1890.[324] Its 2024 gross domestic product (GDP)[e] of more than $29 trillion[325] constituted over 25% of nominal global economic output, or 15% at purchasing power parity (PPP). From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7.[326] The country ranks first in the world by nominal GDP,[327] second when adjusted for purchasing power parities (PPP),[15] and ninth by PPP-adjusted GDP per capita.[15] In February 2024, the total U.S. federal government debt was $34.4 trillion.[328]
Of the world's 500 largest companies by revenue, 138 were headquartered in the U.S. in 2025,[329] which is the highest number of any country.[330] The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and the world's foremost reserve currency, backed by the country's dominant economy, its military, the petrodollar system, its large U.S. treasuries market, and its linked eurodollar.[331] Several countries use it as their official currency, and in others it is the de facto currency.[332][333] The U.S. has free trade agreements with several countries, including the USMCA.[334] Although the United States has reached a post-industrial level of economic development[335] and is often described as having a service economy,[335][336] it remains a major industrial power;[337] in 2024, the U.S. manufacturing sector was the world's second-largest by value output after China's.[338]
New York City is the world's principal financial center,[340][341] and its metropolitan area is the world's largest metropolitan economy.[342] The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, both located in New York City, are the world's two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and trade volume.[343][344] The United States is at the forefront of technological advancement and innovation in many economic fields, especially in artificial intelligence; electronics and computers; pharmaceuticals; and medical, aerospace and military equipment.[345] The country's economy is fueled by abundant natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity.[346] The largest trading partners of the United States are the European Union, Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, India, and Taiwan.[347] The United States is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter.[t] It is by far the world's largest exporter of services.[350]
Americans have the highest average household[351] and employee income among OECD member states, and the fourth-highest median household income in 2023,[352] up from sixth-highest in 2013.[353] With personal consumption expenditures of over $18.5 trillion in 2023,[354] the U.S. has a heavily consumer-driven economy and is the world's largest consumer market.[355] The U.S. ranked first in the number of dollar billionaires and millionaires in 2023, with 735 billionaires and nearly 22 million millionaires.[356]
Wealth in the United States is highly concentrated; in 2011, the richest 10% of the adult population owned 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom 50% owned just 2%.[357] U.S. wealth inequality increased substantially since the late 1980s,[358] and income inequality in the U.S. reached a record high in 2019.[359] In 2024, the country had some of the highest wealth and income inequality levels among OECD countries.[360] Since the 1970s, there has been a decoupling of U.S. wage gains from worker productivity.[361] In 2016, the top fifth of earners took home more than half of all income,[362] giving the U.S. one of the widest income distributions among OECD countries.[363][361] There were about 771,480 homeless persons in the U.S. in 2024.[364] In 2022, 6.4 million children experienced food insecurity.[365] Feeding America estimates that around one in five, or approximately 13 million, children experience hunger in the U.S. and do not know where or when they will get their next meal.[366] Also in 2022, about 37.9 million people, or 11.5% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty.[367]
The United States has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than most other high-income countries.[368][369] It is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation nationally[370] and one of a few countries in the world without federal paid family leave as a legal right.[371] The United States has a higher percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed country, largely because of a weak collective bargaining system and lack of government support for at-risk workers.[372]
The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century.[375] Methods for producing interchangeable parts and the establishment of a machine tool industry enabled the large-scale manufacturing of U.S. consumer products in the late 19th century.[376] By the early 20th century, factory electrification, the introduction of the assembly line, and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production.[377]
In the 21st century, the United States continues to be one of the world's foremost scientific powers,[378] though China has emerged as a major competitor in many fields.[379] The U.S. has the highest research and development expenditures of any country[380] and ranks ninth as a percentage of GDP.[381] In 2022, the United States was (after China) the country with the second-highest number of published scientific papers.[382] In 2021, the U.S. ranked second (also after China) by the number of patent applications, and third by trademark and industrial design applications (after China and Germany), according to World Intellectual Property Indicators.[383] In 2025[384][385] the United States ranked third (after Switzerland and Sweden) in the Global Innovation Index. The United States is considered to be the leading country in the development of artificial intelligence technology.[386] In 2023, the United States was ranked the second most technologically advanced country in the world (after South Korea) by Global Finance magazine.[387]
The United States has maintained a space program since the late 1950s, beginning with the establishment of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958.[388][389] NASA's Apollo program (1961–1972) achieved the first crewed Moon landing with the 1969 Apollo 11 mission; it remains one of the agency's most significant milestones.[390][391] Other major endeavors by NASA include the Space Shuttle program (1981–2011),[392] the Voyager program (1972–present), the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes (launched in 1990 and 2021, respectively),[393][394] and the multi-mission Mars Exploration Program (Spirit and Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance).[395] NASA is one of five agencies collaborating on the International Space Station (ISS);[396] U.S. contributions to the ISS include several modules, including Destiny (2001), Harmony (2007), and Tranquility (2010), as well as ongoing logistical and operational support.[397]
The United States private sector dominates the global commercial spaceflight industry.[398] Prominent American spaceflight contractors include Blue Origin, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and SpaceX. NASA programs such as the Commercial Crew Program, Commercial Resupply Services, Commercial Lunar Payload Services, and NextSTEP have facilitated growing private-sector involvement in American spaceflight.[399]
In 2023, the United States received approximately 84% of its energy from fossil fuel, and its largest source of energy was petroleum (38%), followed by natural gas (36%), renewable sources (9%), coal (9%), and nuclear power (9%).[400][401] In 2022, the United States constituted about 4% of the world's population, but consumed around 16% of the world's energy.[402] The U.S. ranks as the second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases behind China.[403]
The U.S. is the world's largest producer of nuclear power, generating around 30% of the world's nuclear electricity.[404] It also has the highest number of nuclear power reactors of any country.[405] From 2024, the U.S. plans to triple its nuclear power capacity by 2050.[406]
The United States' 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of road network, owned almost entirely by state and local governments, is the longest in the world.[407][408] The extensive Interstate Highway System that connects all major U.S. cities is funded mostly by the federal government but maintained by state departments of transportation. The system is further extended by state highways and some private toll roads.
The U.S. is among the top ten countries with the highest vehicle ownership per capita (850 vehicles per 1,000 people) in 2022. A 2022 study found that 76% of U.S. commuters drive alone and 14% ride a bicycle, including bike owners and users of bike-sharing networks. About 11% use some form of public transportation.[409][410]
Public transportation in the United States is well developed in the largest urban areas, notably New York City, Washington, D.C., Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco; otherwise, coverage is generally less extensive than in most other developed countries. The U.S. also has many relatively car-dependent localities.[411]
Long-distance intercity travel is provided primarily by airlines, but travel by rail is more common along the Northeast Corridor, the only high-speed rail in the U.S. that meets international standards. Amtrak, the country's government-sponsored national passenger rail company, has a relatively sparse network compared to that of Western European countries. Service is concentrated in the Northeast, California, the Midwest, the Pacific Northwest, and Virginia/Southeast.
The United States has an extensive air transportation network. U.S. civilian airlines are all privately owned. The three largest airlines in the world, by total number of passengers carried, are U.S.-based; American Airlines became the global leader after its 2013 merger with US Airways.[414] Of the 50 busiest airports in the world, 16 are in the United States, as well as five of the top 10.[415] The world's busiest airport by passenger volume is Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International in Atlanta, Georgia.[412][415] In 2022, most of the 19,969 U.S. airports[416] were owned and operated by local government authorities, and there are also some private airports. Some 5,193 are designated as ""public use"", including for general aviation. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has provided security at most major airports since 2001.
The country's rail transport network, the longest in the world at 182,412.3 mi (293,564.2 km),[417] handles mostly freight[418][419] (in contrast to more passenger-centered rail in Europe[420]). Because they are often privately owned operations, U.S. railroads lag behind those of the rest of the world in terms of electrification.[421]
The country's inland waterways are the world's fifth-longest, totaling 25,482 mi (41,009 km).[422] They are used extensively for freight, recreation, and a small amount of passenger traffic. Of the world's 50 busiest container ports, four are located in the United States, with the busiest in the U.S. being the Port of Los Angeles.[423]
The U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents on April 1, 2020,[u][425] making the United States the third-most-populous country in the world, after China and India.[345] The Census Bureau's official 2024 population estimate was 340,110,988, an increase of 2.6% since the 2020 census.[13] According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on July 1, 2024, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 16 seconds, or about 5400 people per day.[426] In 2023, 51% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 34% had never been married.[427] In 2023, the total fertility rate for the U.S. stood at 1.6 children per woman,[428] and, at 23%, it had the world's highest rate of children living in single-parent households in 2019.[429]
The United States has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[430] White Americans with ancestry from Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the United States population.[431][432] Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the United States population. African Americans constitute the country's third-largest ancestry group and are 12.1% of the total U.S. population.[430] Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 5.9% of the United States population. The country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1%,[430] and some 574 native tribes are recognized by the federal government.[433] In 2024, the median age of the United States population was 39.1 years.[434]
While many languages are spoken in the United States, English is by far the most commonly spoken and written.[435] De facto, English is the official language of the United States, and in 2025, Executive Order 14224 declared English official.[4] However, the U.S. has never had a de jure official language, as Congress has never passed a law to designate English as official for all three federal branches. Some laws, such as U.S. naturalization requirements, nonetheless standardize English. Twenty-eight states and the United States Virgin Islands have laws that designate English as the sole official language; 19 states and the District of Columbia have no official language.[436] Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English: Hawaii (Hawaiian),[437] Alaska (twenty Native languages),[v][438] South Dakota (Sioux),[439] American Samoa (Samoan), Puerto Rico (Spanish), Guam (Chamorro), and the Northern Mariana Islands (Carolinian and Chamorro). In total, 169 Native American languages are spoken in the United States.[440] In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.[441]
According to the American Community Survey (2020),[442] some 245.4 million people in the U.S. age five and older spoke only English at home. About 41.2 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (3.40 million), Tagalog (1.71 million), Vietnamese (1.52 million), Arabic (1.39 million), French (1.18 million), Korean (1.07 million), and Russian (1.04 million). German, spoken by 1 million people at home in 2010, fell to 857,000 total speakers in 2020.[443]
America's immigrant population is by far the world's largest in absolute terms.[444][445] In 2022, there were 87.7 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for nearly 27% of the overall U.S. population.[446] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants.[447] In 2019, the top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico (24% of immigrants), India (6%), China (5%), the Philippines (4.5%), and El Salvador (3%).[448] In fiscal year 2022, over one million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification) were granted legal residence.[449] The undocumented immigrant population in the U.S. reached a record high of 14 million in 2023.[450]
The First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion in the country and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment.[451][452] Religious practice is widespread, among the most diverse in the world,[453] and profoundly vibrant.
[454] The country has the world's largest Christian population, which includes the fourth-largest population of Catholics.[455] Other notable faiths include Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, New Age, and Native American religions.[456] Religious practice varies significantly by region.[457] ""Ceremonial deism"" is common in American culture.[458]
The overwhelming majority of Americans believe in a higher power or spiritual force, engage in spiritual practices such as prayer, and consider themselves religious or spiritual.[459][460] In the Southern United States' ""Bible Belt"", evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role culturally; New England and the Western United States tend to be more secular.[457][461] Mormonism, a Restorationist movement founded in the U.S. in 1847,[462] is the predominant religion in Utah and a major religion in Idaho.
About 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[345] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[463] In 2022, 333 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities—New York City, Los Angeles,  Chicago, and Houston—had populations exceeding two million.[464] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[465]

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), average American life expectancy at birth was 78.4 years in 2023 (75.8 years for men and 81.1 years for women). This was a gain of 0.9 year from 77.5 years in 2022, and the CDC noted that the new average was largely driven by ""decreases in mortality due to COVID-19, heart disease, unintentional injuries, cancer and diabetes"".[470] Starting in 1998, life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' ""health disadvantage"" gap has been increasing ever since.[471]
The Commonwealth Fund reported in 2020 that the U.S. had the highest suicide rate among high-income countries.[472] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[473] The U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other country, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer countries for reasons that are debated.[474] The United States is the only developed country without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.[475] Government-funded healthcare coverage for the poor (Medicaid) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, then-President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[w][476] Abortion in the United States is not federally protected, and is illegal or restricted in 17 states.[477]
American primary and secondary education, known in the U.S. as K–12 (""kindergarten through 12th grade""), is decentralized. School systems are operated by state, territorial, and sometimes municipal governments and regulated by the U.S. Department of Education. In general, children are required to attend school or an approved homeschool from the age of five or six (kindergarten or first grade) until they are 18 years old. This often brings students through the 12th grade, the final year of a U.S. high school, but some states and territories allow them to leave school earlier, at age 16 or 17.[479] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any other country,[480] an average of $18,614 per year per public elementary and secondary school student in 2020–2021.[481] Among Americans age 25 and older, 92.2% graduated from high school, 62.7% attended some college, 37.7% earned a bachelor's degree, and 14.2% earned a graduate degree.[482] The U.S. literacy rate is near-universal.[345][483] The U.S. has produced the most Nobel Prize winners of any country, with 411 (having won 413 awards).[484][485]
U.S. tertiary or higher education has earned a global reputation. Many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25.[486][487] American higher education is dominated by state university systems, although the country's many private universities and colleges enroll about 20% of all American students. Local community colleges generally offer open admissions, lower tuition, and coursework leading to a two-year associate degree or a non-degree certificate.[488]
As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and Americans spend more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[489] Colleges and universities directly funded by the federal government do not charge tuition and are limited to military personnel and government employees, including: the U.S. service academies, the Naval Postgraduate School, and military staff colleges. Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[490] student loan debt increased by 102% between 2010 and 2020,[491] and exceeded $1.7 trillion in 2022.[492]
The United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[494][495] The country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy,[496][497] as well as a strong work ethic[498] and competitiveness.[499] Voluntary altruism towards others also plays a major role;[500][501][502] according to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity—the highest rate in the world by a large margin.[503] Americans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an ""American Creed"" emphasizing consent of the governed, liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[504][505] The U.S. has acquired significant hard and soft power through its diplomatic influence, economic power, military alliances, and cultural exports such as American movies, music, video games, sports, and food.[506][507] The influence that the United States exerts on other countries through soft power is referred to as Americanization.[508]
Nearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Europe, Africa, or Asia (the ""Old World"") within the past five centuries.[509] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[510] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture.
Under the First Amendment to the Constitution, the United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country.[511] Flag desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese majesty are all forms of protected expression.[512][513][514] A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured.[515] Additionally, they are the ""most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship"".[516] The U.S. is a socially progressive country[517] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality.[518] LGBTQ rights in the United States are among the most advanced by global standards.[518][519][520]
The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high levels of social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[521][522] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[523][524][525] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[526] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[527][528] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[529]
The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities is an agency of the United States federal government that was established in 1965 with the purpose to ""develop and promote a broadly conceived national policy of support for the humanities and the arts in the United States, and for institutions which preserve the cultural heritage of the United States.""[530] It is composed of four sub-agencies:
Colonial American authors were influenced by John Locke and other Enlightenment philosophers.[532][533] The American Revolutionary Period (1765–1783) is notable for the political writings of Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Jefferson. Shortly before and after the Revolutionary War, the newspaper rose to prominence, filling a demand for anti-British national literature.[534][535] An early novel is William Hill Brown's The Power of Sympathy, published in 1791. Writer and critic John Neal in the early- to mid-19th century helped advance America toward a unique literature and culture by criticizing predecessors such as Washington Irving for imitating their British counterparts, and by influencing writers such as Edgar Allan Poe,[536] who took American poetry and short fiction in new directions. Ralph Waldo Emerson and Margaret Fuller pioneered the influential Transcendentalism movement;[537][538] Henry David Thoreau, author of Walden, was influenced by this movement.
The conflict surrounding abolitionism inspired writers, like Harriet Beecher Stowe, and authors of slave narratives, such as Frederick Douglass. Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (1850) explored the dark side of American history, as did Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851). Major American poets of the 19th century American Renaissance include Walt Whitman, Melville, and Emily Dickinson.[539][540] Mark Twain was the first major American writer to be born in the West. Henry James achieved international recognition with novels like The Portrait of a Lady (1881). As literacy rates rose, periodicals published more stories centered around industrial workers, women, and the rural poor.[541][542] Naturalism, regionalism, and realism were the major literary movements of the period.[543][544]
While modernism generally took on an international character, modernist authors working within the United States more often rooted their work in specific regions, peoples, and cultures.[545] Following the Great Migration to northern cities, African-American and black West Indian authors of the Harlem Renaissance developed an independent tradition of literature that rebuked a history of inequality and celebrated black culture. An important cultural export during the Jazz Age, these writings were a key influence on Négritude, a philosophy emerging in the 1930s among francophone writers of the African diaspora.[546][547] In the 1950s, an ideal of homogeneity led many authors to attempt to write the Great American Novel,[548] while the Beat Generation rejected this conformity, using styles that elevated the impact of the spoken word over mechanics to describe drug use, sexuality, and the failings of society.[549][550] Contemporary literature is more pluralistic than in previous eras, with the closest thing to a unifying feature being a trend toward self-conscious experiments with language.[551] Twelve American laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Literature.[552]
Media in the United States is broadly uncensored, with the First Amendment providing significant protections, as reiterated in New York Times Co. v. United States.[511] The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. The U.S. cable television system offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[553] In 2021, about 83% of Americans over age 12 listened to broadcast radio, while about 40% listened to podcasts.[554] In the prior year, there were 15,460 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[555] Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.[556]
U.S. newspapers with a global reach and reputation include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and USA Today.[557] About 800 publications are produced in Spanish.[558][559] With few exceptions, newspapers are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in an increasingly rare situation, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as The Village Voice in New York City and LA Weekly in Los Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Facebook, Amazon, and Reddit—all of them American-owned.[560]
In 2025, the U.S. video game market was the world's second-largest by revenue (after China's).[561] In 2015, the U.S. video game industry consisted of 2,457 companies that employed around 220,000 jobs and generated $30.4 billion in revenue.[562] There are 444 game publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone.[563] According to the Game Developers Conference (GDC), the U.S. is the top location for video game development, with 58% of the world's game developers based there in 2025.[564]
The United States is well known for its theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater.[565] By the middle of the 19th century, America had created new distinct dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show.[566] The central hub of the American theater scene is the Theater District in Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.[567]
Many movie and television celebrities have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture.[568]
The Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theater and are presented at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theater. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.[569]
Folk art in colonial America grew out of artisanal craftsmanship in communities that allowed commonly trained people to individually express themselves. It was distinct from Europe's tradition of high art, which was less accessible and generally less relevant to early American settlers.[571] Cultural movements in art and craftsmanship in colonial America generally lagged behind those of Western Europe. For example, the prevailing medieval style of woodworking and primitive sculpture became integral to early American folk art, despite the emergence of Renaissance styles in England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The new English styles would have been early enough to make a considerable impact on American folk art, but American styles and forms had already been firmly adopted. Not only did styles change slowly in early America, but there was a tendency for rural artisans there to continue their traditional forms longer than their urban counterparts did—and far longer than those in Western Europe.[511]
The Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the visual arts tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[572]
American Realism and American Regionalism sought to reflect and give America new ways of looking at itself. Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new and individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.[573]
The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[574] The Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan is the largest art museum in the United States[575] and the fourth-largest in the world.[576]
American folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, mainland Europe, or Africa.[577] The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music in particular have influenced American music.[578] Banjos were brought to America through the slave trade. Minstrel shows incorporating the instrument into their acts led to its increased popularity and widespread production in the 19th century.[579][580] The electric guitar, first invented in the 1930s, and mass-produced by the 1940s, had an enormous influence on popular music, in particular due to the development of rock and roll.[581] The synthesizer, turntablism, and electronic music were also largely developed in the U.S.
Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz grew from blues and ragtime in the early 20th century, developing from the innovations and recordings of composers such as W.C. Handy and Jelly Roll Morton. Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington increased its popularity early in the 20th century.[582] Country music developed in the 1920s,[583] bluegrass[584] and rhythm and blues in the 1940s,[585] and rock and roll in the 1950s.[581] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[586] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States in the 1970s.[587]
The United States has the world's largest music market, with a total retail value of $15.9 billion in 2022.[588] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[589] Mid-20th-century American pop stars, such as Frank Sinatra[590] and Elvis Presley,[591] became global celebrities and best-selling music artists,[582] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Michael Jackson,[592] Madonna,[593] Whitney Houston,[594] and Mariah Carey,[595] and of the early 21st century, such as Eminem,[596] Britney Spears,[597] Lady Gaga,[597] Katy Perry,[597] Taylor Swift and Beyoncé.[598]
The United States has the world's largest apparel market by revenue.[599] Apart from professional business attire, American fashion is eclectic and predominantly informal. Americans' diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing; however, sneakers, jeans, T-shirts, and baseball caps are emblematic of American styles.[600] New York, with its Fashion Week, is considered to be one of the ""Big Four"" global fashion capitals, along with Paris, Milan, and London. A study demonstrated that general proximity to Manhattan's Garment District has been synonymous with American fashion since its inception in the early 20th century.[601]
A number of well-known designer labels, among them Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Tom Ford and Calvin Klein, are headquartered in Manhattan.[602][603] Labels cater to niche markets, such as preteens. New York Fashion Week is one of the most influential fashion shows in the world, and is held twice each year in Manhattan;[604] the annual Met Gala, also in Manhattan, has been called the fashion world's ""biggest night"".[605][606]
The U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is also metonymous for the American filmmaking industry.[607][608][609] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful movies selling the most tickets in the world.[610][611]
Largely centered in the New York City region from its beginnings in the late 19th century through the first decades of the 20th century,[612][613][614][615] the U.S. film industry has since been primarily based in and around Hollywood. Nonetheless, American film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization in the 21st century, and an increasing number of films are made elsewhere.[616] The Academy Awards, popularly known as ""the Oscars"", have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[617] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[618]
The industry peaked in what is commonly referred to as the ""Golden Age of Hollywood"", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[619] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[620][621] In the 1970s, ""New Hollywood"", or the ""Hollywood Renaissance"",[622] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[623] The 21st century has been marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, which came to rival traditional cinema.[624][625]
Early settlers were introduced by Native Americans to foods such as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they were familiar with, such as wheat flour,[626] beef, and milk, to create a distinctive American cuisine.[627][628] New World crops, especially pumpkin, corn, potatoes, and turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on Thanksgiving, when many Americans prepare or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[629]
Characteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, hamburgers, hot dogs, and American pizza derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[630][631][632][633] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and adaptations of Chinese cuisine as well as pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[634]
American chefs have had a significant impact on society both domestically and internationally. In 1946, the Culinary Institute of America was founded by Katharine Angell and Frances Roth. This would become the United States' most prestigious culinary school, where many of the most talented American chefs would study prior to successful careers.[635][636] The United States restaurant industry was projected at $899 billion in sales for 2020,[637][638] and employed more than 15 million people, representing 10% of the nation's workforce directly.[637] It is the country's second-largest private employer and the third-largest employer overall.[639][640] The United States is home to over 220 Michelin star-rated restaurants, 70 of which are in New York City alone.[641]
Wine has been produced in what is now the United States since the 1500s, with the first widespread production beginning in what is now New Mexico in 1628.[642][643][644] In the modern U.S., wine production is undertaken in all fifty states, with California producing 84 percent of all U.S. wine. With more than 1,100,000 acres (4,500 km2) under vine, the United States is the fourth-largest wine-producing country in the world, after Italy, Spain, and France.[645][646]
The classic American diner, a casual restaurant type originally intended for the working class, emerged during the 19th century from converted railroad dining cars made stationary. The diner soon evolved into purpose-built structures whose number expanded greatly in the 20th century.[647] The American fast-food industry developed alongside the nation's car culture.[648] American restaurants developed the drive-in format in the 1920s, which they began to replace with the drive-through format by the 1940s.[649][650] American fast-food restaurant chains, such as McDonald's, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Dunkin' Donuts and many others, have numerous outlets around the world.[651]
The most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey.[652] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, many of which have become popular worldwide.[653] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[654] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69 billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[655]
American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[656] the National Football League has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[657] However, baseball has been regarded as the U.S. ""national sport"" since the late 19th century. After American football, the next four most popular professional team sports are basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey. Their premier leagues are, respectively, the National Basketball Association,[658] Major League Baseball,[659] Major League Soccer,[660] and the National Hockey League.[661] The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[662][663]
On the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[664] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA March Madness tournament and the College Football Playoff are some of the most watched national sporting events.[665] In the U.S., the intercollegiate sports level serves as the main feeder system for professional and Olympic sports, with significant exceptions such as Minor League Baseball. This differs greatly from practices in nearly all other countries, where publicly and privately funded sports organizations serve this function.[666]
Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[667] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,968 medals (1,179 gold) at the Olympic Games, the most of any country.[668][669][670]
In other international competition, the United States is the home of a number of prestigious events, including the Americas Cup, World Baseball Classic, the U.S. Open, and the Masters Tournament. The U.S. men's national soccer team has qualified for eleven World Cups, while the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[671] The 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup was hosted by the United States. Its final match was attended by 90,185, setting the world record for largest women's sporting event crowd at the time.[672] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[673]

""Pigeons from Hell"" is a Southern Gothic horror story by American writer Robert E. Howard, written in late 1934 and published posthumously by Weird Tales in 1938. It has been reprinted dozens of times, often in ""Best Of"" and ""Hall of Fame"" anthologies, and translated into several languages.[1]
Two men traveling through the American South spend the night in a haunted house and encounter a grisly reality of voodoo and zombies. The title comes from an image of the ghost stories told by Howard's grandmother, especially one about a deserted plantation mansion haunted by pigeons.[2] The one-line introduction, by Weird Tales editor Farnsworth Wright, read: ""A fearsome story of frightful death, a whistle in the dark, and three women whose bodies hung in that dreadful room of horrors — by a late great master of weird fiction.""[3]
""Pigeons from Hell"" was nominated for the 2014 Retrospective Hugo Award for Best Novelette, losing to science fiction author Clifford D. Simak's  ""Rule 18"".[4]
""Pigeons from Hell"" is a horror novelette of three chapters, separately titled ""The Whistler in the Dark"", ""The Snake's Brother"", and ""The Call of Zuvembie"".
Two New Englanders, John Branner and his friend Griswell, travel across the South and spend the night in a deserted plantation manor. Griswell awakens from a dream about a yellow-faced creature looking at him. He then sees Branner walk up the stairs in a trance. He is horrified when Branner returns as an animated corpse, gripping the bloody axe that had split his skull. Griswell flees into the woods.
In his flight, he meets the county's sheriff, Buckner, who investigates the house and finds Branner motionless on the floor. Griswell is implicated in his friend's murder, but the sheriff gives him the benefit of a doubt and tries to clear his name. Buckner gives some credence towards Griswell's bizarre tale due to the manor's ominous reputation. It was formerly the Blassenvilles' residence, a family from the West Indies who were known for their cruelty.
After the American Civil War, the Blassenvilles fell into poverty, with all their male members dead and only four sisters remaining, shortly to be joined by their Aunt Celia from the West Indies and her mulatta maid Joan. Celia mistreated Joan, and when the latter disappeared, it was thought she had run away. Soon after, Celia vanished as well, and it was thought that she had returned to the West Indies. Over the next months, three of the Blassenville sisters also vanished one by one. One night in 1890, the last of the Blassenvilles, Elizabeth, fled the house, claiming she had found her sisters' corpses inside a secret room and was attacked by something in the shape of a woman with a yellow face. Afterwards, Elizabeth left for California and never returned. The manor has lain deserted since, and the local black folk shun it. The eponymous pigeons sometimes flock about the decaying manor. Legend has it that they are the souls of past Blassenvilles' members.
The following evening, Buckner and Griswell visit the hut of an ancient voodoo practitioner, Jacob, seeking information about the house and the Blassenvilles. Jacob tells of the extinct family and of Celia Blassenville, who mistreated her maid Joan. He claims to be a creator of ""zuvembies"", although he insists he cannot talk about them to a white man without Damballah sending a snake with a white crescent moon on its head to kill him. Still, he drifts into senility before rambling about voodoo, the god Damballah, and  zombies along with their female counterparts, zuvembies: who live only to kill, have no sense of time, possess hypnotic powers, and can live indefinitely unless wounded by either ""steel or lead"". Finally, he tells how ""she"" participated in voodoo rites and that ""the other"" came to Jacob for the ""Black Brew"", which transforms a woman into a zuvembie. Reaching for some firewood, Jacob is bitten by a venomous snake, meeting the fate he feared. Buckner and Griswell conclude that Joan transformed herself into a zuvembie, so she could exact her vengeance on Celia Blassenville and her nieces. They resolve on spending the night in Blassenville Manor to learn the truth. There, they find Elizabeth Blassenville's diary, which tells of her fear that something is in the house with her, has killed her sisters, and will kill her too.
That night, while lying awake in complete darkness, Griswell hears the same whistling as the previous night, which Elizabeth's diary had also mentioned. Thinking he is fleeing the house, Griswell finds himself climbing the manor stairs against his own will. He is confronted by a female apparition with a yellow face and welding a knife. Griswell is powerless to resist, but Bruckner, who has followed him up the stairs, shoots the creature, which flees, mortally wounded. They track its dying noises into the secret room, where they discover the hanging bodies of the three missing Blassenville sisters as well as the corpse of the zuvembie, which is still dressed in a ball gown.
Suddenly, Bruckner recognizes the face of the zuvembie from a portrait he has seen. It's none other than Celia Blassenville. The maid Joan, in revenge, gave the Black Brew she received from Jacob to her mistress and fled. Celia Blassenville, transformed into a zuvembie, killed three of her nieces and had been living in the abandoned manor, killing anyone who entered it at night.
Bruckner says that the case can be closed by saying that a madwoman had killed Griswell's friend John Branner, since nobody will believe the truth of the matter.
The original single illustration was by Virgil Finlay;[5] unusually, Weird Tales reprinted the story in November, 1951, with a different illustrator, Lee Brown Coye.[6] Later illustrators for its interior and cover art include Boris Vallejo, Jeffrey Catherine Jones, Esteban Maroto, and Scott Hampton.
In 2018, a news item from the Bleeding Cool website reported that Howard's estate had applied to register a trademark for comic book versions of ""Pigeons From Hell."" Rich Johnston explained that there had been debate over the filing of the copyright; but ""trademark is different to copyright, and while it may be argued the content of the story is public domain, the trademark for the title and selling under that name, would be different. And it is that, that Robert E. Howard Properties is applying for a trademark for, but only for comic books. Dark Horse Comics published an adaptation under license from the estate, and now Marvel Comics has the Conan licence. I wonder if there's a spinoff being planned?""[2]
""Pigeons from Hell"" is one of several regional horror stories by Howard set in the Piney Woods of the ArkLaTex region of the Deep South. Other stories include ""The Shadow of the Beast"", ""Moon of Zimbabwe"", ""Black Hound of Death"", and ""Black Canaan"".
In 1983, Stephen King, writing in Danse Macabre, calls ""Pigeons from Hell"" to be ""one of the finest horror stories of our century"". Horror historian R. S. Hadji includes ""Pigeons from Hell"" on his list of the most frightening horror stories.[7]
The story is the basis for an eponymous episode of Boris Karloff's Thriller television series, airing in June 1961.[8] It was directed by John Newland, with a teleplay by John Kneubuhl, and starred Brandon De Wilde, Crahan Denton, Ken Renard, and Ottola Nesmith as the Blassenville Zuvembie. It was adapted again in televised form for Suspense, a revival of the 1940s-1950s television anthology series, in an episode that aired January 30, 2015.[9]
In 1988, the story was adapted into a graphic novel by Scott Hampton for Eclipse (ISBN 0913035688), as a stand-alone paperback, with a limited edition hardcover. Horror novelist Ramsey Campbell wrote the introduction to this version. Ryan Harvey wrote for Black Gate: Adventures in Fantasy Literature, ""Hampton's trip to visit Howard's southern horrors is one of the most faithful, if not the most faithful, adaptations of [Howard] in any medium. It has the same brisk and breathless pacing, the same 1930s Gothic southern atmosphere, and the same level of palsied fear. Hampton's artwork is a seamless meld with Howard's style: robust and realistic, shot through with shadows. The graphic novel has little in common in its look and 'silent' style with most contemporary comic works — either from the 1980s or now — and leaps right off the page because of it. Howard fans who haven't read it should see if they can dig up a full-color copy.""[10]
The story was re-envisioned and modernized by comedy horror author Joe R. Lansdale, with art by Nathan Fox, as a four-issue comic book mini-series and published in four issues by Dark Horse Comics, starting in April 2008.[11] In early 2009, Dark Horse re-released it in trade paperback form, with an afterword by fantasy author Mark Finn and bonus artwork pages from guest illustrators.[10] Ryan Harvey describes the re-write at length, discussing how Lansdale ""replaces the two New England strangers who stop at the Blassenville Manor while on a road trip with a new group of characters who come across as [a] Goth rock version of the Scooby Doo gang."" Harvey calls it a fun adaptation which, however, ""proves that all the expansion and updating in the world can't fix what wasn't broken [...] The Lansdale/Fox Pigeons from Hell is a swampy and gory good time, feeling much closer to a modern 'backwoods brutality' horror flick than Howard's grim campfire folk story"" with ""the finale as a standard 'Let's go back and get that thing' action-centered conclusion. [...] Fox's artwork (his first solo comics gig) is ugly in the positive sense: everything is bent, twisted, and unclean.""[10]
Another graphic edition appeared in 2008 as a 60-page comic in the omnibus The Mammoth Book of Zombie Comics, with text appearing only in speech balloons, to mixed reviews.[12]
The Pretenders' song ""Back on the Chain Gang"" references this story in the lyric ""... the news of the world / Got in the house like a pigeon from Hell.""
