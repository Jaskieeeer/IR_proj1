       "['\\nBaldur\\'s Gate 3 (also known as BG3 and Baldur\\'s Gate III) is a 2023 role-playing video game by Larian Studios. It is the third installment in the Baldur\\'s Gate series. The game\\'s full release for Windows happened in August, with PlayStation 5, macOS, and Xbox Series X/S later in the same year. In the game\\'s narrative, the party seeks to cure themselves of a parasitic tadpole infecting their brain. It can be played alone or in a group.\\nAdapted from the fifth edition of tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, Baldur\\'s Gate 3 takes its mechanics and setting, the Forgotten Realms, from the tabletop game. Players create a highly customisable character and embark on quests with a party of voiced companions. Alternatively, they can play as a companion instead. The gameplay comprises real-time exploration of large areas, turn-based combat, and narrative choices which impact the party and the wider world. Outcomes for combat, dialogue and world interaction are generally determined by rolling a 20-sided die.\\nBaldur\\'s Gate (1998) and Baldur\\'s Gate II: Shadows of Amn (2000) were developed by BioWare. A third game, subtitled The Black Hound and developed by Black Isle, was cancelled in 2003 following a licensing dispute. Dungeons and Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast (WotC) declined Larian\\'s first pitch to make the game following the release of Divinity: Original Sin (2014). Impressed by pre-release material for Divinity: Original Sin II (2017), WotC welcomed a new pitch and eventually greenlit Larian\\'s development. The company grew considerably in the six-year production. In August 2020, Larian released the game\\'s first act in early access, providing them with player feedback and revenue. After the full release, Larian added free new content to the game until the final patch in April 2025.\\nBaldur\\'s Gate 3 received critical acclaim and had record-breaking awards success, with praise directed at its cinematic visuals, writing, production quality, and performances. It became the first title to win Game of the Year at all five major video game awards ceremonies and received the same accolade from several publications. It was financially successful, generating significant profit for both Larian Studios and WotC\\'s parent company Hasbro.  It has been regarded as one of the greatest video games ever made.\\nBaldur\\'s Gate 3 is a role-playing game,[6] and can be played in single-player or multiplayer.[b] It has a free-floating camera, with players able to adjust the perspective from top-down isometric to third person.[9] Based on the fifth edition rules of the tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D 5e),[6] several mechanics are identical between the two.[10][c] A major feature is that outcomes are decided by rolling a twenty-sided die (d20).[12][d] Some rolls occur with \"advantage\" or \"disadvantage\", meaning two d20s are rolled and the player receives the best or worst result, respectively.[14] The game includes support for modding, but using them disables achievements.[15]\\nIn character creation, the player selects a class,[e] species,[f] and backstory.[g][21] If the selected class uses magic, they will also choose their starting spells.[17] Characters level up by collecting experience points by several means—examples include exploration, combat, and solving puzzles. Levelling up provides access to new class features.[22] The maximum player level of Baldur\\'s Gate 3 is level 12; in the tabletop game, the limit is level 20.[23][11] Available at certain level intervals are feats.[24] These diversify or specialise a character\\'s style of play.[25] With each feat, players choose a new ability or increase their stats,[24] which are called abilities.[h][26] After levelling up, players can also choose to place a level into a different class, known as multiclassing.[i]\\nThe game is divided into three acts,[27] with a large, explorable location tied to each.[28] In non-combat scenarios, the game is primarily experienced in real time.[26][j] There are 288 quests,[30]:\\u200a1:23\\u200a with significant creative freedom as to how they are completed,[27] some being mutually exclusive, and some unfolding across multiple arcs.[31] Companions have their own side quests, but the game can be completed without companion presence.[32] Almost any character can die,[33] including those integral to the narrative,[27] and all speaking characters are fully voiced.[34] Using a spell or potion, players can speak to any encountered animal,[35] and a more limited number of corpses.[36]\\nPlayers can set up a camp as a way to rest from the adventure and talk with companions.[37] There are 17 unique camp locations, contextually dependent on where in the game world the camp is set up.[38] A non-player character based at camp, Withers, allows players to respec.[39] Limited resources—for example, hit points and spell slots—are replenished by resting. There are two types of rest: long and short. A short rest restores 50% of the characters\\' maximum hit points alongside some class-specific features. Players can short rest twice before they must long rest to replenish them. Long rests teleport players back to camp and fully replenish resources.[39]\\nPlayers select items in the world, such as chests, to interact with them.[26] Items, like explosive barrels, can be sent to a camp stash and retrieved later.[40] Picking locks, disarming traps, and exploring locations grant experience.[22] If the player attempts to pick a lock, the game rolls a dice; the result is compared against the value required to open the lock. A character\\'s skills or abilities can add to the rolled value, making it easier.[12]\\nThe game\\'s combat systems are modelled on D&D 5e.[26] Entering combat switches the game to turn-based mode.[26] A d20 roll, called an initiative roll, determines the order in which each character acts.[k] In a turn, each character has limited resources.[42] The primary resources are actions, bonus actions, and movement.[42] Major instructions to a character, like attacking with a sword or casting a spell, consume an action. Smaller commands, like jumping or drinking a potion,[l] consume a bonus action.[44] Characters can also move a set distance. When the player has finished the available actions for a character, their turn ends; combat is finished when all enemies are defeated.[42] The player can also have controlled characters leave combat by moving sufficiently far from enemies. The outcomes of player actions—for example, whether an attack hits and how much damage it deals—are primarily determined through dice rolls.[42][44]\\nWhen a character attacks, the game rolls a d20—this is called an attack roll.[42] The result is compared against the target\\'s armour class; if the roll value is lower than the armour class, the attack misses.[45] Players can see the percentage-chance that an attack will hit before making it; this value is impacted by things like terrain.[42] Some attacks have damage types. These can amplify one another (e.g., applying grease and fire to a target will make them burn for multiple turns) or counteract the other\\'s effect (e.g., shooting a fire arrow at an enemy standing in ice will melt the ice, leaving a water surface).[46] Environmental elements like explosive barrels can be exploited,[42] and weapons can be dipped in poison.[46]\\nConversations are another area of gameplay in Baldur\\'s Gate 3. Some conversations include skill checks, wherein the player rolls a d20, with the result affecting the outcome. Players can initiate combat by selecting an aggressive dialogue option,[47] or use dialogue to avoid combat entirely.[48] This is a major feature of the charisma-focused bard class.[47] Dialogue options can involve persuasion, intimidation, and deception.[49]\\nPlayer characters can initiate romance or sexual relationships with many non-player characters.[50] Actions and dialogue options affect relationship outcomes.[51] Characters that can be romanced are \"playersexual\", meaning the player character\\'s gender does not impact romance availability.[52][50] The game has thirteen romance options.[51]\\nBaldur\\'s Gate 3 shares its Dungeons and Dragons setting, called the Forgotten Realms, with previous games in the franchise. BG3 and its predecessors take place on the continent of Faerûn, primarily near or inside the namesake city of Baldur\\'s Gate. BG3 occurs over 100 years after the events of Baldur\\'s Gate II: Shadows of Amn (2000) and shortly after the events of the D&D tie-in adventure, Baldur\\'s Gate: Descent into Avernus (2019).[53] The game features monsters from the Forgotten Realms, including owlbears,[54] gnolls,[55] and mind flayers.[27]\\nThe game\\'s first act has no designated tutorial, but certain resources and encounters throughout the act are deliberately constructed to guide the player.[56] The act is primarily set around a mind flayer ship wreckage.[57] Players have access to several locations, including a druids\\' grove, goblin camp, and a monastery set against a mountain pass.[28] Writer Ali Jones characterises the first act as \"fairytale backdrop\", and IGN\\'s Leana Hafer said it was \"mostly idyllic wilderness\".[58] Eight of the game\\'s ten companions are introduced in act one, with six recruitable near the start.[59] The Underdark is a large subterranean area accessible through multiple locations; each entrance leads to unique environments.[57] Act one ends when players traverse the mountain pass or Underdark to reach act two\\'s setting.[60] In act two, players traverse the Shadow Cursed lands to reach Moonrise Towers,[28] an oppressive and dark environment.[58][61][62] Only one companion is introduced in act two.[59] Locations explored include the Last Light Inn[58] and the Gauntlet of Shar.[63] The third and final act is primarily set in the dense city environment of Baldur\\'s Gate,[28] but with some areas accessible outside of the city, like a visiting circus and the shoreline.[64] The city is the location of the tenth and final recruitable companion.[59]\\nThe world, alongside the player\\'s thoughts and observations, are recounted by the game\\'s narrator (Amelia Tyler), acting as BG3\\'s dungeon master. While the narrator was originally planned to deliver lines contemptuously, Larian was impressed by Tyler\\'s deadpan delivery.[65] Of the ten companions, six can be chosen as the player character in the character creator. Known as origin characters, they have a pre-set character class, race, and appearance. Although their classes can be changed, origin character personalities and backstories are sometimes related to them.[66]\\nThe seventh origin character, the Dark Urge, cannot be recruited.[n] The Dark Urge narrative is linked closely with the main narrative. In this origin, the player is compulsively evil and can choose to resist or indulge these desires.[84]\\nThere are four non-origin characters who can be recruited:\\nThe game\\'s overarching villain is the Absolute, voiced by prolific voice actress Cissy Jones, who controls the mind flayers.[90] Three other antagonists control the elder brain—Ketheric Thorm, Enver Gortash, and Orin the Red.[91] Actor J. K. Simmons portrays Ketheric Thorm,[92] a tragic villain planned as recruitable in early development.[93] Jason Isaacs and Maggie Robertson portray Enver Gortash and Orin the Red, respectively.[94][95] The Emperor is a mind flayer detached from the species\\' hive mind. A controversial, complex character,[96] and a player romance option, he was voiced by Scott Joseph.[97] Raphael, a devil, is a supporting villain encountered early who offers the player a deal to remove the parasite in their head.[98][99] Voice actor Andrew Wincott portrays Raphael as a theatrical villain influenced by Shakespeare\\'s Iago.[100]\\nThe protagonist wakes up inside a giant dimension-crossing illithid (mind flayer) flying ship. They are infected with a parasitic tadpole that enthralls and transforms people into illithids; however, the transformation does not happen, and the ship comes under attack from githyanki warriors riding red dragons. The mind flayer crew teleports the ship to the Nine Hells and are attacked by an army of Devils. The protagonist is freed during the fighting and steers the damaged ship to Faerûn, where it crashes. They encounter other survivors of the wreck, all likewise implanted with tadpoles.\\nThe party seeks to remove their parasites through numerous avenues, all of which fail to provide a cure. They are saved from the tadpoles\\' overwhelming psychic force by a \"Dream Visitor\" inside Shadowheart\\'s mysterious prism, a device that is sought after by the githyanki. The protagonist then becomes involved in the fate of the Emerald Grove, where local druids and tiefling refugees face off against the goblin horde that worships a cult of the \"Absolute\". Once the party either sacks or saves the grove, they travel through the mountains or the Underdark to reach Moonrise Towers, a cultist stronghold, in search of a new cure.\\nThe protagonist seeks sanctuary from the curse around Moonrise Towers in a tavern called the Last Light, held by a group of tiefling refugees, Flaming Fist conscripts, and Harpers. General Ketheric Thorm, the reigning lord of Moonrise and Chosen of Myrkul, is using a relic named the \"Nightsong\" as an engine for his immortality. The party scours the Gauntlet of Shar, a deserted temple to the goddess of darkness and loss, in pursuit of the Nightsong, revealed to be Dame Aylin, a daughter of Selûne, the goddess of the moon and Shar\\'s sister. After either slaying or freeing the Nightsong, the protagonist confronts Ketheric, as well as his cohorts—Orin the Red (the Chosen of Bhaal) and Enver Gortash (the Chosen of Bane). Through their Netherstones and a mysterious crown, the triumvirate collectively controls the Absolute (revealed to be an Elder Brain, the ultimate form of the illithid race) and seeks to rule the Sword Coast by manipulating everyone infected with a tadpole. Orin and Gortash depart with the Elder Brain for Baldur\\'s Gate, while the protagonist defeats Ketheric and claims his Netherstone.\\nThe protagonist arrives at Baldur\\'s Gate as Gortash and Orin attempt to pit them against the other, while the companions find closure for their personal quests. It is revealed that the \"Dream Visitor\" is, in fact, a visage taken by a renegade illithid called the Emperor, who resides within the prism and oversees the imprisonment of a powerful githyanki, Orpheus. Orpheus is the source of psionic resistance the party possesses against the Absolute, and the Emperor has been leveraging this in his favour. The protagonist eventually faces off against Gortash and Orin, assembling the Netherstones to subdue the Elder Brain. The Elder Brain, having anticipated the triumvirate and the protagonist\\'s every move, overpowers the party before the Emperor comes to the rescue.\\nRealizing that the Netherstones require an illithid wielder with Orpheus\\' powers to be effective, the protagonist either frees Orpheus and allows him to transform, which causes the Emperor to resign to his fate and join the Absolute, or has either the Emperor, a transformed Karlach, or the player character consume Orpheus in order to see the mission through. After defeating the Elder Brain, the protagonist can choose to either kill it and every illithid tadpole with it, ending the threat forever, or betray their comrades and rule as the Absolute.\\nThe Baldur\\'s Gate series began development in 1995 when Wizards of the Coast\\'s predecessor, TSR, Inc., asked publisher Interplay Entertainment to produce a video game using the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) property. BioWare agreed to develop the title, having formed a partnership with Interplay for Shattered Steel (1996). Initially titled Iron Throne, the game was retitled Baldur\\'s Gate (1998) at the suggestion of Interplay co-founder Brian Fargo.[101] Created by a largely inexperienced group of developers,[102]:\\u200a1\\u200a BioWare delivered the game a year behind Interplay\\'s schedule and achieved commercial success, leading to an expansion in 1999.[101][o] A direct sequel followed, Baldur\\'s Gate II: Shadows of Amn (2000), using the second edition of D&D for its rule set,[103] and was also published by Interplay and Black Isle Studios.[102]:\\u200a3\\u200a The first two Baldur\\'s Gate games provided pre-scripted, branching narratives. BioWare\\'s third game with the D&D property, Neverwinter Nights (2002), used D&D\\'s third edition,[103] and facilitated a gameplay experience closer to the tabletop game by emphasising multiplayer and allowing players to control non-player characters.[105][p] Following a licensing issue, another Dungeons and Dragons video game, The Black Hound, was designated as the third game in the Baldur\\'s Gate series; it was cancelled when Interplay lost the rights to release Baldur\\'s Gate titles on PC.[104]\\nSeveral companies sought the rights to make the title over the following decade. Interplay\\'s Brian Fargo described interest from Obsidian Entertainment\\'s CEO Feargus Urquhart, Larian Studios\\' CEO Swen Vincke, and Fargo himself.[107] Canadian developer Beamdog made enhanced editions of the first and second games, followed by Baldur\\'s Gate: Siege of Dragonspear (2016), a large expansion using the Infinity Engine.[108] Cameron Tofer, co-founder of Beamdog, said making the third game was the studio\\'s \"long-term goal\".[109]\\nVincke first approached Wizards of the Coast (WotC) about making the game during Larian\\'s development of Divinity: Original Sin (2014), but WotC declined, citing their inexperience.[q] Shortly before the release of the sequel, Divinity: Original Sin II (2017), WotC were intrigued by pre-release footage and asked Larian for a pitch for Baldur\\'s Gate 3. Vincke created a design document around a month before the release of Original Sin II in a hotel room with several designers and writers.[111] The pitch was scheduled for the release day of Original Sin II, leading to a short turnaround time. WotC did not like the pitch, but granted Larian\\'s request for more time.[112][79] WotC had a new chief executive officer at this time and Vincke met him on one of his first days. Larian had to meet several milestones, including an approved design document.[113]:\\u200a5:52\\u200a A later pitch was received positively and WotC granted Larian the licence.[79][111] In an October 2019 Twitter post, Fargo said he knew who was developing Baldur\\'s Gate 3.[114]\\nLarian wanted to produce a game with triple-A production values, budget, and marketing;  they viewed Baldur\\'s Gate, alongside Fallout and Ultima, as an intellectual property capable of enabling that.[115] Larian built new cinematic functionality into their game engine, viewing these capabilities as key to accessibility. The studio\\'s cinematic ambitions came with challenges,[6] requiring the studio grow considerably.[116] Close-up dialogue scenes required new teams responsible for cinematics quality assurance and lighting. The size of the art and audio teams increased because the technical requirements differed from those of Original Sin II. Clothing designs and textures, for example, had to work from close and far perspectives because of the cinematic camera.[116][117] Baldur\\'s Gate 3 uses technology from the eighth generation of video game consoles, like screen-spaced reflections and shadow maps for lighting and shadow.[118]\\nThe studio\\'s size increased from around 140 employees in 2017 to over 450 in 2023, making it one of the world\\'s largest privately owned video game companies.[116] Industry journalist Jason Schreier described Larian Studios as a \"unicorn\": large enough to make triple-A games but not subject to the mechanics mandated by publicly traded publishers, like microtransactions and battle passes, that \"maximize revenue\" and \"minimize risk\".[119]\\nIn part due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Baldur\\'s Gate 3 had an unusually long 6-year development cycle.[116] Larian closed its Saint Petersburg office following the invasion. Anticipating military enlistment for staff, they liaised with embassies and consulates to support relocation efforts, with 90% of employees based in Saint Petersburg moving office. The game\\'s complex code base meant the effects of closing the office were felt throughout development.[120]\\nVincke described Baldur\\'s Gate 3 as Larian\\'s \"Covid game\",[121] with the pandemic reducing productivity, causing communication issues internally and with external partners, and preventing performance motion capture.[122] The studio lost staff over the 6-year development period,[121] including cinematics lead Jim Southworth, who died shortly after the game\\'s release.[123] The credits bear a dedication to Southworth.[2]\\nDungeons and Dragons creative director Mike Mearls said the team welcomed Larian changes to D&D lore, hoping changes would tie into increased player agency.[124] Mearls said that collaborating with Larian felt like a natural extension of Wizards of the Coast\\'s D&D team, with both companies anticipating required adjustments to fifth-edition rules.[125] Vincke suggested using mind flayers as antagonists after seeing an illustration in Volo\\'s Guide to Monsters.[6] Writer Adam Smith said WotC had not documented the process of transforming into one, so Larian produced a 7-day timeline,[3] inspired by body horror and the films of David Cronenberg.[126] Baldur\\'s Gate 3 is set over 100 years after the first two entries; Smith said WotC had \"filled out\" the intervening century because the area was integral to the Forgotten Realms and Sword Coast settings.[127] Larian collaborated with WotC on a precursor module for the game,[127] Baldur\\'s Gate: Descent into Avernus (2019). The module provided information on events occurring since Baldur\\'s Gate II.[124]\\nLarian had two London-based studios working on motion capture. Vincke estimated this spanned 1.5 million words of dialogue in 2020;[6] in 2024, Vincke estimated 1.3 million lines and over 140 hours of cutscenes.[128][r] In development, the multiplayer mode allowed players to role play with their partner, but the feature was removed because of the added complexity.[130] All 248 of the game\\'s voice actors performed the motion capture for their characters.[131] There are over 170 ending variations,[116][s] which required substantial testing,[4]:\\u200a16:27\\u200a and Larian\\'s writers worked on ending dialogue and descriptions for over a year.[76] Larian encouraged the main cast to interact with fans, which Devora Wilde, who portrays Lae\\'zel, said was unusual in the industry.[79]\\nSmith described the team\\'s approach as \"reactive\", saying that identifying frequent player choices informed their writing decisions.[127] Some characters were changed substantially throughout development. Larian reduced the hostility of companions to the player character, including Shadowheart and Lae\\'zel.[76] Karlach\\'s infernal heart was a late addition to the game.[76] According to region producer Elena Statsenko, Larian aimed to incorporate moral dilemmas and outcome variety for different player types into quests.[30]:\\u200a1:23\\u200a Other design considerations included integration with the main story and adjustments if the player controlled an origin character.[30]:\\u200a5:29\\u200a\\nLarian Studios revealed Baldur\\'s Gate 3 with a trailer at a conference for Google\\'s cloud gaming platform, Stadia, in July 2019.[112] Vincke said letting potential customers play without installing the game had \"great conversion power\", but stated the title would not be exclusive to Stadia.[133] Following Google\\'s discontinuation of Stadia in 2023, Vincke expressed regret, describing it as \"a really stupid deal\", but said the funds provided by the deal had funded the game\\'s visuals.[134]\\nLarian partially released an unfinished version of the game\\'s first act into early access in October 2020. The early access had over 2.5 million players[116] with the resulting revenue sustaining the studio.[135] The game\\'s scope increased throughout this period.[116] Some companions were not recruitable in the early access,[76] and it contained many bugs.[79] Other changes included new character classes and subclasses, user interface updates and game balancing.[136][137] Eurogamer\\'s Ruth Cassidy said that the changes to characterisation before the full release, such as decreasing hostility to the player and increasing their vulnerability, felt like fan service.[138] Continuous rewriting of the script required voice actors to return to the studio.[79]\\nDuring early access the game\\'s Steam user reviews dropped below 75%, which Vincke characterised as a \"disaster\".[139] IGN, PC Gamer and GameSpot\\'s reviewers said it was fun but that bugs meant waiting for the full release would be advantageous,[140][141][142] with David Wildgoose describing the game as \"rough\", \"messy\", and \"just barely hanging together\".[142] Ars Technica and Siliconera\\'s reviews said the early access provided an overall disappointing experience.[143][144]\\nLarian experienced issues while developing a version for Xbox Series X and Series S.[145] Performance variation between the two consoles in split-screen co-operative play was an issue because feature parity was a requirement of the Xbox platform.[146]  Following an in-person meeting with Microsoft Games executive Phil Spencer at Gamescom, Vincke and Spencer arranged a compromise where the game could be brought to Xbox consoles without split-screen play on the Xbox Series S.[147]\\nIn March 2023, Larian Studios staff were concerned that the game would be delayed to avoid competition from another title, Bethesda Softworks\\' Starfield, after the lengthy development cycle. Vincke accelerated the game\\'s Windows release by four weeks,[116] and delayed the PlayStation 5 version by one week.[148] The game was released for Windows on 3 August 2023,[54] PlayStation 5 on 6 September 2023,[149] and macOS on 22 September 2023.[150] Following the PlayStation 5 version\\'s launch, Larian revealed an animated short, \"The Launch Party\", co-produced with UK-based animation studio Mashed.[151] On 7 December 2023, directly following The Game Awards 2023, Larian released Baldur\\'s Gate 3 on Xbox Series X and Series S.[152]\\nAfter release, Larian Studios provided new content and improvements via patching, with release dates sometimes varying by platform.[153] Released for PC in August 2023, the first patch added over 1,000 bug fixes and balance changes, alongside increased polish for animations.[154] The September 2023 update permitted players to customise their appearance,[155] support for modding, and increased the number of endings for evil playthroughs.[156] A November 2023 patch added customisation for player characters and hirelings; increased the frequency of autosaving; and new idle animations.[157] In December 2023, the developer added two difficulty modes and an expanded epilogue featuring over 3,500 new lines of dialogue.[158] An eighth and final patch was released in April 2025. The patch introduced 12 new sub-classes, a photo mode, cross-platform play,[159] and co-operative split-screen for Xbox Series S.[160] Jasmine Gould-Wilson regretted that GamesRadar+ could not name BG3 as their 2024 game of the year despite extensive changes to the changes.[161]\\nThe developer was widely criticised for not providing full credits for localisation teams involved in the game. Vincke blamed the error on Larian\\'s localisation provider, Altagram, and promised a fix.[162] Altagram published an apology.[163]\\nLarian released a physical edition of the game but the disc did not contain the full game, instead providing a downloader for it. The game\\'s full soundtrack was distributed across three discs, and it featured a cloth-printed map, stickers, and a chalk-paper mind flayer poster.[164]\\nAccording to review aggregator website Metacritic, Baldur\\'s Gate 3 received \"universal acclaim\" from critics,[165][166][167] with 98% of critics recommending the game on aggregator OpenCritic.[168] Critics praised the game\\'s detail and scope, with several comparing the studio to a gracious dungeon master,[21][27][176][54][17][174] and describing the game as faithfully emulating the tabletop Dungeons and Dragons experience.[151][54][118] The Guardian\\'s Nick Rueben said the game enabled players to solve problems creatively.[21] Several reviews praised the game\\'s production quality, citing the cinematics, performance capture, and fully voiced cast.[54][169][33] Polygon\\'s Gita Jackson described the game as a \"masterpiece\" with limits imposed by a flawed tabletop predecessor.[173]\\nThe writing received wide praise.[54][169][27] IGN\\'s Leana Hafer said the side quests were \"strong\",[54] with Allen Van Aken praising quest outcome variety;[169] Dekker said the game rightly prioritised player freedom over satisfying quest resolution.[27] Eurogamer\\'s Ruth Cassidy criticised the main narrative as having false urgency.[138] Windows Central\\'s Jennifer Young said narrative decisions had weight because almost every character could die.[33] PCMag\\'s reviewers criticised that some choices could inadvertently prevent players accessing some plot lines.[17] The Dark Urge character origin received dedicated coverage.[177][178][179]\\nSeveral reviews praised the characters as elevating the narrative above standard fantasy tropes and archetypes.[169][27] Andrew Zucosky, the reviewer for Digital Trends, said the companions\\' stories were his main motivation for playing.[34] Ali Jones said companion\\'s personalities contrasted well with their character classes—for example, Shadowheart as a healer \"[serving] a goddess of darkness and loss\" and Karlach as a traumatised barbarian \"determined to draw on joy\".[180] Jackson praised the companion\\'s reactivity, highlighting the vampire spawn Astarion\\'s embrace of his freedom.[173] Eurogamer\\'s Ruth Cassidy criticised the rushed initiation of romance arcs,[138] while PCMag\\'s reviewers praised them for developing naturally and being \"unabashedly sexual\".[17] Hafer and Jones praised the romance overall,[54] with Jones describing the approach as more \"mature\" than \"picking the right dialogue options\".[180] A month after launch, Vincke explained that a bug had made companions \"so horny\".[181]\\nSome reviewers praised BG3\\'s combat, citing the range of options,[171][62][172][138] reactivity,[27][182][17] and approaches enabling combat avoidance.[172][33][171] Eric Van Allen of Destructoid said combat \"ranges from interesting to overwhelming\".[182] Cassidy praised the game for encouraging positional strategy and preparation.[138] Two critics suggested that the game\\'s complexity would be divisive.[183][174] Some reviewers described combat as tedious.[173][33] Polygon\\'s Maddy Myers criticised some elements as unintuitive, citing how weapons are dipped in poison by interacting with them as if they are a health potion instead of the \"dip weapon\" function.[46] Jackson said she saved before every combat encounter because random outcomes often had devastating, uncontrollable consequences.[173] Young said combat would be \"daunting\" to D&D newcomers.[33]\\nThere were complaints about bugs and diminishing polish in later portions of the game. The original review by Digital Foundry\\'s Alex Battaglia said the PC version\\'s technical polish was impressive.[118] Following suggestions by players to review the end of the game, Battaglia noted substantial performance drops in the third act caused by the city\\'s density.[184] Rebekah Valentine said the game\\'s size concealed issues with the final act, describing it as less polished than the preceding two;[185] several other reviewers highlighted bugs.[54][27]  Writing for Digital Spy, Jess Lee said \"cracks began to show\" in act three, citing two companions reacting with relationship-ending anger to a decision and forgetting shortly thereafter.[186] According to IGN, bug complaints persisted months beyond release;[79][t] the game\\'s first major patch fixed over 1000 bugs.[188] PC Gamer\\'s Fraser Brown, meanwhile, expressed surprise at how few bugs surfaced on his playthrough given BG3\\'s scope and complexity.[62]\\nPrior to the game\\'s full release, Jason Schreier wrote that its success was likely, citing positive reception to the early access, strong pre-order sales, and high interest in the Dungeons and Dragons property.[116] The game sold 2.5 million copies during the early access period.[116]\\nIt became one of 2023\\'s largest launches after release.[189] In February 2024, Larian\\'s publishing director Michael Douse said the game had over 10 million players.[u][191] As of 2023[update], Larian has not released precise sales figures.[123] The Irish Independent reported in November 2024 that Larian\\'s 2023 pre-tax profit reached €249 million, a twentyfold from the previous year,[v] and that the game had thus far sold 15 million copies.[193]\\nVincke described the game\\'s performance as \"way beyond\" expectations; he had been concerned the game\\'s entire audience had purchased it during early access.[194] In a Q4 2023 earnings call, Wizards of the Coast\\'s parent company Hasbro said the game had earned the company $90 million.[195] Douse said the game\\'s player count increased 20% over 2024, with IGN\\'s Wesley Yin-Poole attributing this to modding support.[196]\\nBaldur\\'s Gate 3 had record-breaking award success continuing over a year beyond its release. According to Vincke, Larian sent rotating groups of staff to award ceremonies because it started to impact the studio\\'s development activities.[197] In April 2024, the game became the first to win Game of the Year, or the equivalent category, at all five major ceremonies: the Golden Joystick Awards, the Game Developers Choice Awards, the DICE Awards, the BAFTAs, and The Game Awards.[198] Several publications also selected Baldur\\'s Gate 3 as the best title of the year, including Ars Technica,[199] GameSpot,[200] GamesRadar+,[201] and PC Gamer.[202] It won the 2024 Hugo Award for Best Game or Interactive Work.[203]\\nAt the Golden Joystick Awards, the game broke the previous record with seven wins, including Best Storytelling, Best Visual Design, and Studio of the Year for Larian.[204]  At The Game Awards, the game won in six of the nine nominated categories, including Best Role Playing Game, Best Community Support, and Best Multiplayer Game.[205] Baldur\\'s Gate 3 was one of two titles to win multiple awards at the 27th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards,[w] receiving Role-Playing Game of the Year alongside Outstanding Achievements in Story, Game Design, and Game Direction.[206] At the BAFTA Game Awards, the title won five awards; lead writer Sarah Baylus and composer Borislav Slavov accepted the awards for Best Narrative and Best Music, respectively.[207] At the 24th Game Developers Choice Awards in San Francisco, it received four awards, including Best Narrative and Best Design.[208] It led The Steam Awards in 2023 with two wins, including Game of the Year and Outstanding Story-Rich Game.[209]\\nThe game\\'s performances received awards recognition. Neil Newbon (Astarion) won Best Supporting Performer at the Golden Joysticks and Best Performance at The Game Awards.[204][205] Newbon shared nominated with the game\\'s narrator, Amelia Tyler, at several ceremonies, including the New York Game Awards and the Golden Joysticks.[210] Newbon\\'s performance was also nominated at the DICE Awards alongside Samantha Béart (Karlach).[206] At the BAFTAs, Newbon, Béart and Tyler were nominated for Performer in a Leading Role. There were three nominations for the Performer in a Supporting Role award: Tracy Wiles (Jaheira), Dave Jones (Halsin) and Andrew Wincott (Raphael),[211] with Wincott\\'s performance winning.[207] Several awards were for BG3\\'s LGBTQ representation. It won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Video Game.[212] At the 2024 Gayming Awards, it received four nominations, including two for Best LGBTQ Character, winning with Shadowheart, and the Game of the Year.[213]\\nThe game\\'s score, and composer Borislav Slavov, received several nominations. In 2020 and 2021, he received Hollywood Music in Media Awards nominations for Original Song – Video Games (\"Weeping Dawn\" and \"I Want to Live\", respectively),[214][215] and for the full score in 2023.[216] Slavov was nominated for Best Score and Music at The Game Awards.[205] Slavov won in the Music category at the BAFTAs.[207]\\nFollowing release, Larian reiterated interest in updating the game via patches but would not commit to downloadable content (DLC).[217] While delivering a March 2024 talk at Game Developers Conference, Vincke announced the studio would not develop a sequel or downloadable content.[218] While Larian started to work on DLC because of fan demand, there was no passion for the idea internally.[219] Larian subsequently said it was working on two projects,[220] using their own intellectual property for both and targeting a pre-2030 release for the first.[221]\\nAs of 2025[update], there were several Dungeons & Dragons video games in production,[222] including one by Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance developer Invoke Studios,[223][224] a life simulation RPG by French developer Gameloft,[225][226] and an action-adventure game by Stig Asmussen\\'s studio Giant Skull.[227][228] Another D&D project, a live service game by Swedish developer Starbreeze Studios, was cancelled in October 2025.[229][230] Hasbro\\'s digital games vice-president Dan Ayoub said in March 2025 that discussions were ongoing over the future of Baldur\\'s Gate and hoped to announce plans in the near future.[231]\\nList of Dungeons & Dragons video games\\n',\n",
       " '\\nBaldur\\'s Gate III: The Black Hound was a cancelled role-playing video game developed by Black Isle Studios and to be published by Interplay Entertainment for the Microsoft Windows platform. Announced in 2002 under the codenames FR6 and Project Jefferson, it was planned to be the third main entry in the Baldur\\'s Gate series, utilizing the Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition ruleset. The game was set to use a 3D graphics engine developed for the game, rather than the Infinity Engine used for the developer\\'s previous games.[1]\\nThe Black Hound was cancelled in 2003 when Interplay lost the rights to develop further Dungeons & Dragons games for the PC platform.[2] Development at Black Isle Studios moved onto a sequel to the Fallout series codenamed Van Buren, which was itself cancelled in late 2003. Black Isle Studios would develop a further spin-off to the series, Baldur\\'s Gate: Dark Alliance II, before being shut down by Interplay on 8 December 2003.[3]\\nIn 2019, Larian Studios announced an unrelated Baldur\\'s Gate 3. It was released in 2023 to critical acclaim.\\nSeveral interviews shed light on gameplay components, with the most prominently being conducted with Winterwind Productions. It would have been built on the same fundamentals as the previous Baldur\\'s Gate games updated to fit the Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition ruleset, meaning it would have used pausable realtime gameplay. Damien Foletto, a developer on the game, hoped to use elements from other games such as The Temple of Elemental Evil. The game was not to be turn-based because it would have had a significant production and marketing cost, requiring a wider audience base to be profitable. The developers intended to draw deeply from a wide variety of D&D source books to offer a diverse selection of weapons. Not all of the weapons were going to be available, but most of them would have been and the player would have been able to do \"crazy\" things with any weapon. As in Fallout 2, no single weapon would have been better than other weapons, and each weapon would have had its own traits.[4]\\nOriginally, players would have only been able to advance up to level 5. This was later changed to level 8. This was for two reasons: for the player to be able to level up to higher levels in the sequels and for the player to use more strategy. The game was originally planned to have players focus less on leveling up and more on using their brains to solve problems presented within the computer game. While there would have been many D&D character classes and races to choose from, the low level cap would necessitate the exclusion of prestige classes.[5]\\nThe game was said to be truly non-linear, where the player has freedom to visit any location and perform any action they wanted, keeping in mind that there will always be repercussions for the player\\'s actions in the game. Failed/incomplete quests would have had consequences as the game progressed. Unlike previous games, the player was able to switch between alignments depending on the actions in the game. This would have also required the player character to make difficult decisions which could affect his reputation with one group in order to maintain his reputation with another.[6]\\nCNPCs would only join a player\\'s party if they agreed with the player\\'s actions. Acting contrary to the intentions and philosophies of CNPCs could result in them leaving the party, attacking the player character, or expressing their discontent in dialogue. Player characters possessing a high enough charisma could mitigate the risk of defection. Just like the original Baldur\\'s Gate, the player could switch freely between their character and CNPCs in their party. Continuing to act against the will of CNPCs could result in the player losing the ability to play as them even if they remained within the party as a follower. Conversations would always be conducted from the perspective of the player character, but CNPCs could interject in conversation depending on applicable skills, charisma scores, and personalities. Properly leveling up the charisma levels of CNPCs could also reduce the risk of potentially violent conflict within the party.[7]\\nPlayer character belonging to the wizard and warlock classes would have access to familiars and animal companions. It\\'s still not known whether familiars and animal companions would be handled as traditional CNPCs or with a new set of mechanics.\\nThere would have been several types of reputations in The Black Hound: Regional Reputation, Factional Reputation, Fame/Infamy, and Epithets. The first three all have positive and negative scales. Some characters may only care about positive reputation in an area, others might only care about negative reputation in an organization, and others might try to balance a number of reputations when they speak to the player. Regional Reputation is a positive/negative counter that depends on the actions the character performs in a specific region. Not only will Factional Reputation affect dealings with certain organizations, it will also affect your dealings with the allies and enemies of those organizations. Fame and Infamy would have been awarded to the player character depending on their actions. Their reputation would be displayed in epithets.[8]\\nThe game was set to take place in the fictional Forgotten Realms continent of Faerûn. It would have been set in the Dalelands and allowed players to travel mostly in the area of Archendale. Players would have also been able to travel to key areas in Archendale such as the White Ford, the Church of Lathander and bases of the Red Wizards of Thay. Other areas in the Dalelands featured would have been Battledale, Deepingdale as well as an area of North Sembia.\\nNone of the characters from the previous Baldur\\'s Gate games would have returned; the cast and story would have been completely original, although characters from the Icewind Dale series would have returned. The reason for this is Icewind Dale was released after Interplay lost the initial D&D license. An original NPC would have been Stellaga Brightstar, a priestess in the Church of Lathander. The game would have revolved around the hunt for May Farrow, an evil cleric who killed a Black Hound. The Black Hound was the representation of the selfish acts of the game\\'s main antagonist and would appear to the player through circumstance and remind him of his actions throughout the game.[9]\\nThe main faction in the game would have been the Archenriders, the first faction encountered by the player; the Church of Lathander would have been a faction at the same importance. The Red Wizards of Thay, the Sembian Silver Ravens, the Malarite People of Black Blood, and the Elves of Deepingdale would have been other major factions in the game that the player would have been allowed to side with. The characters from Icewind Dale that would have appeared would have been the gnome Maralie Fiddlebender and the druid Iselore, who would have appeared in a cameo. The Harpers and the Zhentarim would have also appeared. The Zhentarim would have been seen for part of the game as the Black Network.\\nMay Farrow and her gang of raiders have spent weeks tracking down the black hound, the essence of May\\'s guilt for unleashing a great evil. The player character is resting by the firelight in an old barn to hide from the storm outside when a black hound arrives and after being shot twice by an arrow, it cries one last time before it dies on the player lap. May accuses the player character (PC) of being in league with the dog (meaning she thinks the player character is another essence of her guilt) and almost kills the player before the Riders of Archendale save the PC. They question the PC and take them to the magistrate, who question the PC further and inform the PC not to leave the areas of North Sembia, Archendale, Battledale and Deepingdale. Whenever the player then approaches somebody with great guilt, the black hound appears to him and eventually the player\\'s actions make the player the essence of guilt throughout the four areas mentioned above. As the player unravels more secrets, he learns that he can\\'t kill guilt, thus he cannot kill the black hound or what he has become (the player can physically die, but people won\\'t forget about what the player did). Eventually, he learns the tale of a widowed farmer\\'s wife, taking great guilt in her husband\\'s death as for some reason she believes it is her fault, she tries to resurrect him. She succeeds but finds him to be an abomination and cannot stop him, despite him being very weak at the time. Through the course of the game, the farmer is growing stronger and stronger off the guilt absorbed by the black hound through the player. The player learns of this wife being May Farrow, who believes killing the hound would be a way to stop the farmer, the hound however latched its soul onto the player and uses him as a tunnel to channel guilt to the farmer and as a guide to the world.[10]\\nThe game would not have been a sequel to Baldur\\'s Gate II in terms of story but rather gameplay, however, it did continue part of story of Icewind Dale II through joinable NPC\\'s, specifically Maralie Fiddlebender, who would have been an adult in the story. There was a hound featured in the storybook of Icewind Dale II of which Maralie narrated, according to the developers, the game would have revolved around this hound. The game was also revealed to have a connection to another one of Black Isle Studios games, Project Jackson. Project Jackson was then revealed to be Baldur\\'s Gate: Dark Alliance II. This connection was unknown and as of current, there is only one connection known: a Forgotten Realms setting. It is possible that there could be a story connection due to both the Harpers and the Zhentarim being in the game, but this was never revealed by any developer on the project. It was only stated that the projects were related once in the entire history of the project.[11]\\nDevelopment began on The Black Hound in 2001, concurrently with Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter, under the codenames FR6 and Project Jefferson.[12] Interplay announced plans to develop further sequels to the Baldur\\'s Gate franchise in 2002.[13] The Black Hound was intended to be the first game in a trilogy of Baldur\\'s Gate titles.[14]\\nA new 3D engine was developed for the project to replace the Infinity Engine used in previous Black Isle Studios titles, colloquially referred to as the Jefferson Engine, which drew inspiration from the Aurora Engine developed by BioWare for use in Neverwinter Nights.[15] Key features of the engine included static lighting, support for modular game systems that would allow designers greater flexibility in creating systems outside the constraints of the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset, and an extensive character and monster customization system that would have allowed for a large amount of character variety among enemies and non-player characters.[16] After the game\\'s cancellation, the Jefferson Engine would be used by Black Isle Studios to develop a sequel to the Fallout series codenamed Van Buren until the game\\'s cancellation in late 2003.\\nThe Black Hound was cancelled when Interplay lost the rights to develop further Dungeons & Dragons games for PC, having shifted development focus towards console-focused spinoffs such as Baldur\\'s Gate: Dark Alliance and Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel.[2][16] Black Isle Studios would develop Baldur\\'s Gate: Dark Alliance 2 before being shut down by Interplay in 2003.[17] Further development on the series would be halted due to legal disputes between Interplay and Dark Alliance developer Snowblind Studios over Interplay\\'s unauthorized use of the Dark Alliance engine.[18]\\nMembers of the Black Isle Studios development team later went on to form Obsidian Entertainment, where they would develop Neverwinter Nights 2 and its expansions. Josh Sawyer, designer on The Black Hound and Neverwinter Nights 2, later expressed an interest in using the user-generated content tools of Neverwinter Nights 2 to develop the Black Hound concept into a content module for the game.[16]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nForgotten Realms is a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) fantasy role-playing game. Commonly referred to by players and game designers as \"The Realms\", it was created by game designer Ed Greenwood around 1967 as a setting for his childhood stories.[1] Several years later, it was published for the D&D game as a series of magazine articles, and the first Realms game products were released in 1987. Role-playing game products have been produced for the setting ever since, in addition to novels, role-playing video game adaptations (including the first massively multiplayer online role-playing game to use graphics), comic books, and the film Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.[2]\\nForgotten Realms is a fantasy world setting, described as a world of strange lands, dangerous creatures, and mighty deities, where magic and supernatural phenomena are very real. The premise is that, long ago, planet Earth and the world of the Forgotten Realms were more closely connected. As time passed, the inhabitants of Earth had mostly forgotten about the existence of that other world – hence the name Forgotten Realms. The original Forgotten Realms logo, which was used until 2000, had small runic letters that read \"Herein lie the lost lands\" as an allusion to the connection between the two worlds.[citation needed]\\nForgotten Realms is one of the most popular D&D settings,[3][4] largely due to the success of novels by authors such as R. A. Salvatore and numerous role-playing video games, including Pool of Radiance (1988), Eye of the Beholder (1991), Icewind Dale (2000), the Neverwinter Nights and the Baldur\\'s Gate series.\\nEd Greenwood began writing stories about the Forgotten Realms as a child, starting at the age of eight.[5]:\\u200a72\\u200a He came up with the name from the notion of a multiverse of parallel worlds; Earth is one such world, and the Realms another. In Greenwood\\'s original conception, the fantastic legends of Earth derive from a fantasy world that can no longer be accessed.[6] Greenwood discovered the Dungeons & Dragons game in 1975, and became a serious role-playing enthusiast with the first Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) game releases in 1978.[6] Greenwood brought his fantasy world into the new medium of role-playing games when a university student named September invited him to play AD&D with her.[5]:\\u200a72\\u200a Greenwood then starting using the setting for his personal role-playing campaign.[7] Greenwood began a Realms campaign in the city of Waterdeep before creating a group known as the Knights of Myth Drannor in the Shadowdale region. Greenwood felt that his players\\' thirst for detail made the Realms what it is: \"They want it to seem real, and work on \\'honest jobs\\' and personal activities, until the whole thing grows into far more than a casual campaign. Roleplaying always governs over rules, and the adventures seem to develop themselves.\"[6] Greenwood has stated that his own version of the Forgotten Realms, as run in his personal campaign, is much darker than published versions.[8]\\nStarting in 1979, Greenwood published a series of articles that detailed the setting in The Dragon (later Dragon) magazine, the first of which was about a monster known as the curst.[5]:\\u200a72\\u200a Greenwood continued to write extensive articles for Dragon, in which he used the Forgotten Realms as the setting to detail magic items, monsters, and spells.[7] When Gary Gygax \"lost control of TSR in 1985, the company saw an opportunity to move beyond Greyhawk and introduce a new default setting\".[9]:\\u200a87\\u200a In 1986, TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for AD&D,[5]:\\u200a72\\u200a and assigned Jeff Grubb to find out more about the setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in Dragon.[9]\\nGreenwood states that Grubb asked him \"Do you just make this stuff up as you go, or do you really have a huge campaign world?\", and Greenwood answered \"yes\" to both questions.[6] TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than its epic fantasy counterpart Dragonlance, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign setting upon deciding to publish AD&D 2nd edition.[6] Greenwood agreed to work on the project and began working to get Forgotten Realms officially published.[10] He sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the setting for a token fee.[6] He noted that TSR altered his original conception of the Realms being a place that could be accessed from Earth, as \"[c]oncerns over possible lawsuits (kids getting hurt while trying to \\'find a gate\\') led TSR to de-emphasize this meaning\".[6]\\nJon Peterson, author of Dungeons and Dragons Art and Arcana: A Visual History, said that Greenwood \"was that rare obsessive DM who just seemed to have more ideas and energy to pour into his world than even the folks at TSR did. Naturally when TSR was shopping for new campaign worlds as part of their cross-media strategy, they had to get the Forgotten Realms. R. A. Salvatore took Greenwood\\'s world and created characters and stories for it that made him a bestselling author and sustained TSR as a major fantasy book publisher\".[11]\\nIn 1985, the AD&D module Bloodstone Pass was released by TSR and is retroactively considered to be a part of the Forgotten Realms,[12] although it was not until the module The Bloodstone Wars was released that it became the official setting for the module series.[13] Douglas Niles had worked on a novel trilogy with a Celtic theme, which were then altered to become the first novels set in the Forgotten Realms, starting with Darkwalker on Moonshae (1987).[5]:\\u200a73\\u200a It is the first book in The Moonshae Trilogy, which predates the Forgotten Realms Campaign Set by one month.[14]\\nThe Forgotten Realms Campaign Set was later released in 1987[9] as a boxed set of two source books (Cyclopedia of the Realms and DM\\'s Sourcebook of the Realms) and four large color maps, designed by Greenwood in collaboration with Grubb.[15]:\\u200a99\\u200a It sold ca. one hundred fifty thousand times in its first two years.[16] The set introduced the campaign setting and explained how to use it,[15]:\\u200a99\\u200a and reserved space on the map for SSI\\'s Gold Box computer role-playing games set in the Forgotten Realms.[17]\\nTSR began incorporating elements by other designers into the Forgotten Realms, including the Moonshae Isles by Douglas Niles, the \"Desert of Desolation\" by Tracy Hickman and Laura Hickman, and Kara-Tur by Zeb Cook.[5]:\\u200a73\\u200a The setting also provided a new way for TSR to market its Battlesystem rules, which it had supported with the Bloodstone adventure sequence which started with Bloodstone Pass; the last two adventures in the series, The Bloodstone Wars (1987) and The Throne of Bloodstone (1988), were unambiguously set in the Forgotten Realms.[5]:\\u200a74\\u200a Some characters from Egg of the Phoenix (1987) by Frank Mentzer were incorporated into The Savage Frontier (1988).[5]:\\u200a40\\u200a\\nThe compilation module Desert of Desolation reworked the previous adventures to fit as part of the Forgotten Realms.[18] The module Under Illefarn published in 1987 is set in the Forgotten Realms,[15]:\\u200a108\\u200a as is the module released in 1988, Swords of the Iron Legion.[15]:\\u200a103\\u200a\\nR. A. Salvatore wrote his first novel for the Forgotten Realms, The Crystal Shard (1988), which was originally set in the Moonshae Islands before being moved to a new location and introduced the drow character Drizzt Do\\'Urden.[5]:\\u200a73\\u200a[19] Drizzt has since appeared in more than seventeen subsequent novels, many of which have appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list.[20] In 1988, the first in a line of Forgotten Realms role-playing video games, Pool of Radiance, was released by Strategic Simulations, Inc.[21] The game was popular and won the Origins Award for \"Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988\".[22]\\nSeveral supplements to the original boxed set were released under the first edition rules, beginning with Waterdeep and the North,[5]:\\u200a73\\u200a which was followed by Moonshae in 1987, and Empires of the Sands, The Magister, The Savage Frontier, Dreams of the Red Wizards, and Lords of Darkness in 1988.[15]:\\u200a96–97\\u200a The City System boxed set was released in 1988, and it contained several maps of the city of Waterdeep.[15]:\\u200a89\\u200a Ruins of Adventure, a module based on the computer game Pool of Radiance, was also released in 1988.[15]:\\u200a113\\u200a\\nThe boxed set Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms was released in 1988. It gives details of the lands of Kara-Tur, and was designed to be used with the 1986 book Oriental Adventures, which officially placed the book in the Forgotten Realms world.[15]:\\u200a103\\u200a\\nIn 1989, DC Comics began publishing a series of Forgotten Realms comics written by Grubb.[5]:\\u200a75\\u200a Each issue contains twenty-six pages, illustrated primarily by Rags Morales and Dave Simons. Twenty-five issues were published in total, with the last being released in 1991. A fifty-six page annual Forgotten Realms Comic Annual #1: Waterdhavian Nights, illustrated by various artists, was released in 1990.\\nCurse of the Azure Bonds, a module based on the role-playing video game of the same name, was released in 1989.[15]:\\u200a97\\u200a\\nTo transition the Forgotten Realms from first edition AD&D to the ruleset\\'s second edition, a story involving the gods being cast down was planned by TSR management from the top-down and started with Hall of Heroes (1989) and continued with a three-adventure Avatar series (1989) and a three-novel Avatar series (1989), and some stories in the comic book.[5]:\\u200a84\\u200a TSR adjusted the timeline of the Forgotten Realms by advancing the calendar one year forward to 1358 DR, referring to the gap as the Time of Troubles.[9]\\nIn early 1990, the hardcover Forgotten Realms Adventures by Grubb and Greenwood was released, which introduced the setting to AD&D 2nd edition;[15]:\\u200a99–100\\u200a the book also detailed how the Time of Troubles had changed the setting.[23]:\\u200a139\\u200a The Ruins of Undermountain (1991) was one of the first published mega-dungeons.[5]:\\u200a93\\u200a The Al-Qadim setting by Jeff Grubb was released in 1992, and the setting was added to the southern part of the Forgotten Realms.[5]:\\u200a95\\u200a In July 1990, the RPGA Network\\'s Polyhedron Newszine began publishing a monthly column by Greenwood entitled \"The Everwinking Eye\" detailing various locations and personalities in the Realms. The Network used the Forgotten Realms city of Ravens Bluff as the setting for their first living campaign.[5]:\\u200a93\\u200a Official RPGA support for this product line included the Living City module series. A number of sub-settings of the Forgotten Realms were briefly supported in the early 1990s. Three more modules were produced for the Kara-Tur setting. The Horde boxed set, released in 1990, detailed the Hordelands, which featured a series of three modules. The Maztica Campaign Set, released in 1991, detailed the continent of Maztica.\\nThe original gray boxed set was revised in 1993 to update it to AD&D 2nd edition, with the release of a new Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting boxed set containing three books (A Grand Tour of the Realms, Running the Realms, and Shadowdale) and various \"monster supplements\".[24] Additional material for the setting was released steadily throughout the 1990s. Forgotten Realms novels, such as the Legacy of the Drow series, the first three books of The Elminster Series, and numerous anthologies were also released throughout the 1990s, which led to the setting being hailed as one of the most successful shared fantasy universes of the 1990s.[25] By the first quarter of 1996, TSR had published sixty-four novels set in the Forgotten Realms out of the 242 novels set in AD&D worlds.[26]:\\u200a20\\u200a These novels in turn sparked interest in role-playing by new gamers.[27]\\nNumerous Forgotten Realms video games were released between 1990 and 2000. Eye of the Beholder for MS-DOS was released in 1990,[28] which was followed by two sequels: the first in 1991,[29] and the second in 1992.[30] All three games were re-released for MS-DOS compatible operating systems on a single disk in 1995.[31] Another 1991 release was Neverwinter Nights on America Online, the first graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).[32] In 1998, Baldur\\'s Gate, the first in a line of popular role-playing video games[33] developed by BioWare and \"considered by most pundits as the hands-down best PC roleplaying game ever\", was released.[1] The game was followed by a sequel, Baldur\\'s Gate II: Shadows of Amn, in 2000 and Icewind Dale, a separate game that utilized the same game engine as Baldur\\'s Gate. Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor was released in 2001. Several popular Forgotten Realms characters such as Drizzt Do\\'Urden and Elminster made minor appearances in these games.\\nWhen Wizards of the Coast took over publication of Dungeons & Dragons after purchasing TSR in 1997, they trimmed production down from six campaign settings to Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance, and completed AD&D 2nd edition production sometime between 1998 and 1999.[34]:\\u200a146\\u200a They later hired Rob Heinsoo to be part of the D&D Worlds team and focus on Forgotten Realms in the third edition of Dungeons & Dragons.[34]:\\u200a162\\u200a An official material update and a timeline advance were introduced to the Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition in 2001 with the release of the hardcover book the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting,[35] which won the Origins Award for Best Role-Playing Game Supplement of 2001 in 2002.[36] The timeline was officially advanced from 1358 DR to 1372 DR.[9] The adventure City of the Spider Queen (2002) did not meet its projected sales targets, so Wizards of the Coast cut back on production of new adventures.[34]:\\u200a165\\u200a\\nIn 2002, BioWare released Neverwinter Nights, set in the northern reaches of Faerûn and operating on the revised 3.0 rules for D&D. It was followed by two expansion packs: Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark. A sequel using version 3.5 of the rules was produced by Obsidian Entertainment in 2006, and was followed by the expansion sets Mask of the Betrayer and Storm of Zehir. The Forgotten Realms Deluxe Edition compilation was released in 2006, containing the Baldur\\'s Gate series (excluding the Dark Alliance games), Icewind Dale series, and all Neverwinter Nights games before Neverwinter Nights 2.\\nWith the release of Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition in 2008, Wizards opted for a publishing plan featuring a series of six books per year – consisting of three core rulebooks as well as three setting books – beginning with the Forgotten Realms. The company started the cycle with the Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide (2008), the Forgotten Realms Player\\'s Guide (2008), and Scepter Tower of Spellgard.[34]:\\u200a190\\u200a These books updated the Forgotten Realms to the newest rules system which altered the setting drastically to make it fit with the 4th edition concept of \"Points of Light\".[34]:\\u200a190\\u200a\\nThe main lore change centered around an event called the Spellplague in 1385 DR.[9] This cataclysm was unleashed when the goddess of magic Mystra was killed, \"transforming whole nations and altering creatures. In addition, parts of Toril have fused with its long-lost twin world Abeir, whisking away some countries and adding new ones. The Underdark is more open to the surface. Thay has become a nightmare land of death and the Elves, sensing the newfound connection to the Feywild, have returned to Faerûn in force\".[37] The event moved the fictional world\\'s timeline 94 years into the future to 1479 DR.[9] The Spellplague acted as \"a narrative justification for design changes\".[9]:\\u200a107\\u200a\\nIn 2008, the Forgotten Realms also became the setting for the RPGA\\'s sole living campaign, Living Forgotten Realms, replacing Living Greyhawk.\\nIn 2011, the Neverwinter Campaign Setting was released which launched the 4th edition\\'s first major multimedia release. The Forgotten Realms city setting spawned four novels by R. A. Salvatore called the Neverwinter Saga, a comic book, and a board game called The Legend of Drizzt, as well as two video games – the Facebook game Heroes of Neverwinter (2011–2012) and a MMORPG called Neverwinter (2013).[38] Laura Tommervik, from the Wizards of the Coast marketing team, explained the approach: \"We use Neverwinter as the connective tissue across multiple product categories. The transmedia campaign is an opportunity for fans to experience the brand however they choose to\".[38]\\n\\nIn 2013, Wizards of the Coast announced a year-long event called the Sundering which acted as a multimedia project to transition the Forgotten Realms to the next edition of the game.[39][40] This release included a weekly D&D Encounters in-store play event, a free-to-play mobile game Arena of War (2013), and a collaborative novel series: The Companions (2013) by R. A. Salvatore, The Godborn (2013) by Paul S. Kemp, The Adversary (2013) by Erin Evans, The Reaver (2014) by Richard Lee Byers, The Sentinel (2014) by Troy Denning, and The Herald (2014) by Ed Greenwood.[39][41] Liz Schuh, Head of Publishing and Licensing for Dungeons & Dragons, said:[42]The Sundering is the last of a series of ground-shaking events. It really affects the whole world of the Forgotten Realms in a major way. You may remember when the Spell Plagues began, the two worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Abeir and Toril, crashed together. That created both geographic changes (the map of the Forgotten Realms and Faerûn actually changed due to that collision), and also changed the way magic works. It changed the pantheon of the gods. The Sundering is all about those two worlds separating—coming apart—and the process of that separation is really the story that we\\'re telling over the next year. At the end of this story arc, Abeir and Toril will be separate again, and many of the things that happened when they crashed together will go back to the way they were before. So magic will be much like it was before the Spell Plague. Markings that marked spell-plagued people and animals will fade and go away. It\\'s really about moving the Forgotten Realms forward, but also about bringing it around to the most beloved and most fondly remembered Forgotten Realms. The result of The Second Sundering, in game terms, was the transition from 4th edition rules to 5th edition rules of Dungeons & Dragons, published in 2014.[9][43]\\nWhen D&D 5th edition was published in 2014, Wizards of the Coast announced that the Forgotten Realms would continue to serve as the official campaign setting for its upcoming published adventure materials.[44][45][46] The village of Phandalin in the Forgotten Realms acted as the primary setting for the new 5th edition Starter Set (2014) which was published before the release of three new core rulebooks.[47] \"Tyranny of Dragons\" was the first multimedia storyline for the new edition and included two adventure modules, Hoard of the Dragon Queen (2014) and The Rise of Tiamat (2014), and an update to the Neverwinter (2013) video game.[9][48][49] The next two storylines, \"Elemental Evil\" which included Princes of the Apocalypse (2015) and \"Rage of Demons\" which included Out of the Abyss (2015), were also set in the Forgotten Realms.[9][50][51]\\nThe first campaign guide for the new edition, the Sword Coast Adventurer\\'s Guide (2015), was released on November 3, 2015, and only covered a fraction of the Forgotten Realms.[52][9] It describes the 2013 Sundering event, referred to as the Second Sundering in the book, and its consequences in game terms and lore.[53] The video game Sword Coast Legends (2015) published by Digital Extremes was also released in the same month as the tabletop campaign guide.[52][54] The adventure module Storm King\\'s Thunder (2016) \"sprawls over the northern Forgotten Realms–from Waterdeep to Icewind Dale\".[55] 5th edition details on \"the rest of Faerûn had been untouched until the Tomb of Annihilation (2017), an adventure that leaves the northern Sword Coast for the southern jungles of Chult\".[9]:\\u200a101\\u200a The official Dungeons & Dragons actual play web series Rivals of Waterdeep, which premiered in 2018, is set in the Forgotten Realms. It adapted adventure modules such as Waterdeep: Dragon Heist (2018), Baldur\\'s Gate: Descent Into Avernus (2019) and Candlekeep Mysteries (2021) which are also set in the Forgotten Realms.[56][57]\\nIn 2023, the Forgotten Realms role-playing video game Baldur\\'s Gate 3 (2023) was released by Larian Studios.[58] It had record-breaking awards success such as becoming the first game to win Game of the Year, or the equivalent category, at all five major ceremonies: the Golden Joystick Awards, the Game Developers Choice Awards, the DICE Awards, the BAFTAs, and The Game Awards.[59] Also released in 2023 was the film Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves which is set in the Forgotten Realms and features Neverwinter as a major location.[60][61]\\nDungeons & Dragons: The Twenty-Sided Tavern is a stage production which combines actual play, improv, and immersive theater as the player cast navigate a Dungeons & Dragons adventure set in the Forgotten Realms. It officially opened on off-Broadway on May 5, 2024, at Stage 42 in New York City;[62] it closed on May 11, 2025.[63] In December 2024, it opened at the Sydney Opera House\\'s Studio venue in Sydney;[64] it closed on April 6, 2025.[65] The U.S. national tour began in July 2025.[63]\\nWizards of the Coast released the 2024 revision to the 5th Edition ruleset which updates preexisting player options while introducing new content to the game. This included releasing new backward compatible  versions of the core rulebooks.[66][67] Two Forgotten Realms focused sourcebooks – Heroes of Faerûn (2025) and Adventures in Faerûn (2025) – are scheduled for release in November 2025.[68][69] Following the announcement of these sourcebooks, Game Rant noted that \"outside the brief documentation for many areas in the Storm King\\'s Thunder adventure, the only real sourcebook the [Forgotten Realms] setting saw [in 5th Edition] was the Sword Coast Adventurer\\'s Guide\".[70] Heroes of Faerûn (2025) is aimed at players and \"will include new subclasses, feats, backgrounds, items, along with new rules for Circle magic, a gazeteer-style guide to the Realms, a guide to the gods of the Realms, and more information about the factions that rule Faerûn\".[68] Adventures in Faerûn (2025) is aimed at dungeon masters and will include adventures, monsters and villains along with details on \"five different settings: Baldur\\'s Gate, Calimshan, the Dalelands, the Moonshae Isles, and Icewind Dale\".[68] Additionally, three corresponding digital expansions will be released exclusively on D&D Beyond in November 2025 – Astarion\\'s Book of Hungers (2025) with vampire themed player options and adventures, Netheril\\'s Fall (2025) which features a time-traveling adventure, and an untitled third book.[71][72]\\nThe focus of the Forgotten Realms setting is the continent of Faerûn, the western part of a continent that was roughly modeled after the Eurasian continent on Earth.[26]:\\u200a6\\u200a The lands of the Forgotten Realms are not all ruled by the human race, with populations of many humanoid races and creatures ubiquitous in fantasy fiction works such as dwarves, elves, goblins, and orcs. Technologically, the world of the Forgotten Realms resembles the pre-industrial Earth in the 13th or 14th century. However, the presence of magic provides an additional element of power to the societies. There are several nation states and many independent cities, with loose alliances being formed for defense or conquest. Trade is performed by ship or horse-drawn vehicle, and manufacturing is based upon cottage industry.\\nThe Forgotten Realms is part of the fictional world of Abeir-Toril (usually just called Toril[23]:\\u200a91\\u200a), an Earth-like planet with many real-world influences and consists of several large continents.[73] It was first detailed in the original Forgotten Realms Campaign Set, published in 1987 by TSR.[74] The other continents of Toril include Kara-Tur, Zakhara, Maztica,[73] and other yet unspecified landmasses.[35] Kara-Tur, roughly corresponding to ancient East Asia, was later the focus of its own source book Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms, published in 1988.[15]:\\u200a103\\u200a[75] There is also a vast subterranean world called the Underdark beneath the surface.[23]:\\u200a98,\\u200a138\\u200a[51]\\nIn early editions of the setting, The Realms shared a unified cosmology with various other campaign settings called the Great Wheel. In this way each of the Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings were linked together to form one interwoven world connected by various planes of existence. With the release of the 2001 Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, the setting was given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings.[35][76]\\nReligion plays a large part in the Forgotten Realms, with deities and their followers being an integral part of the world. Deities interact directly in mortal affairs, answer prayers, and have their own personal agendas. All deities must have worshipers to survive, and all mortals must worship a patron deity to secure a good afterlife. A huge number of diverse deities exist within several polytheistic pantheons; a large number of supplements have documented many of them, some in more detail than others.[77][78] Greenwood created a pantheon of gods for his home Dungeons & Dragons game, in his Forgotten Realms world, which were introduced in his article \"Down-to-earth divinity\" from Dragon #54 (October 1981).[79]\\nWhen the Forgotten Realms was published as a setting in 1987, the pantheon added Waukeen, the goddess of trade, money, and wealth, who was created by one of Jeff Grubb\\'s players, and added to the Forgotten Realms by Grubb.[citation needed] Tyche was replaced with Tymora, and the elemental lords from Melniboné were replaced by Akadi, Grumbar, Istishia, and Kossuth.[80]\\nMuch of the history of the Forgotten Realms detailed in novels and source books concerns the actions of various deities and The Chosen (mortal representatives with a portion of their deities\\' power) such as Elminster, Fzoul Chembryl, Midnight (who later became the new embodiment of the goddess of magic, Mystra[23]:\\u200a140\\u200a), and the Seven Sisters. Above all other deities is Ao, the Overlord, who does not sanction worshipers and distances himself from mortals. He is single-handedly responsible for the Time of Troubles, or Godswar, as seen in The Avatar Trilogy.[81][82]\\nThe setting is home to several noteworthy recurring characters that have gained wider reception, including:\\nIn his book The Fantasy Roleplaying Gamer\\'s Bible, Sean Patrick Fannon describes the Forgotten Realms as being \"the most ambitious fantasy game setting published since Tekumel\",[1] and that it \"may be the most widely played-in game setting in RPG history\".[1] Similarly, in literature, the novels written in the Forgotten Realms setting have formed one of \"the industry\\'s leading fantasy series\".[119] Over time these novels have gained \"unprecedented popularity\",[120] which led, as Marc Oxoby noted in his book, The 1990s, to the novels having an \"extraordinary shelf life\", remaining in print for many years.[120] This popular reception has also been reflected in public libraries; for example, Joyce Saricks states in The Readers\\' Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction that the novels have been among the most requested books by fans of the fantasy genre.[121] D&D chroniclers Michael Witwer et al., in the book Dungeons & Dragons Art & Arcana, noted that the \"level of Tolkienesque history and detail that Greenwood had infused in his creation - and almost \"real world\" quality - granted the Realms an irresistible allure [...]. While at its core the Forgotten Realms is a familiar, almost traditional, medieval-styled fantasy setting, it boasted unprecedented scope\". \"It is, quite simply, Dungeons & Dragons at its very core.\"[16]\\nAubrey Sitterson, for PC Magazine, included the Forgotten Realms in a 2015 roundup of the \"11 Best Dungeons & Dragons Campaign Settings\" and wrote that \"for most people, Forgotten Realms is synonymous with Dungeons & Dragons, and with good reason: it\\'s the setting that played home to the massively popular Baldur\\'s Gate video game, as well as R. A. Salvatore\\'s Drizzt books. Currently, it\\'s the only campaign setting actively supported by D&D makers Wizards of the Coast, which would be restrictive if Forgotten Realms wasn\\'t such an incredibly diverse place, housing classic European middle ages tropes, as well as a heroic fantasy take on African, Middle Eastern, and other real-world cultures\".[122] Brian Silliman, for SYFY Wire in 2017, described the Forgotten Realms as \"a classic fantasy backdrop\" and highlighted that \"at one time in our history, our world and this one were connected, but over time this magical realm was, well, forgotten. It is an ideal place for any D&D adventure, inspiring limitless possibilities for any smirking dungeon master\".[123] In 2019, academic Philip J. Clements called the \"highly popular\" Forgotten Realms \"an unusually well-developed D&D setting\" and \"more-or-less the flagship setting for D&D\". He also noted that it has received the greatest number of supplements.[124]\\nIn a retrospective on the legacy of Dungeons & Dragons, academic Daniel Heath Justice commented that the \"Forgotten Realms was explicitly based on the civilized-versus-savage binary and leaned in hard on racial essentialism in its sadistic black-skinned drow led by vicious matriarchs and their terrible spider goddess, firmly melding anti-Blackness with misogyny, a once-civilized people gone feral under the debased rule of women\".[125]\\nThe 4th edition update to the Forgotten Realms brought massive lore changes which were \"tied to a number of other design philosophies\" and the Forgotten Realms \"simultaneously had become a grittier setting, on the edge of collapse, while also becoming a more fantastic one, full of wonder and mystery\".[126] Jason Wilson, for VentureBeat, highlighted that unlike the Time of Troubles cataclysm, the 4th edition Spellplague cataclysm was \"one players never embraced in the same manner as the earlier disaster\".[127] Shannon Appelcline, author of Designers & Dragons, wrote:\\n[The 4th edition] Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide may be the most controversial D&D book ever produced by Wizards. That\\'s entirely due to the large-scale destruction of the Realms. Similar updates have been tried by other companies — to reinvigorate settings, to make them more accessible to new players, or to make them more adventuresome. [...] It never seems to go well, because old fans feel left behind. With that said, some folks did love the changes, because the setting was now more playable, more accessible, more fantastic, and more PC centered. [...] Meanwhile, a series of adventures and novels called The Sundering (2013–2014) reversed many of the 4e changes to the Realms, but without rebooting the timeline. Instead, the Realms continues to evolve and advance, as it has since its earlier days.[126]\\nR. A. Salvatore was also publicly unhappy with the 4th edition changes to the Forgotten Realms:[128] [B]asically, we authors were handed a document and told how things were going to be. We were asked our opinions, but they mattered very little – the changes were being driven from a different direction. [...] To have characters that have built such a strong history, then have that upset on the orders of someone else was very disconcerting. I will admit that the abrupt changes forced me into an uncomfortable place, and from that place came some of the better things I\\'ve written, but I very much preferred the way it was done this time, with 5th Edition and the changes, where we, the authors, were told what was happening to the game and asked how we could make the world and the lore live and breathe it.Christian Hoffer, for ComicBook.com, reported that Wizards of the Coast\\'s 5th edition publishing strategy, which focuses on the Forgotten Realms and newer intellectual property for campaign settings, has created a rift in the fan base where some \"feel that this push for new players has come at the cost of keeping the game\\'s current players sated\" by not updating campaign settings that \"predate the Forgotten Realms\". Hoffer highlighted that Wizards of the Coast has a much slower publication schedule than with previous editions with a focus on quality and profit and \"the D&D teams knows that they have plenty of great campaign settings in their back pocket and are either actively developing more settings or have ideas for them further down the line\".[129] Francesco Cacciatore of Polygon noted that the 3rd Edition Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting (2001) sourcebook was \"an ambitious attempt at a comprehensive look at the Realms, and while many locations remained sketched, it was still enough to feed our imagination (and campaigns) for decades\".[68] However, its 4th Edition \"equivalent\" was overlooked by many players \"due to the mess that the Spellplague event was, lore-wise\" and while \"players were excited for a \\'return to form\\' for the Forgotten Realms\" when the 5th Edition undid most Spellplague changes, details have been \"limited in scope\" since \"the majority of D&D 5e products set in the Forgotten Realms focused on the Sword Coast and its adjacent areas\".[68] Following the announcement of the Adventures in Faerûn (2025) for the revised 5th Edition, Cacciatore commented that while he was \"disappointed\" to see two regions previously explored in 5th Edition campaign books would be included, he was also \"excited to get the first good glimpse at the Dales, Calimshan, and the Moonshae Isles in more than two decades\".[68]\\n']"
